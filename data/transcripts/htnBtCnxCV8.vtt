it's a pleasure to be here with you
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
today I have for your consideration
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 206 which seeks to expand
 
00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
the definition of endangerment to
 
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
include corporal punishment as defined
 
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Health and Human
 
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.370 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as you know this bill passed
 
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate it also passed
 
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
unanimously out of our
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
um our committee and really this issue
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
was brought to the attention of the
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission of children's
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
services in which I chair and I see a
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
few members of that commission presently
 
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
here on the on your committee as well
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony that multiple
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
families who send their children to the
 
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
same daycare facility all discovered
 
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
that a daycare worker had been
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
submitting their children to corporal
 
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
submitting their children to corporal
punishment

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
when the families call the police and
 
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
Services they were told unfortunately
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
there was nothing that could be done
 
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
because of a loophole in current laws
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
and regulations so this bill does two
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
things Mr chairman it makes it clear it
 
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
is a crime for a daycare worker to
 
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
commit corporal punishment and it makes
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
clear that corporal punishment fits the
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse in our child care
 
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.689 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse in our child care
regulations

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
the goal Mr chairman is that this
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
situation never happens again to another
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
family I cannot imagine
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
being a parent a mom or a dad and
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
dropping my child off at a daycare
 
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
center uh thinking that they're going to
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
be safe and they're going to be
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
and find out that for whatever reason
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly there is no reason for
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
a child to be
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
hit or have any kind of corporal
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
punishment in a facility that you picked
 
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
because you wanted your child to be safe
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
without making these changes that
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
daycare worker who inflicted emotional
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
and physical harm on some of our state's
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
youngest children can work at another
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
facility with no licensing ramifications
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um today here there are two
 
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
parents of one of these children they're
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
here to testify today as well as an
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
attorney who can answer any legal
 
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have so at this
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
point Mr chairman I will end my
 
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will try to answer
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
questions but please be advised the
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
experts are behind me I think you have a
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic audience from the
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
conversations held before we started one
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
thing I want to
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
say is that at the end of the bill there
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
is a statement it's to be that necessary
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
force will be limited to minimal
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
physical contact necessary I see so many
 
00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
bills come before us that are
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
overreactions this was done wrong so the
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
the counter pose is you can't do
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
anything and that causes other problems
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
so it does not totally eliminate
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
physical contact correct
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
there was concern Mr chair because
 
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.050 align:start position:0%
there was concern Mr chair because
oftentimes

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you know you have to in order to
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
protect a child say uh that old um story
 
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
where they're reaching for a stove and
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
you grab the child and you pull the
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
child away because you don't want them
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
to get hurt
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
um that's very different than corporal
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
punishment and I think this legislation
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
really tries to make that distinction
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
um or you might have a child that's
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
running and you're afraid they're going
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
to fall and you grab them so you prevent
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
them from falling so
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
um again I think this legislation allows
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
that flexibility because I think we all
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
know that there is a difference between
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
those two types of situations where
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
you're trying to protect a child from
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
hurting themselves versus someone who
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
whacks a child on the top of the head or
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
wax them on their bottom or grabs and
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
twists at their arms I think two very
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
very different situations
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I look forward to seeing
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
you all again at 11.
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is my children and family law day I
 
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.930 align:start position:0%
this is my children and family law day I
know

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Molly Morris sets
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
and you asked for three minutes and I'll
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
give you three minutes because as I say
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
I think you have a very sympathetic
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
you do
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chair chairman Pearson for
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
um allowing me to share my experience
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
and I got a little emotional listening
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
to Senator Carson so please forgive me
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Senator Carson for
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
bringing this important legislation
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
forward my name is Molly Morissette I'm
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
an elementary teacher in Chichester New
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I come to you to share an
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
experience experience as a parent of
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
young children and child care in this
 
00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.769 align:start position:0%
young children and child care in this
state

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
um in January of 2022 my family
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
experienced something I wish to prevent
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
from happening to any other children and
 
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
families in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
my son Walter was three at the time and
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
entering a multi-age child care
 
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:10.820 align:start position:0%
classroom at a local daycare facility
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
early on in the fall we noticed that he
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
started demonstrating some challenging
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
behaviors he was having a lot of trouble
 
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
with impulse control and listening but
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
most noticeably was when we would ask
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
him to do something as simple as put his
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
shoes on in the morning he'd get this
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
panicked look in his eyes as you walk
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
towards him and would run away from us
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that sent us to seek out some
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy help to see how we
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
could get him kind of through these
 
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.269 align:start position:0%
could get him kind of through these
challenges

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
when I received a phone call about him
 
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
being grabbed aggressively by a staff
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
member at his child care facility it all
 
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:45.860 align:start position:0%
made sense
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
we were told by the administration that
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
an investigation through the child care
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
licensing unit would be conducted and
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
that all of our questions would be
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
answered in the findings report that
 
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:57.740 align:start position:0%
report led me to be standing here today
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
the findings stated that the staff
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
member had used corporal punishment
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
which is against child care licensing
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
regulations the report also said that
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
the staff member admitted to using
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment at least once a week
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
since June of 2021 without being spoken
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
to by her administrator about her
 
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.389 align:start position:0%
to by her administrator about her
behavior

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
I was devastated to learn that this was
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
going on and harming not only my son but
 
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
other children in the child care
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
facility as well other child care
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
employees were also stated in the
 
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
findings report saying that they had
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
shared instances with the director of
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
witnessing this type of abuse in the
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
past and nothing was done about it to me
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
these statements should have been
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
incriminating I then asked what happens
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
next to these individuals and the short
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
answer I got was nothing
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
how could there be no recourse or
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
punishment for an individual who
 
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
assaulted my child an administrator who
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
allowed this to happen surely there has
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
to be something that follows an
 
00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:56.339 align:start position:0%
individual in this profession and
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from working with
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
children again
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
as an educator I know the repercussions
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
of such behavior in a public school
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
setting why is it not the same for those
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
who work in child care after many
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
conversations with a child care
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
licensing unit the ombudsman's office
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
Concord PD the office of the child
 
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
advocate and attorneys I learned that
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's a gap in the law that allows for
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
people in child care who commit corporal
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
punishment against children to get off
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
without any long-term consequences for
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
their behavior
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
this seems to fill the common sense test
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
and for this reason I'm asking that
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment be illegal in child
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
care facilities and that those who use
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment are prohibited from
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
working with children ever again when
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment is used in child
 
00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:41.579 align:start position:0%
care facilities it needs to be part of
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
mandatory mandatory reporting and
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal charges
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
to be honest I thought this was already
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
the state of the law and was in
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
disbelief to find out that this pattern
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
of behavior could continue and that a
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
person who preys on the vulnerable could
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
just go and get another job in another
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
child care facility thus putting more
 
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:01.940 align:start position:0%
children at risk
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to share my
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
experience with you it is my job as a
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
mom to speak for my child when they
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
cannot and it's part of my professional
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
calling to be an advocate for children
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I'd be happy
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%

chairman thank you
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
what exactly was the type of corporal
 
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
punishment that you
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh in your case because you brought this
 
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.490 align:start position:0%
uh in your case because you brought this
forward

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
so my son was playing with other
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
children in the non-nap room so the kids
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
who didn't fall asleep at nap playing in
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
the non-nap room with another child and
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
they were pretending to wash toys with a
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
face cloth and the child put the face
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
cloth down my child picked it up the
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
teacher then grabbed my son by the front
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
of the shirt dragged him across and
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
screamed in his face grabbed the face
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
cloth and said why would you ever take
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
that from another child I see that
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
you're crying but this is all your fault
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
and this is the one that was witnessed
 
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
but you don't know if there were others
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
and then my son was again crying and
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's what led to this
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Heather menezes do I
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.150 align:start position:0%
attorney I work at Shaheen and Gordon
um

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
I met Molly and some other families
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
because they were looking for answers
 
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
um and frankly the the answer was this
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
is a legislative fix
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
basically what was was happening was the
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
this daycare worker was engaged in
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment of very young
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
children ages three and four you heard
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
some of the conduct that wasn't involved
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh also involved was uh physical
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
restraint bear hugging
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
um yelling
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
um some pretty bad things at these
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
children uh and grabbing and pulling
 
00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:36.970 align:start position:0%
children uh and grabbing and pulling
forcefully

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:36.980 align:start position:0%
forcefully
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
co-workers at the daycare knew this was
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
happening and were reporting it to the
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
administration at the daycare the
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
daycare and also child care licensing
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
was of the mind that this is not
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
reportable physical abuse I don't know
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
how that's possible but that is how this
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
is conduct now is being interpreted
 
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:02.180 align:start position:0%
um it took a co-worker
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
self-reporting to child care licensing
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
for child care licensing to get involved
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
um and no doubt while I don't know the
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
exact circumstances this was just simply
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
they were fed up and something needed to
 
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
they were fed up and something needed to
happen

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
um what then ensued was an investigation
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator was found to have
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
committed corporal punishment on several
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
children several times a week for over a
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
year the person was terminated obviously
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
however the daycare did not have any
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
finding that they failed to report
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
because child care licensing says this
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
is not reportable abuse
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment to you know the the 170 E4
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
it makes it very clear this is
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
reportable abuse frankly everyone I've
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
spoken to about this is shocked this is
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
not the law already
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
um the the other piece to this too is
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
that poor families like the more sets
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
don't have to be in the dark about
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um you know they were taking their child
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
to occupational therapy they didn't know
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
what was happening because nothing was
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
being reported this was allowed to
 
00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:19.789 align:start position:0%
being reported this was allowed to
Fester

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
Fester
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
um and this fixes that the the other
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
piece and there's another attorney who
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
practices criminal law um so I'll just
 
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.909 align:start position:0%
practices criminal law um so I'll just
generally

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
um go over it is uh that the the person
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
involved was not prosecuted because
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
there's another loophole in the the
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
criminal law that permits this sort of
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
conduct uh and the amendment to
 
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.570 align:start position:0%
conduct uh and the amendment to
um

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:46.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:49.460 align:start position:0%
uh where is it
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
62761 is designed to fix that now the
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
the piece to that that's important too
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
is if the person is prosecuted then they
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
will end up on the central registry if
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
they try to go work for another daycare
 
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
um their name will come up and that it
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
won't happen right now this person uh
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to name names but the
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
person involved uh I I believe works at
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
another facility with vulnerable
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
populations and there's no way for that
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
employer to have known what this person
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
did so it's just not right
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
um this legislation just simply puts the
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
law where it should be anyway closes
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
these loopholes and removes a safe
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
harbor uh for folks committing corporal
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
punishment on young children and I'm
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:39.500 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Grossman
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
coming before us
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
um what is the actual definition of
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment by the department So
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
currently it is defined as the
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
intentional infliction of physical pain
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
by any means for the purpose of
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
punishment correction discipline or any
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
other reason and I'll add to we did
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
propose in the statute to just include
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the definition of corporal punishment as
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
um in the child care licensing
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
regulations because that'll be easier
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
for child care facilities to implement
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
it there's no new rule they have to know
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
or apply because they should already be
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know aware of what the definitions
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
and regulations are in child care
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
licensing roles thank you
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh the uh physical
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
physical pain does that include
 
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.090 align:start position:0%
physical pain does that include
humiliation

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
humiliation
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
or or scaring a child
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
it does say the intentional infliction
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
of physical pain by any means for the
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
purpose of punishment
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not I'm not sure if that would
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
fit that definition so perhaps that
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
definition needs to be tweaked as well
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
and and uh follow up on me by the way uh
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
the follow-up is on um who If This Were
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
and there was a violation
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
where would that name go that would it
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
would it go to the daycare licensing you
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
know so that
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
a person going for another job uh would
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
be flacked how would somebody know
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
that this person has had violated
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
correct um yes so it the way that the
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
the two pieces to this amendment goes
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
that there is a criminal component so in
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
this case involving
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
um the morissets the person who was
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
um committing this the the police
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't prosecute because they felt
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
that this person had a defense so it
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't prosecuted so if the the second
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
piece the
 
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.730 align:start position:0%
piece the
um

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:57.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
under 627 6 is passed then what that
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
would do is the person would then go
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
through the criminal justice system and
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
if they are committed you know convicted
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
of having committed this act against the
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
child then that person ends up on the
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
central registry which would then come
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
up then if someone tries to go
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
um and apply for another job
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
correct that would show up okay great
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and in addition if this comes
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
under 170 e 12 1 then the injunctive
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
relief section 22 kicks in
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
so an individual May Institute any in
 
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:42.740 align:start position:0%
any Court of competent jurisdiction
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
injunction relief so it's even broader
 
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.049 align:start position:0%
injunction relief so it's even broader
than

00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
oh you're with that statutory section I
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me but it is
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
referenced at the end of Roman 2 in the
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill before us and I'm I'm just pointing
 
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:00.740 align:start position:0%
out that um the teeth that are put into
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh 170 E12 carry through
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
would you believe I I would have to take
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
a look at this
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
data statutory language there's another
 
00:22:11.159 --> 00:22:12.230 align:start position:0%
data statutory language there's another
attorney

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I have it right here and anyway thank
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify and support
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 206. my office is in
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
support as you heard prior in some of
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
the testimony that some of these
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
families have come to my office's
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
attention they have come to us seeking
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
assistance on these issues my office has
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
looked into the laws that exist
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
currently and we found a major Gap in
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
the system and we are speaking about
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of our most vulnerable children in
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
the state who don't have the ability to
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
come home and report to their parents
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
what is going on in these Child Care
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
Centers it's extremely worrying to
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
myself and to my office we did
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
immediately engage with the oversight
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
Commission on children's services to
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that they were aware of this Gap
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
in the system and as you see Senator
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
Carson brought this bill forward today
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
so I am in support I I'm very worried
 
00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:31.490 align:start position:0%
so I am in support I I'm very worried
about

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
what currently is happening in child
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
care facilities you heard from one
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
family my office has heard from more
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
than one it's not this is not this one
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
family's anomaly this is happening more
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
than we would expect and would hope in
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
our state and as they had mentioned in
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
in some of the cases that we have looked
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
into some of these providers have then
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
left the facility which they were
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
working for some have been fired by
 
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
higher ups in in the the child care
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
agency but then have transitioned to
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
another facility so the families are
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
able to track that confirm that and when
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
we look into it we have confirmed that
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
as well so they continue to work in this
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
realm although they're not working with
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
the same specific children so that just
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
stretches the reach of their harm for
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
children it's not just the you know
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
handful of children they first had
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
access to they're now broadening their
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
reach across the state
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
this is very problematic too to my
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
office and so and unfortunately in these
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
cases just given the way the law
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
currently exists there was minimal
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
support we were able to provide to these
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
families we were able to educate them on
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
the law that currently exists we were
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
able to send them to child care
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
licensing and the reports back that my
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
office would receive is that child care
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
licensing could not move forward with
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
much more than looking into the
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
allegations and Reporting back to the
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
heads of the Child Care Agency for what
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
they would have found it did not move
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
forward with the legal process it did
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
not move forward with a dcyf
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
investigations currently special
 
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:55.700 align:start position:0%
investigations for dcyf specifically has
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
the investigation authority over
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
residential facilities not education
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
um so as I had mentioned I am here in
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
support I I think it's critical that we
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
take the stand and and fill this Gap in
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
our law to protect the youngest children
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and to ensure that these providers
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
then cannot move to another facility and
 
00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299 align:start position:0%
continue to abuse children I do want to
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
address the question by representative
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
long and taking a look at the emotional
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
and psychological abuse and in my
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of corporal punishment
 
00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:32.299 align:start position:0%
that does not fall into
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment so that is an area
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
in which I just feel we still have a gap
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
and may may be worthwhile taking a look
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
at this bill if there's a way to
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
incorporate that piece because as we
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
understand the psychological impact can
 
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
have lasting effects on a child's mental
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
health and well-being
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
and thank you I'm open to any questions
 
00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:53.059 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that uh in a child care
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
setting it is the responsibility of the
 
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.769 align:start position:0%
setting it is the responsibility of the
adult

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
adult
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
to create a calm
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
controlled atmosphere yes it is follow
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
if an adult gets to a point where they
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
are striking out verbally or physically
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
isn't that a person who is out of
 
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.710 align:start position:0%
isn't that a person who is out of
control

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.810 align:start position:0%
control
yes

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman and thank
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
you for asking uh taking my question
 
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
you for asking uh taking my question
um

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
what is the average amount of complaints
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
per year that you know of
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
on the average for the specific issue
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
yes I only track the amount of
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
complaints that come into my office for
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
different issues I don't track what
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
child care licensing gets so this would
 
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:06.740 align:start position:0%
be the families that just find my office
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
over the past year we had five
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
complaints for this issue out of 319.
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.909 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
chairman

00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill that's in front of
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
us right now
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
and your commentary which is appreciated
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
which takes place after the fact versus
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
before the fact and that is what's to be
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
promulgated into law
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
right now it's referring uh in the bill
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
and you've read the full Bill yes I have
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
the bill before me on the line 17 where
 
00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:44.299 align:start position:0%
it says a physical Force by persons with
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
my words quotes special responsibilities
 
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.289 align:start position:0%
my words quotes special responsibilities
unquote

00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding and my belief is that
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
the special responsibilities is that
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
they are tasked with the care of very
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
young young and vulnerable children
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.269 align:start position:0%
follow up
uh

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
look I have a second question but uh so
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's not dealing with those with special
 
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.149 align:start position:0%
it's not dealing with those with special
needs

00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
no and not be specific to just children
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
with special needs it would include all
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
children that would attend Child Care
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
settings okay now next question then for
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
you is and within the bill itself
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
where it says the the
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
um the extent that such contact does not
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
violate child care licensing rules that
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
are already in and not going to have
 
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
that in front of me here for those
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
searching for it on the 541 and 170. is
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
the definition of corporal punishment
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
being what it is right now
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
do we need and that's for the safety of
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
parents making the right decision of
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
where they send their children but also
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
those providing the services
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
should there not be within the law a
 
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.149 align:start position:0%
should there not be within the law a
specific

00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
description of what is allowed or not
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
allowed in terms of
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
physical contact when it when it's
 
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.630 align:start position:0%
physical contact when it when it's
stating

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
stating
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
in here it's for these so-called safety
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
of the individual I would not recommend
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
special language specific to what
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
contact can and cannot be allowed I do
 
00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:18.419 align:start position:0%
believe adding the definition of
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment would cover that
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
concern okay then final follow-up is
 
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.100 align:start position:0%
last year on Hospital 427 we had our
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
various student research resource
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
provide for us
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
where that passed a uh it was a
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
definition of what that is and is that
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
definition not applicable or or by
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
applicable is it appropriate now or does
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
that need to be further enhanced with
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
further specific language
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
I believe that that covers the aspect of
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment in in regards to the
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
physical aspect the physical touch but I
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
believe the Missing Link at this point
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be including that psychological
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
and emotional impact to the child that
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
is what the definition would be missing
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Snapchat thank you
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman so I'm
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
looking at 161 14 2C
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it says corporal punishment means
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
any punishment in which physical force
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
is issued and intended to cause some
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
degree of pain or discomfort
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
so would discomfort be fear humiliation
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so no all right so a
 
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:35.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone thank you Mr
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you again for taking
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
another question from me um do you feel
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
that this particular Bill uh which
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully will become law uh would be
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
better if we included emotional and
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
psychological pain
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be stronger to
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
support the children because when we're
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
speaking about as we heard the mother
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
speak prior which is talking about the
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
yelling and the screaming at the
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
children that has as great of an impact
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
as physical harm to a child especially
 
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
when it's a caregiver who so this this
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
person is acting in the caregiver role
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
as as a parent would in the parents
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
absence absence during the day and
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
parents have a bonded relationship with
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
their child they have that healthy
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
attachment and so if there is yelling in
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
a household There's an opportunity for
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
repair as a parent comes back around
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
hugs their child laughs with them later
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
in the day and it has less of an
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
emotional impact
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a caregiver in the
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
setting who is acting in this way and if
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
they do not take the steps necessary for
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
the repair the damage of that emotional
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
trauma is as as damaging as physical
 
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
trauma is as as damaging as physical
abuse

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
oh so it's true that sticks and stones
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
can break your bones but words can break
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
your heart
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
that is true thank you let me ask a
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
question in order for us to work on this
 
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.730 align:start position:0%
question in order for us to work on this
bill

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
to add emotional distress to the child
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
I can see this probably have to be
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
retained and worked on and not come back
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
um that's just my guess
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
if we were to amend this then it would
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the Senate I have to
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
bounce around I'm seeing in line nine of
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
the bill endangerment shall also include
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment as defined by the
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
department in your professional opinion
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
do you think the department could
 
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.020 align:start position:0%
stretch that definition
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
while we then work on a new build for
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
next year that further qualifies it
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
would guarantee then my opinion this
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
Bill gets signed into law soon whereas
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
are working on this and then bouncing it
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
back and forth May delay it would that
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
be something you think the department
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
might be able to do
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
I I believe I I don't know for I can't
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
speak for sure if they would be willing
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
to do it but I do believe they
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
um could have an easier time to stretch
 
00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
um could have an easier time to stretch
that

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
um than working on this I will say that
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
if that one aspect could keep this bill
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
from passing this session then that is
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
something that I could take a step back
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
on and it's about the ensuring the
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
protections of the children now so if
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
that had to be added on later if it has
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be looking at it from the Department
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
scope I would be comfortable with that
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
as long as a bill can move forward to
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
protect children right now
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest to those who are
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
listening a should that be the course we
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
go start working on that bill for next
 
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:00.260 align:start position:0%
year yes thank you any other questions
 
00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
of The Advocates
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
and now I'm gonna I'm gonna take a stab
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Anthony scalabrini
 
00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:25.010 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Anthony scalabrini
yes

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.810 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
my name is Anthony scalabrini I'm a
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer in Nashua I've been practicing
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
for almost 20 years I do mostly criminal
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
work when Molly called my office and
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
asked me you know what's going on it
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
sent me on a research frenzy and only
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
then did I figure out that there was a
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
gap in the criminal code specifically
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
RSA 6276 paragraph two subparagraph B
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the uh part of the
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
criminal code that talks about the
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
defense for people with special
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to answer a previous
 
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:00.500 align:start position:0%
question special special
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is generally defined as
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
people that have some sort of
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
supervisory role over people that are in
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
need of help or children so it could be
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know somebody that works at a
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
daycare like here it could be a teacher
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
it could be somebody that works at a
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
group home those are the kinds of people
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
the statute and visions and it's really
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
important to note and this was brought
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
up by uh somebody about the definition
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
of corporal punishment the definition of
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment that this bill seeks
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
to incorporate is the one that's found
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the child care licensing regulations
 
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:34.700 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
4002.01 in sub uh paragraph zero or
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
paragraph o letter O and that one talks
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
about infliction of pain the question
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
about whether emotional harm would comp
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
come into that definition it seems
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
pretty clear looking at how the criminal
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
code and how the civil code have defined
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
infliction of pain physical pain that it
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and if you look at something
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
like the case law surrounding
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
intentional or negligent infliction of
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
emotional distress the court and the
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
common law make a pretty good bright
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
line distinction between physical pain
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
and emotional pain and so that that's
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
something that this this bill if it was
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
made into law could look at in terms of
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
defining the scope of what counts as
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment the one thing that I
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
I want to bring to the committee's
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
attention is this that often times there
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
is a perfect solution but that solution
 
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.450 align:start position:0%
is a perfect solution but that solution
is

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
in the offing it'd be better to put in
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
the solution that's before the committee
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
today to Institute some sort of
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
protection and then come back later and
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
fix it or add to it and it's especially
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
important here because emotional abuse
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
as you can see in the case law around
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
infl uh infliction of emotional distress
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
is very difficult to define the common
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
law around an infliction of distress
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
type torts has been modified and changed
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
and expanded pretty regularly over the
 
00:36:59.890 --> 00:36:59.900 align:start position:0%
past Century and in fact New Hampshire
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
relatively recently compared to other
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
states changed the sort of blast zone or
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
radius of harm for somebody and an
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
infliction of emotional damage case so
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
that case law is not something that
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
could be incorporated into a statute
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
with an easy fix whereas referencing a
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
pre-existing definition is really easy
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
and in the Senate somebody brought up
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
the point about does this change with
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
the child care providers have to do
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
because it's already part of the
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
regulation they're abiding by it doesn't
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
change anything they have to do it makes
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
clear that corporal punishment is a
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
crime again going back to the defense
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
with people with special
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities there was a question
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
about injunctive relief on RSA 170 E46 I
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
do believe that this is the exact kind
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
of thing that could be used to get into
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
court in an emergency basis to stop some
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
kind of harm the the last another
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
question that was asked was where would
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
they be listed so specifically the if
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're convicted of a crime you're
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
entered into the ncic database and this
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
would be something that anybody who does
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
a general background check could find if
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
you go to the Department of Safety today
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
and you pay 25 you can get your record
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
you most people have to sign something
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
allowing them to get your record when
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
you apply for a job so they can do a
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
background check it would be very easy
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's done every day it's not complicated
 
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.650 align:start position:0%
it's done every day it's not complicated
um

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of a specific list somebody
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
brought up a specific list I I tend to
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
agree with the office of the child
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
advocate that making a specific list
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
would give us places where we introduced
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
new gaps or new loopholes so instead of
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
doing that leave it as a broad
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
definition one that's already in the
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory code one that's already been
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
tested and worked on by people in the
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
field by people that do this kind of
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
work and understand what it is to
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
inflict uh emotion physical pain on
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
somebody as opposed to emotional pain so
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
as it is right now I think that that a
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
list would only introduce the
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
possibility for more problems I'm
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
strongly in support of this bill hearing
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
Molly talk every time makes me really
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
proud that we live in a country where
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
people like Molly can come forward and
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
make an impact and change the law and I
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to support this bill
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
and pass it counselor would you take
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
questions yes sir under 627 6 the 627 is
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
of course the chapter on justification
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in that chapter that
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
specifically says what we mean by
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
special responsibilities is however the
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
chapter starts by saying a parent
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
guardian or other person responsible for
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
the general care and Welfare of a minor
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot to me that is a definition
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
would you agree yes in fact that's how
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
the the rules of the Cannons of
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
construction work in interpreting
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
legislative uh and statutory edicts and
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%

179

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
179
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot to introduce relative to
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
eliminating the use of seclusion as a
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
form of punishment or discipline on
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
children in schools and treatment
 
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.530 align:start position:0%
children in schools and treatment

facilities
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
as amended this bill clarifies the
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of eliminating
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
seclusion the involuntary solitary
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
confinement of a child without any
 
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.349 align:start position:0%
confinement of a child without any
ambiguity

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
ambiguity
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
to be strictly prohibited I draw your
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
attention to section one where the
 
00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:51.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
seclusion shall never be used explicitly
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
or implicitly as punishment or
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
discipline for the behavior of a child
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement can cause extreme
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
psychological physical and developmental
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
harm for children who are still
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
developing and more vulnerable to
 
00:50:16.569 --> 00:50:16.579 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm the risks are magnified
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
particularly for kids with disabilities
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
or histories of trauma and abuse the
 
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission on children's
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
services has heard reports from the
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate that
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
facilities with State contracts are
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
using the ambiguity of current statute
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
to skirt the intent and are using what
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
is called in one facility a quiet room
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
as a form of discipline and Punishment
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the use of isolation as a disciplinary
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
measure risks damaging children's mental
 
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
health and can have the opposite of
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
intended infect by making behavioral
 
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
problems worse
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
preventative and positive behavioral

strategies that acknowledge the

struggles and triggers for children who
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
are already challenged is a more
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
effective and dare I say humane way of
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
offering interventions
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has made a commitment to
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
the multi-tiered system of support and
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
this committee has probably heard mtss
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
many times over as our framework for
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
enhancing the implementation of
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
way to reach them when they are in an
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
escalated state is best practices in

incidents in facilities working with
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
children is quite frankly all over the
 
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:09.260 align:start position:0%
place there is no uniformity of language
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
or reporting resulting in chaos of
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
interpretations and I draw your
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
attention to the packet that you've
 
00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.770 align:start position:0%
attention to the packet that you've
received

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%

00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
in order to establish a rubric for
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
uniform best practices Statewide
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
this Senate bill as amended will engage
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education the

and data in child protection
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
provided for the committee again as I
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
referenced is a packet of various
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
incident report forms currently used by
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
agencies all across the state while the
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
department of children youth and
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
families has provided an incident report
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
checklist the uniformity in reporting
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
ends right there
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the packet provided for you there's a
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
and the family services reporting form
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom of the page there are
 
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:25.910 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom of the page there are
options

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
for the staff
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
to check off and you check off the use
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
of techniques that were used
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
in managing a child
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
one is called the one arm wrap
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's also the Sunday stroll
 
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:46.940 align:start position:0%
the one person vertical immobilization
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the double Sunday stroll
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
these would sound more familiar in a WWE
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
ring those terms are not used on any
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
other reporting forms the second page
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
has spots for a reporting having
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
directed a student to a quiet area or
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
the use of seclusion in response to high
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
level Behavior clearly there is a need
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
for some uniform language across all of
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
our facilities with State contracts and
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
clarification in this proposal of the
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
words shall never
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
from may not be in rsa126u5
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
I asked the committee to affirm the
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
Senate position and recommend Senate
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 179 as amended ought to pass thank
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman will you take
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
questions and your former committee I
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
would be delighted representative
 
00:54:42.119 --> 00:54:43.730 align:start position:0%
would be delighted representative
Petrino

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
Petrino
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
Senator I just want to thank you for
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward when I was a
 
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
nursery school child I was frequently
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
secluded in the classroom closet for
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
apparently not participating accordingly
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
but really what I struggled with was
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities which people did
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
not know at the time so this one speaks
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
to me on a very personal level and it
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
did impact me adversely throughout my
 
00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
Elementary School experience so I just
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank you so much for bringing
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
this forward thank you I'm very sorry
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
um similar to a several percent of
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
Petrino this is bringing uh
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
really ugly memories being punished and
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
being hit with a ruler
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh yeah I I don't want to see any
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
child being hit by with a ruler or um a
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
sewing machine Bell because that's not
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
how kids should be punished especially
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
in that environment
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this up thank you
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
bringing this to us
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
um my question is regarding
 
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
um the use of some of the calm down
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
spaces that we see in elementary schools
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
and occasionally in a residential
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
facility I know in Nashua for example
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
one of our elementary schools has a room
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a sensory room and they
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
have different stations that a student
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
may progress through on an individual
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
basis uh with you know there's like
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
stress balls and there's some other
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
stuff do you see this legislation as
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
interfering with that kind of
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic space or simply being aimed
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
at the you know the empty padded rooms
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we see sometimes as well
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you very
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
much for offering an opportunity for
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
this clarification
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
um so what you are seeing in that Nashua
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
School when a child has to is removed
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
from a classroom for
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
um as you said maybe a calm down space
 
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
bringing them into a sensory room where
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
there is supervision from
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
um from an adult from a teacher from a
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
trusted trusted adult is all part of
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
what we have already made a commitment
 
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:16.700 align:start position:0%
to as best practice in New Hampshire of
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
mtss that's identifying prior to there
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
being a meltdown if you will who that
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
child responds best to in the crisis and
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
what are the ways that that child is
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
most supported in the calming down so we
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
can get back to regular school and
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
learning quicker
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
so this does not apply in the way that
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
we teach in our elementary middle and
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
high schools right now because we have
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
established those systems of support
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
they are not being used as a form of
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
discipline or punishment they're
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
actually being used as a way of building
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
resilience and keeping that child and
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
the other children safe
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
what this bill addresses is that also in
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
your hometown we do have a state agency
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
we have a contract with an agency that
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
actually uses a solitary room there are
 
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:17.660 align:start position:0%
no sensory
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
there are no sensory guides there is no
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
one sitting with that child there is
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
that child is alone in a room
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
four hours and we have reports at the
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
commission for their children the
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
oversight of Children's Services of days
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
and that child being children having
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
been paraded out of those spaces to eat
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
in solitary alone in a cafeteria and
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
then per and then walked back into that
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
space as a form of coercive control for
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
the other students that if you don't
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
want this to happen to you
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
then you will get in line now none of
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
that addresses any kind of trauma it
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
brings on more none of that addresses
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
any kind of Behavioral issues that that
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
child may be having related to their
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
trauma it makes more so children who are
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
in facilities with State contracts
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
are already traumatized they're not home
 
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
they're not with family they couldn't be
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
there and we need to address those
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
issues so taking a child out of their
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
environment for the health and safety of
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
that child and the other children is a
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
very different
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
method of building resilience and
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
supporting that child then putting them
 
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339 align:start position:0%
into solitary confinement
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
that's a representative ball
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
Harrison and thank you for being here
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious how does this impact
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
um in school suspensions where the
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
children are sometimes or at least when
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
I taught years ago
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
um the children were often kept away
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
from their other peers not necessarily
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
in a separate room but maybe part of an
 
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
office but they were not allowed to
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
interact with their peers so how does
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
this impact that in-house
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
those children who are in a school that
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
the school may be using that that type
 
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.950 align:start position:0%
the school may be using that that type
of

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
discipline and behavior control are not
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
leaving the children in a locked room or
 
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.270 align:start position:0%
leaving the children in a locked room or
um

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
keeping them confined
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
for hours and hours and hours upon time
 
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:47.450 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Grossman

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
Grossman
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and welcome back
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you for being here and
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
can you explain for us what
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
um there are some suggestions in this
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill as to how seclusion should be
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
handled on the last on page two
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
there are some suggestions of a
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
co-regulator a through d
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
can you just describe what is being
 
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
suggested for school districts to do
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
instead because they are required you
 
01:01:25.329 --> 01:01:25.339 align:start position:0%
are asking for
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
adult staff member a trusted adult just
 
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
so the committee can understand what is
 
01:01:33.849 --> 01:01:33.859 align:start position:0%
being expected if seclusion thank you
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Grossman I
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you offering me the
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:43.579 align:start position:0%
point out that on page two Section 3
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
the a through D actually describes what
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
we are using in New Hampshire right now
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
which is mtss a multi-tiered system of
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
support which is to identify prior to an
 
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:02.900 align:start position:0%
incident a plan so as as highlighted
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
develop a plan to help the child manage
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
their state of Regulation and then
 
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
return to a less restrictive setting so
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
a child that does leave the classroom to
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
go to a sensory room
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're not putting them we're not just
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
putting them in a sensory room and you
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
know hoping they might
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
stop spinning we have a plan in place
 
01:02:24.359 --> 01:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
stop spinning we have a plan in place
for

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
um because we have we observed this
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
behavior before perhaps and and we have
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
a multi-tiered system support so we know
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
how that child best responds when they
 
01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
are in a heightened state so that may be
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in you know if they have a very
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
good relationship with the nurse and
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're having a crisis in this moment
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
then that teacher would call for the
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
nurse to come in and have a conversation
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
with that child and understand that
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
these type of incidents in school
 
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.349 align:start position:0%
these type of incidents in school
settings

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
settings
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
are quick they don't last the entire
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
school day so we have mtss being
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
implemented in school settings what we
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
don't have is the same type of system
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
instituted in places where children live
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
and are being cared for under State
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
contracts so
 
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.530 align:start position:0%
contracts so
um

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
that is so mtss is what's outlined in
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
that space right there and I just wanted
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
to also address
 
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:27.890 align:start position:0%
to also address
um

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
I missed a spot with representative
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
Ball's question and I would just like to
 
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
point out
 
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.890 align:start position:0%
point out
um

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
that in section three on the first page
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
seclusion shall not be used in a manner
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that unnecessarily subjects the child to
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
the risk of ridicule humiliation or
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
emotional or physical harm so an
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
after-school detention in the study hall
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
would be very different than putting all
 
01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
of the students who had a detention that
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon in the front hall to be
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
observed by their peers as their peers
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
leave for the day so that would be in it
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
that would be an intentional humiliation
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
versus a consequence of behaviors where
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to stay after
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
school and do your homework in a
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
supervised setting
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification thank
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
you I know that when I taught they were
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
very much against the intentions but we
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
used a system called lost time so that
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
gave the child time to stay after it
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
without it being a bad thing we actually
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
told the parents this is a good thing
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
because the child can now do their work
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they stay up and
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't fall into a pattern of now they're
 
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
frustrated so thank you for clarifying
 
01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
chairman and it's nice to see you again
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
Senator hello hi uh I just had one quick
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
question on page two under Roman numeral
 
01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
three on lines three and four
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
um the co-regulator shall check the
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
child at regular intervals not to exceed
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
30 minutes between any one interval
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
um how is that a 30-minute period of
 
01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
um how is that a 30-minute period of
time

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
um determined that was done in
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the office of the
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
child advocate and with other Advocates
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
who use mtss
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and they're um I think
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
there may be yes she's here so I I
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:40.980 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes from new Futures Emma
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
and I would ask that each person who
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
signed a pink card uh
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
observed what they wrote on the pink
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
card meaning you need two to three
 
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:00.980 align:start position:0%
minutes because we're up against
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
other bills coming before us so
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
hello good morning thank you for having
 
01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
hello good morning thank you for having
me

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
um I believe my handouts already made it
 
01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.370 align:start position:0%
um I believe my handouts already made it
around

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
um my name is Emma savini I am the

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters new Futures is here in
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
support of Senate bills 179 because
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
seclusion is an inappropriate
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
traumatizing and Dangerous Method for
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
discipline and should be never should
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
never be used as punishment for children
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
as you heard from the bill sponsor
 
01:06:38.049 --> 01:06:38.059 align:start position:0%
seclusion can create
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
psychological and physical harm and in
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
some cases even result in death through
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
children being placed in seclusion and
 
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:48.380 align:start position:0%
then escalating to forms of restraint
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
which can result in death
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has already recognized the
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
importance of banning this practice by
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
passing this law way back in the day and
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
now is just kind of tidying up the
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
language as you've heard it's just
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
closing that Gap by changing the May to
 
01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and instead what this bill does is
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
encourage therapeutic practices to be
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
utilized instead so as you discussed the
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
co-regulator method is a great way to
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
help children have positive behavior
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
interventions and those have actually
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
been shown to have a better impact on
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
behavior and a more lasting positive
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
um I just would also like to highlight
 
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:36.980 align:start position:0%
for you that seclusion is
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
disproportionately used on children with
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
learning and behavioral disabilities and
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
with Children of color you'll see some
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
statistics in my written testimony but I
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
think that this uh change in statute
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be an excellent way for New
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to come forward and be a
 
01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
leader for our country and eliminating
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
seclusion and taking a step towards
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
um being a more welcoming and Equitable
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
environment for all Granite State
 
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.329 align:start position:0%
environment for all Granite State
children

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:02.339 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass this bill
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
hello Mr vigney thank you for being here
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of the lawsuit to
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
come I want to ask uh your clarification
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
or your guidance on this in the bill uh
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
line four
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
and then line five where it says that
 
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
you just indicated uh seclusion shall
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
never be used then in the next line it
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
says it may only be used so we have an
 
01:08:35.169 --> 01:08:35.179 align:start position:0%
inherent contradiction in the narrative
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
my question to you is should that second
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
line be miss a none miss you eliminated
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
or Rewritten
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
um so I will give my opinion but I think
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
that question is better answered by some
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
of the folks who have done the actual
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
work uh writing this bill
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
um I think that that carve out is
 
01:08:59.450 --> 01:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
specifically for those instances in
 
01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.709 align:start position:0%
specifically for those instances in
which

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
um you know seclusion can be used in a
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
safe and effective way uh like the
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
detention we talked about or the
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
in-school suspension where it's not a
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
traumatic event for the child and there
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
are other adults in the room to who can
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
help co-regulate in those those types of
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
specific situations so there is a carve
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
out as you'll see in that second line
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
where it says it may only be used
 
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.650 align:start position:0%
where it says it may only be used
um

01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
so but again I encourage you to ask that
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
question to those who may be better
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
suited to answer
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
I just wouldn't follow up then follow up
 
01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:35.510 align:start position:0%
I just wouldn't follow up then follow up
again

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
dealing in word meaning which
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
always sets the standard for what
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
happens next is that uh
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the word never should that be would you
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
suggest uh that that be removed and say
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
shall not be used versus shall never be
 
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.830 align:start position:0%
shall not be used versus shall never be
used

01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.010 align:start position:0%
used
um

01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:58.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
again I'll defer I I would encourage you
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
to ask that question to
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
um some other folks who may be better
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
suited uh the child advocate or
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
um the attorneys in the disability
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
rights Center who may be able to better
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
answer that all right thank you ma'am
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
um with regard to that I'm just
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
wondering I know I will ask the next
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
person as well but maybe you can answer
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is the prob is the challenge here
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
using the word discipline
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
because as a behaviorist a discipline
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
gives to the child where punishment
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
takes away so typically we want to
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
discipline children not through Corporal
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
punishmentary but by giving them more
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
time giving them more space giving them
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
more supports that's what technically
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
discipline is supposed to do and so I'm
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
just wondering if it should just be will
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
because keeping a child in a
 
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
a sensory room that's really a
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
discipline because we are actually
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
giving them the space they need to learn
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
the self-regulation skills so there's in
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
the in that sense there's a big
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
difference between the two words and
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
maybe that's where there might need to
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
be a clarification is that possible
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I completely understand where you're
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
coming from and thank you for the
 
01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
question I um
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
I had not given that specific word that
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh meaning
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have a fully fleshed out
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
opinion on it and I'd have to do more
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
research before I could give you an
 
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.370 align:start position:0%
research before I could give you an
answer

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
um but I can absolutely look into that
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I'm Karen
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center like I'm not
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
very loud right now
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to testify in support of SB
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
179 on behalf of the disability rights
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
Center also some other organizations who
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here New Hampshire legal
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
assistance and Waypoint who I think is
 
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
here but I'll my testimony will be for
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe what I was hoping to do
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
is give sort of puts put a picture on
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
some of the kinds of
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
um incidents and things that we're
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
talking about that we see as loopholes
 
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
to our current law which limits the use
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
of seclusion but I also want to address
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon's questions about
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill so
 
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.030 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill so
um

01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
if that if that would be helpful and
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
please interrupt me with questions that
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
you might have so
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
I don't see the language as inconsistent
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
it actually mirrors current law as it is
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
now but strengthens our current law so
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
um So currently
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
as you can see when you look at the bill
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
um it we say seclusion may not be used
 
01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
as a form of punishment or discipline
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to explain when
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
seclusion may be used the reason for
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
this change is to make it to really
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
tighten it up and strengthen it so that
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
it mirrors the same prohibition that we
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
have the language we use in our
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
prohibition against the use of physical
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
restraint so if you look
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
further deeper into the statute I think
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's at u5 but let me just
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
get there
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
um no sorry yes
 
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.130 align:start position:0%
um no sorry yes
um

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
so our restraint law has language that
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
is similar in that it says it restraints
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
shall only be used in a score facility
 
01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
to ensure the immediate physical safety
 
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
so it explains when restraint may be
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
used further along in the statute
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
however it does explain that
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
um restraint shall not be shall never be
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
used explicitly or implicitly as
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
punishment and why am I not finding that
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
because probably it is happening earlier
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
um here we
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
page one section one okay
 
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:20.689 align:start position:0%
page one section one okay
um

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
you know I do that I look at this all
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
um basically it makes it very clear in
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
our law that restraint shall never be
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
used explicitly or implicitly as
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
punishment or discipline for the
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
behavior of a child and I oh it's and
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm looking at the statute I
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
know it is in here oh here it is um
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
you've yeah sorry about that
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
um it's no it's you've it is u5
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and and and essentially it's not
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
contradictory because we know it's it
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used for this purpose
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
here's when it should when it may be
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
used does that make sense
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
no I'm so sorry
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
um because I like I said I didn't know
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
that I was going to be exactly
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
addressing this
 
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.970 align:start position:0%
addressing this
ah

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
here it is I'm sorry it is it's in u5 so
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
our current law RSA 126 u5 Roman 2 says
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I read just exactly restraints shall
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
never be used explicitly or implicitly
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
as punishment for the behavior of a
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
child so the goal here and I apologize
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
for taking so long to get you all there
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that when we're talking
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
about seclusion and we are that the
 
01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:41.179 align:start position:0%
prohibition against the use of seclusion
 
01:15:44.689 --> 01:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
for punishment or discipline mirrors the
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
probe the language and the prohibition
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
for restraint the sentiment is the same
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be using these kinds
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
of restrictive Behavior techniques that
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
are really traumatizing on children for
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
discipline that's not what discipline is
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
discipline doesn't traumatize or
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
re-traumatize children what discipline
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
does is it tries to address behavior in
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
a way that will and enable the child to
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
understand that this Behavior not is not
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
just unexpected but behavior that they
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
should not be engaging in it may violate
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
a code of conduct for example it may be
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
putting other people at danger but it's
 
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
behavior that they need to learn how to
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
address and we address in different ways
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
in our schools and in our treatment
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
facilities so but one thing that is
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear is that we address this as
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
a learning opportunity we want we use
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
seclusion and restraint only when
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect other people from
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
physical harm that's why it's prohibited
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
we you know there are times when we
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
can't protect some another person or the
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
child without using this really you know
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
last minute emergency response but it
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
should not be used in response to
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
something like child is refusing to
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
clean up after themselves swearing at
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
someone littering
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
you know refusing the first directive to
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
come inside from the playground
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's where we discipline we don't
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
seclude for that so
 
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
is that clear as mud now or clear I hope
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you and just so you have an idea
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the kinds of things we see in our
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
office so we as the protection and
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
advocacy Agency for people with
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities we have special authority
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
to go into facilities to monitor for
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
people's safety interview folks who are
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
in those programs and this includes
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
children's facilities and so what we've
 
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
seen over the years is the that even
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
though the numbers of recorded reported
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
seclusions have really declined
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
radically particularly in facilities
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
that serve our children we're we're
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
hearing about ways that
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
um schools and facilities are kind of
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
like navigating around our law so for
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
example current law says it's not
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
seclusion if you drag a child into a
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
room shut the door tell them they cannot
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
leave or they know that if they leave
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
they'll be restrained as long as that
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
door is unlocked
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
right so children no they've learned
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
don't open that door because either
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
they've seen another kid get restrained
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
after trying to open the door or they
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
know they'll lose privileges or they've
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
been basically you know like terrorized
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
to stay in the room
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
the experience for the child is exactly
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
the same but our law currently says well
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
if that door is unlocked that's not
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
seclusion then it's not reportable it
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
can be used for any kind of behavior
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
you're subjecting the kiddo to the same
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
kind of circumstance and we've seen
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
these kind of situations go on for hours
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
and hours at end which is really
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
traumatic for the kid and what are they
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
learning in those hours that they're
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
basically being Behind Closed Doors by
 
01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
basically being Behind Closed Doors by
themselves

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
so it it seeks to tighten that up and
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
then the other thing that we've seen and
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because we've seen
 
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
facilities do this well and we've seen
 
01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
them do it poorly is basically dragging
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
a kid out of their program putting them
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
in a room that might be called a quiet
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
room or a contemplation area or some
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
other euphemism and they might be able
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
to staff member but the staff is
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
blocking the door not engaging with the
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
child and in some cases we've gotten
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
reports that kids are actually like the
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
staff when the child tries to engage
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
with them they're demeaning them they're
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
like criticizing them they're saying
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
mean things about their family about the
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
child you know it's not a therapeutic
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
intervention yet we've also seen
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
facilities that we've in that we've
 
01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
facilities that we've in that we've
monitored

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
monitored
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
have kids where they actually recognize
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
when the child's behavior is getting a
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
bit out of control they've worked with
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
the child to help them recognize this
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
themselves they have a separate space
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
that a child can go to that's sort of
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
like a happy calming space and they have
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
staff in there that use a behavior plan
 
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
to work with the child for kids with
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
autism we've seen rooms like this that
 
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
have like a swing it's kind of like a
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
hammock that they feel safe in and can
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
get some movement and calm down others
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
have like beanbag chairs and are kind of
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
cozy where kids can voluntarily take
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
advantage of an opportunity to learn a
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
skill the skill is no one to need no one
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
to ask for a break
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
and then be able to have someone on the
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
other side who's processing with you
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
like what happened so someone on the
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
other side working with the child to
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
help them figure out what happened and
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
then get them back in the classroom
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
some of these places will be monitored
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
that don't do that we've we've heard
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
from kids who have slept overnight how
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
dangerous are you when you're sleeping
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
overnight you know where's the present
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
danger there and you're separated from
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
your peers and you're in a separate
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
space that's hard walls nothing on them
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
and you're sleeping there overnight
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
because you swore at staff
 
01:20:42.179 --> 01:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
because you swore at staff
so

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm happy to take other questions
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
which hopefully I can answer more
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
eloquently than I did when I started
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative ball thank you chairman
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson hi good to see you again nice to
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
see you
 
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
um going back to when you read that
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
definition from the RSA I think it was
 
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.850 align:start position:0%
definition from the RSA I think it was
126u

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
126u
 
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
126u
I

01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
I didn't think I heard the word
 
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.830 align:start position:0%
I didn't think I heard the word
discipline

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
so because with the
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
restraint was the first thing that the
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
law prohibited right and then seclusion
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
was added so the the sections don't add
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
they they don't align perfectly well so
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the seclusion portion of the bill
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
they separate out those two features so
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
when you see like the restraint part
 
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
um restraints shall not be used
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
explicitly or implicitly as a punishment
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
for the behavior of the child just above
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
it it says restraints shall only be used
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
in a school or facility to ensure the
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
immediate physical safety of persons
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
when there is a substantial and imminent
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
risk of serious bodily harm so in with
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
the restraint they separate you know
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the same section but they broke
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
it into two they mean your predecessors
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
probably unless you're around then broke
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
it into two separate Roman numeral
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
paragraphs so I suppose you could break
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
it into two separate Roman numeral
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
paragraphs I I don't know that that's
 
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
necessary though to convey
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to convey here it's
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
just a different way that they wrote it
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're trying to mirror like that
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
definition but I thought you said
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
everything that is written without the
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
word discipline because I'm going back
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
to that idea that that discipline is
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
teaching all those skills so why would
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
we want to say we're going to
 
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.930 align:start position:0%
we want to say we're going to
um

01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
not use it I understand that we're then
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
turning around and saying we are going
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
to use it but I guess I'm just saying
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
why don't we just leave it as punishment
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
and take out the or discipline so
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
seclusion and seclusion and restraint
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
are emergency responses they're not
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
disciplined they're not punishment right
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's what they're like that's but what
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
we but we've received information that
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
suggests that some schools and
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
Facilities use it like as a threat or as
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
discipline and that's just inappropriate
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why our law has even since
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
2014 when we added the prohibition
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
against useless occlusion included
 
01:23:16.729 --> 01:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
language saying that it cannot be used
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
as punishment or discipline the only the
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
objective here was just to mirror the
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
language that we use in Restraint with
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
restraint to avoid confusion and make it
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
really if it wasn't clear before
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
this is not appropriately used as
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
it does
 
01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.350 align:start position:0%
it does
um

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
it does I guess I'm just stuck on that
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
word because it still implies to me that
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
that is a positive and um that what is a
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
positive discipline
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
is used I mean if those I guess my
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
concern is that I'm wondering if these
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
other facilities are using it wrong
 
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
they're not understanding the difference
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
between the two because clearly some of
 
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
the things they're doing is that is not
 
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
disciplineable that is punishment well
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
what the other what the facilities are
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
doing is not using seclusion because
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
what this bill says is that if you have
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
a child you're working on a plan with
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
them and they voluntarily go to like a
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
sensory room for example with staff
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's not seclusion
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
so those facilities are using this the
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
separation of the child in a way that's
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary to the child and it's done in
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic way
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
so and also what this bill would do is
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
say you know what even if you're not
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
sending the kid to a therapeutic
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
separate room but you're having them in
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
a room with another staff member and
 
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
it's just a separate room that as long
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
as that staff member is engaging there
 
01:24:53.169 --> 01:24:53.179 align:start position:0%
in a therapeutic manner with that child
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
that that would not be considered
 
01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.689 align:start position:0%
that that would not be considered
seclusion

01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
seclusion
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
so so the the reason that's important is
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
because it allows for the situation
 
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
where as Senator alschilder
 
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
intimated sometimes these are really
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
quick situations so if a child's
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
behavior is unexpected quickly quick out
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
a teacher can take the child out of the
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
room go in another room with them and
 
01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
then help them to process what's going
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
on and we're not going to call that
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
seclusion but if it's but what it seeks
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
to get at though is If instead the child
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
is removed to a separate room in a
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
facility and and there's nothing there
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
for the child and the person refuses to
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
interact with them and there is no
 
01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
Behavior plan or they demean them
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
because that's not therapeutic that
 
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
being here and explaining this so what
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I just want to make sure that I'm
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
understanding because I think there's
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
some confusion about the never used and
 
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
then may use so the only reason that
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're saying never is
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
because it's like that quick thing so
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're you're never able to just throw
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
the kid in a closet and walk away it has
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
to be explicitly or implicit has to be
 
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
used with something else so if there's
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
the immediate response we need to remove
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
them for just a minute let them cool
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
down but a staff is staying nearby
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
um because we're trying to prevent
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
somebody from just doing this and just
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
walking away or kind of locking them in
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and forgetting them is that correct is
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
that why the language reads that way but
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's also it's important to
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
read the next sentence absolutely right
 
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
because it says you know when you may
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
use it right because really this is an
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
emergency response right and that's and
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
and so the intent here is to make it
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
clear that it's to Define what seclusion
 
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
is and then which is and and Define what
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
that emergency response could could look
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
like and but make it clear that you know
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're limited to using this kind of
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
emergency response to certain situations
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
child poses a substantial and imminent
 
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
risk of physical harm to others perfect
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm still struggling
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
with the word never now according to the
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
definition of never it is that no time
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the past or future
 
01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
on no occasion not ever
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
so if you use the word never
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
in that first sentence and then go to
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
the next one and say but if you want to
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
I I'm struggling with that I I I just
 
01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:45.980 align:start position:0%
can't get it can you help my struggle
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'll try to help your struggle
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
like I said it's I mean one thing
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
you could do is reverse the order of
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
those sentences maybe that would help I
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
think those two sentences are still
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
there which basically lets you know that
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
seclusion may only be used similarly to
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
the the restraint though right the
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
restraint portion of this it's all in
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
the same section
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
um when it was drafted they just the
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you were here actually
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
um it was just separated out into two
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
separate paragraphs I think the the
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
outcome is basically the same however
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
um and I think the intent here was
 
01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639 align:start position:0%
um to really make it clear
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
using the same language that we use for
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
restraint it wasn't to make just it
 
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't it it was basically to make it
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
mirror that restraint language so that
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's abundantly clear there was a
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
feeling that seclusion the way it reads
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
now may not be used as a form of
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
punishment or discipline wasn't strong
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
enough language
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why it was put in but but if I
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
mean it could be just you could you
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
could just add a Roman and and switch
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
the order if that would be more
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
comfortable I would really like to move
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
this hearing along I'm looking at what's
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
on the books now in the book that it's
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
in and you can have a version of that by
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
looking at your bill and seeing the
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
strikeout right I think as lsrs in 2021
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
and I checked the supplements to make
 
01:29:12.179 --> 01:29:13.189 align:start position:0%
and I checked the supplements to make
sure

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
01:29:14.699 --> 01:29:15.709 align:start position:0%
etc etc
um

01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
it made sense because the word May
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
is is not a mandatory word it's a
 
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
permissive word I think if the first two
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
sentences were slightly reworded we
 
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
would solve this problem and we can move
 
01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
along yeah because everything else in
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
here I've been able to find on the books
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
already right that's the only change and
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
if our problem is with that only thing
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
right there I think a very simple little
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
obviously I would defer to the sponsor
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
but I think I think it personally if you
 
01:29:54.129 --> 01:29:54.139 align:start position:0%
want to just have a romance
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think it's a problem either
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
this is a great solution the non-pro
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much that resolves my
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
struggle thank you good thank you
 
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
grammatically correct it wasn't even in
 
01:30:07.729 --> 01:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
the book I got for Christmas that's why
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
we have to come over there thank you so
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
much everyone thank you counselor
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%

Grassroots organization whose mission is
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
to improve the lives of all people
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
impacted by mental illness and suicide
 
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
through support education and advocacy
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Nami New Hampshire I'm here
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
today in support of Senate Bill 179 as
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
um also just wanted to point out that
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
you know per Nami National we also adopt
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of their own policy positions but
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
we also believe that no one should be
 
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
subjected to practices that worsen
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
seclusion worsens mental health when it
 
01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:06.500 align:start position:0%
is used
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
inappropriately as a punishment or a
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
form of discipline when it's used to
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
keep people safe then that's a pro and
 
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
an appropriate use of seclusion I will
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
keep my remarks brief you've already
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
heard that this is trauma it causes
 
01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
trauma in the kids you have my written
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as a policy paper
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
um that came out from Nami National I
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
did email that to you because there's a
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot of hyperlinks in that that lead to
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
different researches research that's
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
been done on how this is trauma and I
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
but I did also want to go back to
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
the never and then going on further to
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:31:52.209 --> 01:31:52.219 align:start position:0%
never is qualified by
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
the punishment or discipline aspect of
 
01:31:55.199 --> 01:31:55.970 align:start position:0%
the punishment or discipline aspect of
it

01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
so if it's not being used as a
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
punishment or discipline then it is
 
01:32:00.179 --> 01:32:01.370 align:start position:0%
punishment or discipline then it is
permissible

01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
permissible
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
so the never is being qualified by those
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
two words at the end of the sentence
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
um and I just you know since you have
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony about this I
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
just wanted to recount you know my own
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
experience at Hampstead Hospital where I
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
worked for two years prior to going to
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
law school
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
and I worked with a lot with this little
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
boy who was much like a jumping bean and
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
every time we'd go downstairs to do
 
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
school he would start running from table
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
to table on the tops of them he would
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
run down the halls and I would have to
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
chase after him
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you there were times
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
that I became so frustrated I would have
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
loved to been able to put him in our
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
quiet room and say
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
block the door and this is where we're
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
due in school
 
01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
but that wasn't appropriate it wasn't
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate because he wasn't being
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:51.890 align:start position:0%
appropriate because he wasn't being
unsafe

01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
he knew how to jump from table to table
 
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:55.340 align:start position:0%
very safely
 
01:32:57.890 --> 01:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
so I just leave you with that that you
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
know there are situations where staff
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
get frustrated and it'd be much easier
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
for me to have been able to contain him
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
but it would have been very
 
01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.610 align:start position:0%
but it would have been very
inappropriate

01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
so um today Nami New Hampshire urges
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
this committee to take a strong look at
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
this bill if you have concerns about the
 
01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:17.540 align:start position:0%
language that you think need to be fixed
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the stakeholders here are
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
amendable to that but we do support the
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
Senate bill as amended and I will take
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have I'm going to
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
ask this question of all the lawyers
 
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.350 align:start position:0%
ask this question of all the lawyers
coming

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
do you see the bill as presented to us
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
propose any linguistic problems in the
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
juxtaposition of it may not be and it
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
may only be do you see any legal
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the bill as presented to
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
us no and the reason for that chairman
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
Pearson is because that first sentence
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
says shall never be used explicitly or
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
implicitly implicitly as punishment or
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
discipline so never is qualified by the
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
punishment and the discipline aspect of
 
01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.530 align:start position:0%
punishment and the discipline aspect of
that

01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%

01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
especially speak to that point I just
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the first two lines
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
lines four and five if there's any legal
 
01:34:24.179 --> 01:34:26.090 align:start position:0%
lines four and five if there's any legal
opinion

01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
um that are you a lawyer no then you can
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
skip that part okay thank you I get to

support of SB 179 for the record my name
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
is Kristen Evans and I am the director
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's only disability Justice
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
organization and we advocate for the
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%

adults with disability I will keep my
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
testimony brief you have my written
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of you it was passed
 
01:34:56.689 --> 01:34:56.699 align:start position:0%
out earlier I would like to express our
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
strong support for SB 179 as an
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
organization dedicated to advancing the
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
rights and dignity of individuals with
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities we believe that the use of
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
seclusion is harmful and inhumane
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
practice that must be banned research
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
has shown that seclusion is often used
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
disproportionately on children with
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities particularly those with
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
autism and other developmental disorders
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
according to a 2019 report by the
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
national disability rights Network
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities are
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
overrepresented in seclusion and
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
restraints include incidents in school
 
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
with one study finding that they
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
accounted for 71 percent of such
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
incidences the passage of SB 179 would
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
be a significant step towards promoting
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
the safety and well-being of children
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in schools and
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities we urge lawmakers
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
to support this important legislation
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
and prioritize the rights and dignity of
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
all children
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%

I'm a parent if that helps that
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%

01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
um my name is Tessa Smith I live in
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
Loudon New Hampshire I have two sons
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
that are 12 and 9 that are complete
 
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
opposites my older son loves sports and
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
my younger son loves to sing and dance
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
um this bill affects my family
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
especially my little Sour Patch kiddo
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
Nico because Nico has autism he attends
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
fourth grade at Loudoun Elementary in a
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
regular classroom but uses the quiet
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
room daily as we know now the quiet room
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
is also known as the seclusion room my
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
thought on what a quiet room was and
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
what I was mostly shown was and mostly
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
empty classroom with a couple chairs a
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
little bit of artwork on the
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
um on the walls unfortunately
 
01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.330 align:start position:0%
um on the walls unfortunately
um

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
that's not the case his quiet room is a
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
white padded room with gym pads on the
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
walls much like in an institution
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
um my son uses this room daily
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
the most recent use of this was this
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
past week on Wednesday when my
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
nine-year-old son was forced to spend
 
01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
hours guarded by his para who's
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
intimidating by the way but lovely until
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
he could calm down he was put in this
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
room for taking things off the teacher's
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
desk and gesturing a fist he couldn't
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
calm down enough in time to go home on
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
the school bus so they kept him there in
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
that quiet room until I could come get
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
him unfortunately that was also the day
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
where I didn't have my vehicle so I had
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
to call every single family member I
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
know and find a way for him to get home
 
01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:34.139 align:start position:0%
um thankfully my sister was only 25
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
minutes away and so he continued to
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
spend the rest of the day in that room
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
until she was able to pick him up
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill because having a
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
co-regular in the room with him which he
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
has someone check on him but for the
 
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
most part it's just guarded by the
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
parent in the room
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
um would allow him to be able to access
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
skills and coping mechanisms that he has
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
that he can't access himself obviously
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
with autism it's really hard to regulate
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
yourself so having someone in there and
 
01:38:04.729 --> 01:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
just checking on him at 30 minute
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
interval Max would be able to access
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
those skills and help him calm down to
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
their standard I do want to ask for some
 
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.129 align:start position:0%
their standard I do want to ask for some
clarification

01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
um in that first section under u5
 
01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:20.780 align:start position:0%
section one
 
01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
my issue with that is the last three
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
words danger has dissipated
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
to me I would assume that meant
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
something violent or dangerous but to
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
them it can be as simple as gesturing a
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
fist and saying I don't want to go with
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
you is when he gets removed to the quiet
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
room so I didn't know if there was a
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
possibility for clarification
 
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:46.030 align:start position:0%
possibility for clarification
the

01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
statutes as presently in the books
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
it speaks of imminent risk of physical
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
harm to the child or others
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot until that danger is
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
dissipated to me that last Clause
 
01:39:02.699 --> 01:39:04.250 align:start position:0%
dissipated to me that last Clause
um

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
goes with what precedes it it speaks of
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
physical harm to the child and others
 
01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
the child advocate is going to be
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
speaking next and she may wish to
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
address uh that
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
but it it it it seems to go together as
 
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:22.139 align:start position:0%
a piece in my reading
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
but I hear your concern it could be
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
twisted perhaps yes it's kind of
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
subjective whereas gesturing a fist to
 
01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
me wouldn't be imminent danger to
 
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
himself or others it can be constituted
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
as that because it is a physically
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
violent gesture
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I did have one more clarification on
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the section with the preference order
 
01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
for the adults which is the next page
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
under a it says a trusted adult selected
 
01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:47.219 align:start position:0%
by the child
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
um as it currently stands that doesn't
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
specify whether they have training or
 
01:39:50.639 --> 01:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
specify whether they have training or
not

01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
so that would be interesting to know
 
01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're required to have
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
training or Joe Schmo can be picked and
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
not know how to deal with an unruly
 
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
she has a question thank you would you
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
take any questions yes representative
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
Grossman with a question
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
coming and present and giving your
 
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.169 align:start position:0%
coming and present and giving your
testimony

01:40:24.169 --> 01:40:24.179 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
um how does this affect your son
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
he hates it
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
um he tells me every day that he wants
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
to lock himself in the room so that we
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
can't force him to go to school anymore
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that's just another
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
room great that it has video games but
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's not great that he has to sit there
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
and want to stay home and you know use
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
every threat in the book I mean I've had
 
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
dcyf at my house numerous times because
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
he knows what he can say to get out of
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
schoolwork to not have to go because he
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
goes to that quiet room I've had the
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
school psychologist in an IEP meeting
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
say that oh no we can't break up the day
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
into intervals to try and get him back
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
up into the classroom we need to leave
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
him in that room until he has no more
 
01:41:06.169 --> 01:41:06.179 align:start position:0%
Behavior so that he can return to that
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
and um unfortunately I've been in
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
different districts where that room
 
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
instead of being padded was a closet
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
um an actual closet like concrete walls
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
in the Manchester District so thankfully
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's now bigger and padded but you know
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's the same situation where he's been
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
there since four page four he's used
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
this quiet Ramon he's now nine he's it's
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
um my question to you is how
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
um with with this weekly occurrence how
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
is it affecting his uh ability to keep
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
up with the education
 
01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.709 align:start position:0%
up with the education
process

01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately he does have some
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
learning issues where he is behind in
 
01:41:59.090 --> 01:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
his peers but when he's in the classroom
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
for example right before we moved to
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
Loudon we were in the Raymond school
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
district and they didn't use a quiet
 
01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:06.350 align:start position:0%
district and they didn't use a quiet
room

01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
um he progressed from not really
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
participating in the classroom to
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
learning how to carry over the one which
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
I couldn't teach him
 
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
um learning how to read we found out
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
that he memorized his books so that's
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
why his reading level is better than
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
what we thought it was because he has
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
this neat trick where he hears one book
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
one time and he has it completely
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
memorized so the trick is to keep up
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
with him but he has his little niches
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
that you get to know and he makes so
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
much progress when he's actually in the
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
classrooms but unfortunately he has
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
learned since for on that if he has
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
these behaviors especially if he flops
 
01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:43.139 align:start position:0%
on the ground or threatens to flip a
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
table it's mostly threats you know but
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's when he gets put in
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
the quiet room and he tends to make a
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
lot less progress um this year he's made
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of progress in reading but for the
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
most part has stayed pretty
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
significantly behind
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony appreciate
 
01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.629 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony appreciate
that

01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
and the chair now calls uh Cassandra
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and Steve
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
members of the children family law
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Cassandra
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
Sanchez child advocate for the State of
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
so as you heard much testimony before me
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
indicating the Trump traumatizing
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
effects of seclusion I will not get too
 
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
deep into that topic for you I will
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
focus a bit though on the co-regulation
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
pieces I want to ensure that that is
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
understood by the committee
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
I also provided you a letter here from
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
Katie Peg NADA she is a licensed
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor she has
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
worked with my office in reviewing this
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill she has an expertise in
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
mental health clinical mental health
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
Counseling of children as well as
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
consultation in the schools so she
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
currently provides consultation to
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
schools around how to manage different
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
behaviors in a way that is trauma
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
informed and is less impactful to the
 
01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:12.350 align:start position:0%
informed and is less impactful to the
children

01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
and so a brief section I'm going to read
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
here for you from her letters when a
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
child is dysregulated is the job of an
 
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
adult who is responsible for the child
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
to emit safety in order for the child's
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
nervous system
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
to neurosep safety which opens the
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
pathways to regulation adults he met
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
safety through being in social
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
engagement State and utilizing calm
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
verbal and non-verbal communication
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
strategies this is what we call
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
co-regulation and so in speaking about
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
as was the question prior was about
 
01:44:47.209 --> 01:44:47.219 align:start position:0%
these adults in order and when we're
 
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
looking at a co-regulator it's not
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily a skill set the mtss
 
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
training that is is in the schools is
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
being expanded in the schools can cover
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
this but it's truly just understanding
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care which is meeting a
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
child where they're at and so a person
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
without training could actually be more
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
who has a close relationship to the
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
child could actually be more impactful
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
in these situations than somebody who is
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
trained in therapeutic techniques
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
because it's about being that calm body
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
getting to the child's level trying to
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
engage with them and and at times that
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
engagement could just be offering a
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
listening ear and that child may just be
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
screaming about what they're going
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
through and saying yes I understand
 
01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:32.219 align:start position:0%
that's difficult and so that doesn't
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
take a lot of training and that's one of
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
the benefits of having this this
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
co-regulation model is that we're not
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
asking the schools to employ additional
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
professionals that have specific
 
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:44.699 align:start position:0%
training and techniques to be able to do
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
this we're asking the school to engage
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
in the mtss which is being offered to
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
them to have a general understanding of
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care which we are asking
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
of all School professionals at this
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
point across the state and then we are
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
asking those people to understand that
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
the child is in crisis and understand
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
that they just need a calm person to
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
absorb their emotions in that moment and
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
enough where they they are no longer an
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
imminent risk of harm to themselves or
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
and so that that's a piece for me that
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
was really critical in taking a look at
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
improving the use of seclusion because
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
they do understand there are programs
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
that do use seclusion in this state
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
specifically because of the high needs
 
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
of the children that they serve and it's
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they're only using it when
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
they're when they have tried every other
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to de-escalate that child
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
they've tried the verbal techniques
 
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
they've tried to engage with them in
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
this way and absorb their emotions
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
they've tried to let them Express their
 
01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
emotions without intervention for a
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
moment and then they're getting to the
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
point where they're saying this child is
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
really a danger they're either attacking
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
staff or we have a lot of children
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
especially on the autism spectrum that
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
will be begin self-harming themselves
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
they may sit in a wall and start banging
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
their head aggressively and so it's
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
getting them away from that into a place
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
that has softer materials around them
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so there is some of the programs
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we work with do have the ability to
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
use seclusion safely and minimally only
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
when absolutely necessary and we're
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that continues as you
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
heard before me I believe it was Karen
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg from the DRC that share that
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
we do understand that there are schools
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
and Facilities that find loopholes to
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
this and so they may have an adult sit
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
in a room with a child but that adult's
 
01:47:27.169 --> 01:47:27.179 align:start position:0%
not interacting with a child they're not
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
attempting to co-regulate they're just
 
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
watching a child and so what this writes
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
in with the co-regulation is they can
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
sit there and watch the child for 30
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
minutes but after 30 minutes it is
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
within their role to either themselves
 
01:47:40.129 --> 01:47:40.139 align:start position:0%
or bring somebody else in who's actually
 
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
going to interact with that child and
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
and try to help them regulate and what
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
we know about about co-regulation is
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
that for children with
 
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
attachment issues which unfortunately we
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
see with a lot of children with trauma
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
histories and those who've been removed
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
from their home settings they do not
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to learn regulation on
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
their own in the time that children do
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
with healthy attachments so when
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
children have healthy attachments they
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
should be able to self-regulate around
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
adolescence they need support in their
 
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
younger years and in adolescence they
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
they start to learn about themselves and
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
understand what it takes to help calm
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
themselves down children with complex
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
trauma that does not happen in that time
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
frame so what we know is that they need
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
the support of these co-regulators to
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
learn how to self-regulate and so over
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
time this intervention by the
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
co-regulator will actually teach them
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
how to be able to do this on their own
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
and then they will be able to in in
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
young adulthood and later in adulthood
 
01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
be able to regulate on their own and
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
have better mental health outcomes and
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
overall health outcomes as we understand
 
01:48:44.649 --> 01:48:44.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
the only other question I think we have
 
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
is your
 
01:48:53.090 --> 01:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
legal analysis of lines four and five on
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
page one I can save you some time I'm
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
not an attorney
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'll take anybody I'm a social worker in
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
your social worker um
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
you see no difficulty in Your Capacity
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
as a social worker
 
01:49:07.159 --> 01:49:08.770 align:start position:0%
as a social worker
between

01:49:08.770 --> 01:49:08.780 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:49:12.729 --> 01:49:12.739 align:start position:0%
those two lines uh lines four and five
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
seclusion may not be used
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
but it may only be used yes so for I I
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
stand firmly in the same understanding
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
that Holly shared with us in that that
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
never is tied to explicitly to
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
punishment and discipline so because of
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
that language I do not see an issue with
 
01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:35.699 align:start position:0%
it but as as some had requested the
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
separation out and potentially shifting
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
them in a different order so it is more
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
clearly aligned I I would be in
 
01:49:43.930 --> 01:49:43.940 align:start position:0%
agreement and in support
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
the people who wrote the law that's
 
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
currently on the books had no difficulty
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
everything's the two together but okay
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the child
 
01:49:58.010 --> 01:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
advocate representative Nelson thank you
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it's just a quick one I mean
 
01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:02.820 align:start position:0%
I um I want to ask you the same question
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
that I asked earlier
 
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
um how did you determine or how did your
 
01:50:09.649 --> 01:50:09.659 align:start position:0%
group or people determine
 
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
um that the checking of the child at
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
regular intervals not to exceed 30
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
minutes yes so that that actually I
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with the licensed
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor on specifically
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
because taking a look at what is the
 
01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
extensive period understanding that it
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
may take time for especially in a school
 
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
setting where she does consultation in
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
schools it may take time to get the
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
preferred adult to be available for the
 
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:35.689 align:start position:0%
preferred adult to be available for the
child

01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
um if they're a classroom teacher or if
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're a janitor in another part of the
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
school it may take time so how much time
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
is it that a child could be left and
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
that the trauma impact is not going to
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
greatly affect their mental health and
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
their progress in life and so it was
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
determined that a 30-minute interval is
 
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:54.659 align:start position:0%
reasonable for a child to attempt to
 
01:50:56.570 --> 01:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
self-regulate and anything beyond that
 
01:50:58.370 --> 01:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
could be more damaging to their Mental
 
01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:59.149 align:start position:0%
could be more damaging to their Mental
Health

01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
all right just a follow-up please so hi
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um so if the child let's say
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
the child is in the room
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
for an hour and a half would that mean
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
that the only requirement would be that
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
there would be like
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
three check-ins
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
would the child be would the child
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
potentially be left alone
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
for long like periods of 29 minutes
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
and then another 29 minutes is that
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
possible I mean I'm just trying to
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure make sure that so that should be
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
only if there is
 
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
um seclusion by by current definition
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
right we were talking about a children
 
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
being imminent danger to themselves or
 
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else because these other
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
removals from a classroom to address
 
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
Behavior should accompany an adult and
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
so it really it makes it so that this is
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
instances where there is formal
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
seclusion that is used by the current
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
law where a child may have been for
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
instance in a facility they may have
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
been in a milieu and they started to
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
attack a child nearby them and so they
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
are removed and the staff is trying to
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
help de-escalate and in the process the
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
staff de-escalating the child is now
 
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
attacking the staff and is is aggressive
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
towards the staff and so at that point
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
they may use formal seclusion in which
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
they would have the child in the room my
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of them most of the way in
 
01:52:25.129 --> 01:52:25.139 align:start position:0%
which most of the facilities in the
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
state operate is that if they have a
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
child in seclusion in that room
 
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
they have an adult outside of the door
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
so the door may be locked or maybe held
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
by an adult but the adult is outside the
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
room watching for the child so if the
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
child is able to settle prior to that 30
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
minute time period
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
that child is then released from the
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
room by the staff member because they
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
are watching and so what this is saying
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that if they're watching and this
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
child is not able to regulate in that
 
01:52:56.209 --> 01:52:56.219 align:start position:0%
way then the staff is to intervene as
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to there are times where we have
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
seen seclusions at last beyond 30
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
minutes because a child isn't able to
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
regulate on their own and they may be
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
escalating in their behavior as they
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
stay there and so this is ensuring that
 
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
there is an adult that will intervene
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
even if they're still in a heightened
 
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:10.729 align:start position:0%
even if they're still in a heightened
state

01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
to attempt that opportunity and for some
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
they may have that one one touch point
 
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
with a staff member that may not be
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
enough for them to regulate so that
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
staff member may have to come back
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
outside that door and at that point
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
the hope is that they would then find
 
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
somebody I've attempted to regulate with
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
this child they're not taking to me so
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to find another staff member
 
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
to come in and do that the next
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
regulation with the child thank you I
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I was just trying to
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around that any other
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
questions for the child Advocates seeing
 
01:53:42.189 --> 01:53:42.199 align:start position:0%
none thank you so much
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
now we have a question before the
 
01:53:45.179 --> 01:53:47.410 align:start position:0%
now we have a question before the
committee

01:53:47.410 --> 01:53:47.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
if you really think
 
01:53:53.209 --> 01:53:53.219 align:start position:0%
that we've got to have an amendment
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
to break out more explicitly lines four
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
and five
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
that'll be one choice the other is
 
01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.530 align:start position:0%
that'll be one choice the other is
um

01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
the word only it may only it modifies by
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
punishment and discipline only
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
the bill is good as it is and we can
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
execute those are your two choices so
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see a show of hands how many
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
of you really want
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
us to wait and those of you putting your
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
hands up will be responsible for helping
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
the amendment to be written put your
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
how many of you think it's good to go
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and we can get this thing to the floor
 
01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
of the house and to the governor it
 
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
looks pretty good to me
 
01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.229 align:start position:0%
looks pretty good to me
so

01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:41.930 align:start position:0%
so

Mr chairman that that is good news
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I think you heard testimony that um
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
the oversight uh Commission on
 
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
children's services dealt with this
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
issue we were quite frankly horrified
 
01:57:22.129 --> 01:57:22.139 align:start position:0%
when we were notified of the
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
um the audit that had been done by
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
um a performance audit that had been
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
done at the Nashua Children's Home and
 
01:57:32.689 --> 01:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
the issue of seclusion came up so we
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
knew we had to do something and and
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
Senator alt Schiller
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
put in legislation and after the
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
children's oversight Services discussed
 
01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:44.330 align:start position:0%
children's oversight Services discussed
this

01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:45.169 align:start position:0%
this
um

01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
our child advocate was there and she
 
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
said I think we need to fine-tune this a
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
little bit and that afternoon she had
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
worked with the disability rights Center
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
and had language for an amendment which
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
was adopted
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
um on the floor and so hopefully
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed I think they did so
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
um let's get this one going to the
 
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
governor's office and do you know that
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
that same facility in Nashville is the
 
01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
subject of an hour and a half hearing
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
before DHHS oversight committee which I
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
chair yes I I was aware of that we were
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
and now Senator would you introduce
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 43 thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%

for your consideration this morning

assessment for juvenile minors who are
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
residents of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman Senate Bill 43 is just a
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
cleanup of a mistake that had been made
 
01:59:06.169 --> 01:59:06.179 align:start position:0%
in Senate bill 94.
 
01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
um as has been heard repeatedly in
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
discussing the sysc debate dcyf now does
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
a strengths and A needs assessment on
 
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
youth before they go to court on
 
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
delinquency charges we use that to make
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations to divert kids from
 
01:59:24.649 --> 01:59:24.659 align:start position:0%
court and towards services and it's
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
working great with a 7 to 72 percent of
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
kids being diverted
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
um we have one on unanticipated issue I
 
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:36.179 align:start position:0%
think um Mr chairman uh most of you
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
should know this bill came at the
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
request of the Department of Health and
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
um they've run into a problem
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
um along the border communities Senate
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 94 required assessments for all
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
youth no matter from what state they
 
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
came from but we only provide services
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
to kids from New Hampshire this means we
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
end up utilizing staff time and
 
02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
resources doing assessments for kids
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
from mass mostly Vermont and Maine who
 
02:00:09.649 --> 02:00:09.659 align:start position:0%
can't actually engage in the recommended
 
02:00:09.659 --> 02:00:10.850 align:start position:0%
can't actually engage in the recommended
services

02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
these are most typically shoplifting
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
charges from the Salem Mall that results
 
02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
in a fine all the bill does is make
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
clear that the assessment process is
 
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
intended for New Hampshire youths so at
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
this point Mr chair I will end my
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will try to answer any
 
02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:31.250 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will try to answer any
question

02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
I have a question the use of the word
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
resident in line nine I've got a note
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
saying what is the definition of that in
 
02:00:44.330 --> 02:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
line nine and also line four
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
well I think when we talk I know this
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
this can be a touchy issue
 
02:00:52.250 --> 02:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to voting but it's my
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
understand that Resident means that they
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
actually live here in New Hampshire as
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
you know children
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
um these youths they're 18 years and
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
Below well below the age of 18 they're
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
considered to be minors they live with
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
adults so they actually have to live
 
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of what the term
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
residence means is that defined in
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
statute anywhere Mr chairman I don't
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
want to say it is because I'm not sure
 
02:01:23.689 --> 02:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to give you folks
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
bad information but I would hope that
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of this statute it is
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
already in uh let's in statute
 
02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
02:01:43.689 --> 02:01:43.699 align:start position:0%
um back to the uh word resident
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
we have boarding schools
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
if a child is living at the boarding
 
02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.189 align:start position:0%
if a child is living at the boarding
school

02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%

02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
um representative I I'm not going to
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question because I'm not
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
sure and again I don't want to give you
 
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
bad information but someone is here from
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
the Department who hopefully will be
 
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question for you
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%

would you write a note for my next eye
 
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
exam please I literally have a lack of
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
peripheral vision I can see the senator
 
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
very well representative Bickford for
 
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
your question uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you my my
 
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand uh what's
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
happened I know uh
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
uh in my
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
community area there's no more any
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
diversion that it seems to have
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
disappeared and someone said well it's
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
gone it's being done through the state
 
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
now and so I've lost a little track of
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
of of this and so
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
to the children
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
um that say do live over the Border but
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
are coming up here and committing some
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
form of crime
 
02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.189 align:start position:0%
form of crime
um

02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
so do they still go to the court system
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative it's my understanding
 
02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
they do because they're held responsible
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
it's just when we talk about
 
02:03:36.179 --> 02:03:37.010 align:start position:0%
it's just when we talk about
um

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh the diversion process because our our
 
02:03:42.649 --> 02:03:42.659 align:start position:0%
hands are really tied we can't force
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
someone who lives in another state to
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
come back here to New Hampshire for
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
whatever treatment that the court has
 
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
outlined for them and that's where the
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
problem is so that's why we're looking
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
to change it to just be children that
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
live here in New Hampshire I would hope
 
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
that when a child from out of state
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
commits a crime here in New Hampshire
 
02:04:12.050 --> 02:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
that they work with those uh with that
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
other state to either
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
um with whatever recommendations they
 
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
have it's just that we are spending our
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
time and resources on assessing these
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
kids when we really at the end of the
 
02:04:24.599 --> 02:04:25.490 align:start position:0%
kids when we really at the end of the
day

02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
don't really have that kind of control
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
over them to get them into the types of
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
treatment that we think are would be
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them rather than some
 
02:04:35.689 --> 02:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
sort of punitive punishment thank you
 
02:04:37.070 --> 02:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:04:39.290 --> 02:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
02:04:44.089 --> 02:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
I almost see this as a problem
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
because if
 
02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
we're aboard a state I live on the
 
02:04:48.599 --> 02:04:49.490 align:start position:0%
we're aboard a state I live on the
border

02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
border
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
and if I see them coming over to our
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
town in tearing it all up
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
and they get arrested in our town and
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
they have to go to the Salem courts
 
02:05:07.129 --> 02:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
and we're not we can't do anything
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're not correcting the problem now
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question and I'm
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
trying to think of what would be an
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate answer it's not that these
 
02:05:21.070 --> 02:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
children are not being held responsible
 
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
there it's the fact that we're going to
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
go through this process of assessing
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
these children
 
02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
um as a way of trying to divert them out
 
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
of the system I think everyone in this
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
room knows about informed trauma there's
 
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
underlying reasons why kids are acting
 
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
out and sometimes it's better to divert
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
them into some sort of Mental Health
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
Care rather than putting them in some
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
sort of facility I think it also depends
 
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
upon the type of crime that has been
 
02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
upon the type of crime that has been
committed

02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
committed
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
um but I
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
I think I've answered your question
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
we're what we've done here in New
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we've really tried to keep
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
children out of the criminal justice
 
02:06:09.410 --> 02:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
system because I think Mo everyone in
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
this room realizes oftentimes when these
 
02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
kids come into contact if you don't get
 
02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
to the root of the problem they're going
 
02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
to keep coming back over and over and
 
02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
over again and what you really want to
 
02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:23.219 align:start position:0%
do is stop that so you really want to
 
02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
get to the root of the problem I'm not
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
saying that we shouldn't do this with
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
kids that commit crimes here it's just
 
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
that we can't enforce that when they go
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
back home and that's really what the
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
Crux of the problem is
 
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and just to back
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
up what Senator Carson had to say
 
02:06:45.599 --> 02:06:46.609 align:start position:0%
up what Senator Carson had to say
um

02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially in Border towns when a youth
 
02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
does break the law and they go to court
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
the courts will tell them there is a
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
diversion agency
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
that will accept your child who lives
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
02:07:08.410 --> 02:07:08.420 align:start position:0%
and they can do the diversion
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
or they can pay this penalty
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
so the court does
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
assess a penalty or the crime
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
but they offer now we can't again as
 
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson said we cannot force them
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
but the agency that
 
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm on the board for we have accepted
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
many young people from Haverhill
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Lowell and they have come in
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
and done challenge courses and thus and
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so it can happen but as she said it's
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
an interstate thing
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
my question is what does this leave
 
02:07:53.649 --> 02:07:53.659 align:start position:0%
empty now if the arresting agency
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
contemplates the initiation of Court
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings prior to filing a
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
delinquency petition that's what we have
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
now but if we restrict it by saying
 
02:08:06.589 --> 02:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
involving a resident minor
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what does the
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
arresting agency of somebody
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
who came over and did an expensive Smash
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
and grab in a jewelry store just over
 
02:08:20.089 --> 02:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
the border from Vermont what is the
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
arresting agency get to do now or if
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
should this pass well I thank you Mr
 
02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
chairman I would hope that they would
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
um talk with the authorities where this
 
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
child is from and they can core
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully coordinate something where the
 
02:08:38.689 --> 02:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
child is going to be held responsible
 
02:08:42.129 --> 02:08:42.139 align:start position:0%
for what they did in New Hampshire but
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
realizing that it might not be good for
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
the child if if the crime was serious
 
02:08:50.450 --> 02:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
enough to be held here in New Hampshire
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
that maybe there's something that they
 
02:08:53.209 --> 02:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
could do
 
02:08:56.089 --> 02:08:56.099 align:start position:0%
in the state where they came from I'm
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
wondering if um going forward after we
 
02:09:02.209 --> 02:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
passed this perhaps this would be a good
 
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
conversation with law enforcement
 
02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
agencies who live in Border towns or or
 
02:09:11.330 --> 02:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
are State Police troops that are on
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
Border towns
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
what problems do you see maybe you've
 
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
done that I don't know
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
well thank you again for the question I
 
02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:22.580 align:start position:0%
think any time that you can involve
 
02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:24.189 align:start position:0%
think any time that you can involve
everyone

02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
that is in contact with a child who is
 
02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
in trouble the better off that child is
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to be to get the type of help and
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
treatment they they really need to have
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
but I think they also need to be made
 
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that their actions
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
have consequences and I and again I I
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
strongly believe in our court system
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
that they work very very hard to do the
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
right thing for these kids and so this
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill simply just says look we're we
 
02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
can't really do these types of
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
assessment on kids from out of state
 
02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
unless they're actually being held I
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
mean oftentimes if it's a shoplifting
 
02:10:06.169 --> 02:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
crime they're charged here in New
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then they go home
 
02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
how are you going to make them come back
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
for that assessment
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
because usually they just let them go
 
02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:19.139 align:start position:0%
so the many people from out of state
 
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the representative references that
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
number presumably is going to shrink
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
considerably now
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I don't want to make that
 
02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
kind of assumption I just go on the fact
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
of that when we're dealing with children
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire as the department had
 
02:10:41.209 --> 02:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
stated we've seen a 72 percent drop in
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
the number of kids that are going into
 
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
the system and the diversion that we are
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions for the
 
02:10:55.370 --> 02:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
senator I'm yes representative DeSimone
 
02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just to clarify
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
when diversion agencies in this state
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
are dealing with in-state children
 
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
the fees are much different than when
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with an out-of-state
 
02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with an out-of-state
child

02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the difference and that's how
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
diversion agencies work and we went from
 
02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
needing 144 beds
 
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you Mr chairman
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
and I will see you all at one o'clock
 
02:11:34.679 --> 02:11:37.790 align:start position:0%
and I will see you all at one o'clock
yeah

02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
you get frequent flyer miles
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley got some recently
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
in my other committee so
 
02:11:46.739 --> 02:11:48.589 align:start position:0%
in my other committee so
yeah

02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:11:51.129 --> 02:11:51.139 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Beth magnesium from
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
dcyf and I got the name wrong didn't I
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
that was quite all right Mr chair it's
 
02:11:58.930 --> 02:11:58.940 align:start position:0%
Beth margison
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
Marge like you wrote yes margison so uh
 
02:12:06.050 --> 02:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh chair pear
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
Pearson chair of Vice chair long and all
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
um the division is here to support the
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
bill obviously because we asked Senator
 
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
Carson if she would gracefully sponsor
 
02:12:19.010 --> 02:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
this bill for us and I don't really need
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
to add anything else to what she said
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
other than to reiterate um or maybe
 
02:12:25.729 --> 02:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh get a little bit deeper on
 
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
the diversion aspect of this so this is
 
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
so what happens is is that
 
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
um children from out of state are still
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
subject to you know the process of you
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
know if it's a shoplifting restitution
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot it's what we want to do
 
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
for in-state children is to allow them
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
to participate in a diversion program we
 
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
obviously have no jurisdiction over
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
children who reside out of state so we
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
just need to make sure that we're
 
02:12:56.450 --> 02:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
spending our resources and
 
02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the is there a definition of
 
02:13:08.930 --> 02:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
a resident minor I mean I'm thinking of
 
02:13:10.729 --> 02:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
Summer Camps I'm thinking of boarding
 
02:13:10.739 --> 02:13:12.470 align:start position:0%
Summer Camps I'm thinking of boarding
schools

02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:13:14.089 --> 02:13:14.099 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative not that I'm aware of I
 
02:13:18.649 --> 02:13:18.659 align:start position:0%
mean it's just a suit it's just the
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
underpinning of the statute 169b because
 
02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's for children it's for children who
 
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
reside who are new in New Hampshire so
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's implicit in the statute that
 
02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
uh 169 B applies to children who are New
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:13:46.139 --> 02:13:46.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
um

02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
what happens when you've gone through
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
the process of an assessment with a
 
02:13:52.129 --> 02:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
resident child and then they moved to
 
02:13:52.139 --> 02:13:55.250 align:start position:0%
resident child and then they moved to
Massachusetts

02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I think I
 
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.390 align:start position:0%
um I think I
I think

02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:00.069 align:start position:0%
I think
um

02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the by the time they may have
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
moved we may have been done with their
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
diversion process
 
02:14:09.169 --> 02:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
um and then perhaps and if not perhaps a
 
02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
referral can be made but I actually
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
really don't know that's just my guess
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
to be honest thank you
 
02:14:15.239 --> 02:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
to be honest thank you
so

02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:20.089 --> 02:14:20.099 align:start position:0%
this does not really change
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
the fact that people from New Hampshire
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
shall be referred
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
for needs assessments already right here
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
in the Lubbock that is correct what it's
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
doing is those four words in both face
 
02:14:37.129 --> 02:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
italics it is restricting it and the
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
only reason I can think of is to save
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
some money so we can put our resources
 
02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
more to our own people yes yes it is you
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
know it utilize utilizing staff
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
resources not that we don't care about
 
02:14:50.569 --> 02:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
out-of-state children as I'm sure all of
 
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
you care about Aid of State children but
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
you know our responsibility is to
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
in-state is to New Hampshire residents
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
so utilizing our staff resources and
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
obviously you know there is a behavioral
 
02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
and and mental health provider shortage
 
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
in the in the state so actually being
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
able to Target this very valuable
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
assessment tool
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
um so that it's only used on New
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children is is quite quite
 
02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
impactful to your knowledge
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
um given granted the
 
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
significant shortage of resource
 
02:15:27.169 --> 02:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
Personnel are we seeing this in that
 
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
program presently if a child is arrested
 
02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
and is referred for A needs assessment
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
are we seeing a backlog you know we'll
 
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
do your needs assessment but you got to
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
wait two months because we don't have
 
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
enough people
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so in Juvenile Justice
 
02:15:46.490 --> 02:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure if we contract with
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
an outside agency to do it I don't know
 
02:15:48.599 --> 02:15:49.790 align:start position:0%
an outside agency to do it I don't know
that

02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:51.169 --> 02:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about the backlogs on
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
for Beth marcheson
 
02:15:59.689 --> 02:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you always ask very
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%

answer sometimes thank you keep coming
 
02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.219 align:start position:0%

02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
it and I now close the hearing on Senate
 
02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:17.940 align:start position:0%

02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
how many of you think this bill needs
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
more work versus how many of you think
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's good to go
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
for exacting how many needs more work
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
hands up
 
02:16:33.129 --> 02:16:33.139 align:start position:0%

02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
2 15 the the committee Services is going
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit of room Readjustment
 
02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
we are inviting the Judiciary Committee
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
and others who are interested in the
 
02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:23.099 align:start position:0%
practices of the Judiciary we've had
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
several bills that we tabled because we
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
agreed that some of the bills have some
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
good points to them but some of them
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
evidence not enough knowledge of how the
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary works so from 2 30
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
on we will be having the first of what
 
02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
may be several continuing education
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
events so we can learn more about how
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
the court system works
 
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
I received from the clerk of the house
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
four Senate bills that crossed over and
 
02:19:58.730 --> 02:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
were assigned to this committee we will
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
have done all four of these today I have
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
no further bills but the Senate is still
 
02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
senating so there may be more we will
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
not meet next Tuesday because we have
 
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
nothing other nothing to meet about but
 
02:20:17.929 --> 02:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
as soon as I start getting additional
 
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
bills I'll let you know that I have and
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
what their numbers are and I'll try to
 
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
group them so we don't come up for an
 
02:20:27.889 --> 02:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
hour and a half and have to go back home
 
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
again but we'll try to group them so
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
that we'll make a day of it I think most
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
people like that so there we go and oh
 
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
I've also heard from
 
02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
the powers that be that the rule is
 
02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:45.950 align:start position:0%
the powers that be that the rule is
still

02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
you may have we may have water in the
 
02:20:51.889 --> 02:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
room but we've got to take our food and
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
beverages other than water elsewhere and
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean another room like this
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
one and I've been guilty of that so when
 
02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
that came down I said I got to pass this
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
along just in case that I brought a
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
sandwich and a beverage and I'm going
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
down to the cafeteria to have it so just
 
02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
to just a reminder of what we were told
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
but I think I know I forgot so there we
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
I asked our people at dcyf how we Define
 
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
Resident and we use the definition of
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
resident in the doe statutes just so
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
since there are questions of it
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay could you get that for us and send
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
it our way I certainly canceled thank
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
are you looking for the definition now
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
because she's going to write the blurb
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
and if you could get it to her fairly
 
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
quickly we could incorporate it in her
 
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
committee report otherwise we're going
 
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
to be challenged somebody will pull the
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill off consent and it's a mess so if
 
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
you can get that for her that'll be
 
02:22:24.889 --> 02:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.899 --> 02:25:01.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:22.729 --> 03:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:22.739 --> 03:38:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
we

03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
have two of Senator Carson's two bills
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
that have already gone on to consent
 
03:38:32.040 --> 03:38:33.410 align:start position:0%
that have already gone on to consent
today

03:38:33.410 --> 03:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:38:35.330 --> 03:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
and here we are at the one o'clock hour
 
03:38:47.769 --> 03:38:47.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
you framed that so well ever consider
 
03:38:50.460 --> 03:38:56.150 align:start position:0%
you framed that so well ever consider
politics

03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.849 --> 03:39:01.859 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think again we've had a
 
03:39:59.450 --> 03:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
lot of information today about kids and
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
and trying to do the right things for
 
03:40:04.750 --> 03:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
kids and this is another one of those
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
cornerstones this bill was a a request
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:11.090 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
Services

03:40:11.090 --> 03:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is it allows
 
03:40:16.370 --> 03:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
non-related legal Guardians for kids to
 
03:40:18.650 --> 03:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
qualify for TANF benefits the same way
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
that related legal Guardians for kids
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
qualify for TANF benefits
 
03:40:28.130 --> 03:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
former Division III Vice chair and a
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
former Senator Aaron Hennessey when she
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
was in the house had a meeting with
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
director ribsum in a family last year
 
03:40:37.610 --> 03:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
the family was an older couple and were
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
the legal guardians of four or five
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
children who were not related by blood
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
but who were for all of their purposes
 
03:40:47.690 --> 03:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
their grandchildren for many years they
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
were the children of their daughters
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
longtime partner
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
when parents developed serious substance
 
03:40:57.050 --> 03:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
abuse issues these grandparents obtained
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
legal guardianship of the kids but the
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
TANF program only allowed the benefit
 
03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
for blood relatives so they didn't
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
qualify and really could not afford to
 
03:41:10.370 --> 03:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
care for all of those children
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
after the meeting the Department of
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services met with the
 
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
03:41:18.769 --> 03:41:18.779 align:start position:0%
which told DHHS that they could approve
 
03:41:23.530 --> 03:41:23.540 align:start position:0%
dhh's dhhs's plan to apply TANF benefits
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
to these types of situation but that our
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
statute would need to be amended in
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
order to authorize this this is why you
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front of you today
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
there is enough money in TANF to cover
 
03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
this so it's all federal dollars there
 
03:41:43.250 --> 03:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
is no general fund impact and the Senate
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
did pass this unanimously
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as I said earlier we've had
 
03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion especially today in
 
03:41:55.190 --> 03:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
this committee about children and
 
03:41:57.170 --> 03:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
supporting children keeping them out of
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
our systems this is another way to keep
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
these kids connected to families that
 
03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
have raised them even though those
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
families are not related by blood
 
03:42:11.090 --> 03:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
we want to preserve that we want to
 
03:42:13.790 --> 03:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
preserve that safety net for them we
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
want to preserve what's normal as much
 
03:42:19.190 --> 03:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
as we can for these kids so instead of
 
03:42:22.190 --> 03:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
them moving them out of a loving family
 
03:42:24.530 --> 03:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
situation and being placed with
 
03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
strangers in foster care Let's help
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
those families that are trying to do the
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
right thing by these kids and provide
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
that environment for them they need some
 
03:42:34.080 --> 03:42:35.269 align:start position:0%
that environment for them they need some
help

03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
all you need to do is look at what's
 
03:42:37.439 --> 03:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
all you need to do is look at what's
happening

03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
happening
 
03:42:42.590 --> 03:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
um ins in our uh economy today where the
 
03:42:45.769 --> 03:42:45.779 align:start position:0%
price of of goods is has gone up so much
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
especially food and the price of the
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
packaging has gone has gotten smaller so
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
families are having to spend more and
 
03:42:57.050 --> 03:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
more of a limited budget on on their
 
03:43:00.290 --> 03:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
food so they need some help and I see
 
03:43:03.290 --> 03:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
this bill as a way to help it's going to
 
03:43:05.929 --> 03:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
help children it's going to help the
 
03:43:08.570 --> 03:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
families that are taking them in and I
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a win-win for everyone so
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
at this point Mr chairman I will
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and I will try to
 
03:43:18.170 --> 03:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
answer questions but there are folks
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%

03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%

172 and just just relay uh some personal
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
experience that we've had in our family
 
03:44:55.560 --> 03:44:56.330 align:start position:0%
experience that we've had in our family
um

03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
in 2019 uh a friend of my daughters my
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
oldest daughters was going through a
 
03:45:06.530 --> 03:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
tough time in her home and it got to a
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
point where her mom here in Littleton
 
03:45:11.330 --> 03:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
was not able to take care of her her
 
03:45:15.170 --> 03:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
anymore and she was placed with her
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
biological father in Maine and that
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
lasted for not very long a couple of
 
03:45:22.849 --> 03:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
months and it was clear to everyone
 
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
around that that situation in Maine was
 
03:45:27.530 --> 03:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
not ideal for her she was not thriving
 
03:45:29.929 --> 03:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
she was a senior in high school actually
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
junior in high school at that time she
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
was struggling with with new new school
 
03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
new friends new home new scenarios and
 
03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
the the situation uh was just was just
 
03:45:44.330 --> 03:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
not ideal so you know when when when
 
03:45:47.570 --> 03:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
doors open for you you you tend to look
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
at them and try to try to recognize him
 
03:45:52.370 --> 03:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
and walk through them so it came to a
 
03:45:54.650 --> 03:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
point where she needed to be home in
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
Littleton but the situation nation that
 
03:45:58.729 --> 03:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
she would have gone into was not ideal
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and she probably would not have been
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
permitted to be in that situation so at
 
03:46:05.150 --> 03:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
the time my wife and I uh we went
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
through the court system and got a
 
03:46:09.410 --> 03:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
guardianship of this young woman and we
 
03:46:10.969 --> 03:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
knew it was going to be for a temporary
 
03:46:10.979 --> 03:46:12.429 align:start position:0%
knew it was going to be for a temporary
time

03:46:12.429 --> 03:46:12.439 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:46:14.929 --> 03:46:14.939 align:start position:0%
but it was going to be able to provide
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
her with some stability where she could
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
continue to be with her friends in her
 
03:46:19.849 --> 03:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
school in her community that she had
 
03:46:23.870 --> 03:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
known uh from from from the get-go so it
 
03:46:26.809 --> 03:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
was then that our family really started
 
03:46:29.330 --> 03:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
getting a taste for what that what that
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
meant what the guardianship was and we
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
realized that there are things that are
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
covered we were able to get our Medicaid
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
benefits and were able to make sure that
 
03:46:40.010 --> 03:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
she could continue to see her her
 
03:46:41.929 --> 03:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
primary care physician while she lived
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
with us but the little things the little
 
03:46:46.250 --> 03:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
things that make a big difference in
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
these kids lives uh going to the prom
 
03:46:51.769 --> 03:46:51.779 align:start position:0%
going to get your hair done she was
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
seeing Physicians for various things and
 
03:46:55.849 --> 03:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
some of the things are not covered uh
 
03:46:58.010 --> 03:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
would would have been covered now for us
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
it was it was one child that was for a
 
03:47:02.809 --> 03:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
very short period of time but this would
 
03:47:05.690 --> 03:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
really speak to the folks and help the
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
people that you're going to hear from in
 
03:47:10.010 --> 03:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
a little bit that have responded to the
 
03:47:13.250 --> 03:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
things in our society that uh are big
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
issues we debate these issues in
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall all the time but
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
it's the people that are rolling up
 
03:47:21.530 --> 03:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
their sleeves and getting their hands
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
dirty in the communities this bill is

03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
support this if you look at the fiscal
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
note and the funding it's it's not
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be burdensome
 
03:47:39.250 --> 03:47:39.260 align:start position:0%
to us but it will pay off in dividends
 
03:47:42.530 --> 03:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
to our communities into those the parts
 
03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:43.979 align:start position:0%

03:48:20.450 --> 03:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you for
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh any questions you may have about the
 
03:48:25.190 --> 03:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
TANF program and general be able to
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
answer but the department does support
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
this bill we do recognize the need to be
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
able to support this population of
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
people find Family Dynamics in the
 
03:48:41.570 --> 03:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
country really are changing so we want
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
our environment to be able to change
 
03:48:45.889 --> 03:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
with that and there is a tremendous need
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
we hear story after story about
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who are taking care of
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
children who they're not related to so
 
03:48:55.969 --> 03:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
we wanted to act on this and take steps
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to help those
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
particular individuals to help these
 
03:49:02.450 --> 03:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
kids so more individuals are end up
 
03:49:04.690 --> 03:49:04.700 align:start position:0%
taking maybe it's a friend or neighbor
 
03:49:06.950 --> 03:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
of somebody who has a child that has
 
03:49:10.190 --> 03:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
this kind of need we're hearing more of
 
03:49:13.190 --> 03:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
an increase of these situations so the
 
03:49:14.690 --> 03:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
department really would like to be able
 
03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
to respond and support these families
 
03:49:21.550 --> 03:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of that is preventative
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
from uh being a part of the child
 
03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
welfare system or becoming part of the
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
child welfare system which attorney
 
03:49:33.530 --> 03:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
margeson could certainly speak to better
 
03:49:35.809 --> 03:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
than I can but there is a preventative
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
Factor here that I think is really
 
03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
important to make a note of so if you
 
03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'm happy to answer
 
03:49:45.530 --> 03:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
any questions for Miss Hebert
 
03:49:48.290 --> 03:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:49:50.690 --> 03:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so I noticed in
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
here there's no income qualifiers is
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
that the case in tan if this is not
 
03:49:58.389 --> 03:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
going to be sold I take in a grandchild
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm doing okay
 
03:50:03.650 --> 03:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
there's no income qualifies I could
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
still qualify for what this bill will
 
03:50:08.570 --> 03:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
apply for correct that's my
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
understanding yes that's great thank you
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
03:50:15.889 --> 03:50:15.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm on the same
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
line here I think
 
03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
03:50:19.380 --> 03:50:20.450 align:start position:0%
my concern is
um

03:50:20.450 --> 03:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
once you've had this guidingship granted
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:50:27.410 --> 03:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
and you would like to get some money to
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
help to fray costs would you not first
 
03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
have to look into child support from the
 
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
natural parents
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely an option and
 
03:50:40.610 --> 03:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
actually a requirement of the TANF
 
03:50:43.309 --> 03:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
program that if you are a recipient of
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
TANF you're required to cooperate with
 
03:50:48.410 --> 03:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services in
 
03:50:50.570 --> 03:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
order for them to pursue child support
 
03:50:53.090 --> 03:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
against the parents of that child so yes
 
03:50:56.530 --> 03:50:56.540 align:start position:0%
that there are exceptions to that
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking yes they would
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
need to then cooperate with the
 
03:51:04.010 --> 03:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
Department to pursue child support if
 
03:51:08.210 --> 03:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
we were told that the funding is federal
 
03:51:13.130 --> 03:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
is that in perpetuity or is this like a
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
three-year Grant and then we need to
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
pick it up no this is permanent as much
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
as we can count on Washington's
 
03:51:24.410 --> 03:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
permanency yes sir thank you any other
 
03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:26.210 align:start position:0%
permanency yes sir thank you any other
questions

03:51:26.210 --> 03:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:51:28.849 --> 03:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative Raymond
 
03:51:30.889 --> 03:51:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:51:34.250 --> 03:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question so currently TANF is
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
capped at how many years like an
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
individual or family can have Tana for
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
themselves is there a limit for years
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
for this program so if someone were to
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
for example take custody or guardianship
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
of a of a young child would they have
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
support throughout the child's lifetime
 
03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I'm going
 
03:51:55.130 --> 03:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
to defer to our subject matter expert
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
Miss McKinley to help answer that
 
03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
question from the Department
 
03:51:59.700 --> 03:52:05.269 align:start position:0%
question from the Department
thanks

03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
so as far as time frames for this
 
03:52:12.050 --> 03:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
program specifically there is not a time
 
03:52:14.570 --> 03:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
frame so if it's regular TANF it's a
 
03:52:17.090 --> 03:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
five-year limit but for the program that
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
they would fall under it would be no
 
03:52:18.720 --> 03:52:22.370 align:start position:0%
they would fall under it would be no
limit

03:52:22.370 --> 03:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
or until the child turns 18.
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Ms Hebert
 
03:52:33.229 --> 03:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair next calls on you
 
03:52:36.830 --> 03:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
Colleen McKinley yeah my timing was just
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
off I actually just put my name on there
 
03:52:47.269 --> 03:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
just to be available for any questions
 
03:52:49.969 --> 03:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the TANF program and
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
what we're offering for this bill
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
any representative McMahon
 
03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Ms McKinley
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
just the clarification on the statement
 
03:53:05.450 --> 03:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
you just made a relative to 18 being the
 
03:53:05.460 --> 03:53:07.150 align:start position:0%
you just made a relative to 18 being the
TANF

03:53:07.150 --> 03:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
TANF
 
03:53:09.130 --> 03:53:09.140 align:start position:0%
funding limit
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
if it's a handicapped individual would
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
that go to go to 21
 
03:53:15.889 --> 03:53:15.899 align:start position:0%
so it actually goes up to the age of 20
 
03:53:18.250 --> 03:53:18.260 align:start position:0%
if an individual is still in high school
 
03:53:22.969 --> 03:53:22.979 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go based upon disability
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
but now we know it's if you're in high
 
03:53:28.010 --> 03:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
school to age 20. yep full-time all
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much
 
03:53:32.510 --> 03:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:53:35.150 --> 03:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman just just to
 
03:53:39.710 --> 03:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
you know that this goes on for the life
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know for the until the child turns
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
18 or or what have you uh and it's
 
03:53:50.410 --> 03:53:50.420 align:start position:0%
defined uh it's segregated by allowing
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
court appointed Guardians so it's court
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
appointed Guardians
 
03:53:58.330 --> 03:53:58.340 align:start position:0%
um that could receive this TANF benefit
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh for as long as as long as they need
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is that is that the case correct okay
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
since I got for Christmas a book of all
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
the laws that have to do with anyway I
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
just read it and I see that the only
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
change to 167 6 V is putting in or a
 
03:54:24.050 --> 03:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
court appointed Guardian so everything
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
else has been humming along real happy
 
03:54:29.689 --> 03:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
since whenever and this is the only
 
03:54:32.450 --> 03:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
change right correct good
 
03:54:32.460 --> 03:54:35.090 align:start position:0%
change right correct good
foreign

03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%

I am a quarter point of the uh Guardian
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh four and a half years ago we took in
 
03:55:03.710 --> 03:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
three children that were the uh niece
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
and nephews of one of our biological
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
Sons girlfriends
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:55:12.290 --> 03:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
we had never met them before the parents
 
03:55:12.300 --> 03:55:13.210 align:start position:0%
we had never met them before the parents
have

03:55:13.210 --> 03:55:13.220 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh drug problems and the fact uh
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
just last week we had a herring to
 
03:55:22.929 --> 03:55:22.939 align:start position:0%
terminate their parental rights
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
where we're not related we don't qualify
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
for any of the uh any of the benefits
 
03:55:32.090 --> 03:55:32.100 align:start position:0%

involved uh with them all year long and
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
some nights uh during basketball season
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%

just looking for a little help we don't
 
03:56:13.610 --> 03:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
want we don't want someone else to raise
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
them for us because I think we're doing
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
a pretty good job of that ourselves but
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit of help would go a long
 
03:56:22.610 --> 03:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%

um I'm here today to voice our strong
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
support for Senate Bill 172 and to share
 
03:58:03.650 --> 03:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
insights gathered uh over the three and
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
a half years uh that we have been
 
03:58:08.090 --> 03:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
launching the Statewide kinship
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
navigation program rooted within the
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
network of New Hampshire's Family
 
03:58:14.929 --> 03:58:14.939 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers the kinship navigation
 
03:58:17.689 --> 03:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
program provides an array of supports to
 
03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
kinship families regardless of child
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
welfare involvement
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what their
 
03:58:25.370 --> 03:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
relationship is the legal status of
 
03:58:28.729 --> 03:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
those families the program is free it's
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary and it aims to strengthen and
 
03:58:33.050 --> 03:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
sustain the well-being of Kinship
 
03:58:34.849 --> 03:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
Caregivers and the children in their
 
03:58:34.859 --> 03:58:36.410 align:start position:0%
Caregivers and the children in their
care

03:58:36.410 --> 03:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
um this overall helps with reducing
 
03:58:42.050 --> 03:58:42.060 align:start position:0%
system barriers economic stressors and
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
it increases the protective factors
 
03:58:46.130 --> 03:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
which they alluded to earlier when they
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
send those prevention strategies so the
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
decrease to placement disruptions for
 
03:58:54.170 --> 03:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
children and kinship care our frcs
 
03:58:55.729 --> 03:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
around the state have offered such
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
support to 755 families in 821 children
 
03:59:02.090 --> 03:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
that have been placed in their care over
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
the course of the program
 
03:59:05.689 --> 03:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
we know that a child's need for
 
03:59:07.490 --> 03:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted sense of love and
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
belonging is necessity for healthy
 
03:59:11.689 --> 03:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
development and that a growing body of
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
Research indicates placement with kin
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
can be the next best option a child has
 
03:59:20.590 --> 03:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
to safely remain in care of his or her
 
03:59:23.809 --> 03:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
biological parents many children however
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
have bonds with individuals who are not
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
related by birth or adoption or marriage
 
03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
just as the case in the Millers
 
03:59:32.929 --> 03:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
and they have those really strong
 
03:59:35.570 --> 03:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
relationships with them as well these
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
fictive can can provide care and
 
03:59:39.769 --> 03:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
stability for a child when out of home
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
placement is absolutely necessary
 
03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
in 70 percent of kinship placements the
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
driving factor is substance use disorder
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
in one or both of those parents
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
these can or fictive Kinship Caregivers
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
agree to take the child or children who
 
03:59:59.330 --> 03:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
cannot or should not remain at least in
 
04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
the short term in the care with their
 
04:00:04.250 --> 04:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
parents in many cases dcaf also makes
 
04:00:05.929 --> 04:00:05.939 align:start position:0%
the determination that the placement
 
04:00:08.150 --> 04:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
with these kin or fictive kin families
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the children
 
04:00:12.769 --> 04:00:12.779 align:start position:0%
or child so these placements are court
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
ordered we know that despite the
 
04:00:17.090 --> 04:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
prevalence that these care Arrangements
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
both inside and outside of the Foster
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
system have there are many contacts
 
04:00:24.050 --> 04:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
contexts in which the law does not
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
recognize them in these relationships
 
04:00:29.450 --> 04:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the children
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
these Kinship Caregivers should have the
 
04:00:34.610 --> 04:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
same access to TANF as the biological
 
04:00:37.130 --> 04:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
parents and this bill takes a really
 
04:00:38.689 --> 04:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
important step in acknowledging and
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
supporting both kinship and fictive
 
04:00:40.680 --> 04:00:43.490 align:start position:0%
supporting both kinship and fictive
caregivers

04:00:43.490 --> 04:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
caregivers
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the effort to expand TANF eligibility
 
04:00:48.530 --> 04:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
to court appointed a court appointed
 
04:00:50.630 --> 04:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
Guardians including the effective can
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrates New Hampshire's commitment
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
to the health and well-being of our most
 
04:00:57.170 --> 04:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children and we do urge the
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
passage of this important measure thank
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
you so much for having us
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
will you take questions I can try and I
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
have my subject experts behind me if I
 
04:01:12.170 --> 04:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative disamoni
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:01:18.650 --> 04:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question I hope this is an
 
04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
easy one for you
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
how many effective in kinship care
 
04:01:27.769 --> 04:01:27.779 align:start position:0%
families do we currently have sure so
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is out of a percentage uh taken
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
within the last three years span it's
 
04:01:34.969 --> 04:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
about six and a half percent so you
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a whole number for you but of
 
04:01:40.849 --> 04:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
100 of those families served in an FRC
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
capacity so these are just at the Family
 
04:01:45.290 --> 04:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers six and a half percent
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
are fictive kin families
 
04:01:51.530 --> 04:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up thank you I
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
too want to express my
 
04:01:57.530 --> 04:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
um pleasure at being able to hopefully
 
04:02:00.769 --> 04:02:00.779 align:start position:0%
assist families that do this uh this
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
goes above and beyond it takes a village
 
04:02:04.849 --> 04:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
to raise a child these people are really
 
04:02:06.650 --> 04:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
putting themselves out there and I thank
 
04:02:10.370 --> 04:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask a would you believe
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
question would you believe the fount of
 
04:02:17.170 --> 04:02:17.180 align:start position:0%
all wisdom here Dr Google
 
04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
says that not recognizing fictive can
 
04:02:21.420 --> 04:02:23.530 align:start position:0%
says that not recognizing fictive can
relationships

04:02:23.530 --> 04:02:23.540 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
harms children 100 so this one gets a
 
04:02:27.840 --> 04:02:28.910 align:start position:0%
harms children 100 so this one gets a
vote

04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

04:02:55.490 --> 04:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
what is it it is the Family Resource
 
04:02:57.590 --> 04:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
Center at Gorham got it
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
name is Patty stolti and thank you for
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
listening to me I am here because I am
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
the executive director of The Family
 
04:03:07.250 --> 04:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
Resource Center in Gorham that covers
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire
 
04:03:11.929 --> 04:03:11.939 align:start position:0%
and I am also a parent of two children
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
that are non-related to me that I've
 
04:03:14.160 --> 04:03:15.410 align:start position:0%
that are non-related to me that I've
raised

04:03:15.410 --> 04:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
raised
 
04:03:17.389 --> 04:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
um one since she was two and the other
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
since he was five and they are adults
 
04:03:22.849 --> 04:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
thriving in our local communities and
 
04:03:24.769 --> 04:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
I'm very very proud and I'd like to
 
04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
reiterate what
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
um Mr Miller said which is they have
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
given me far more than I have given them
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
and there have been times when I've
 
04:03:33.290 --> 04:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
really struggled financially so I
 
04:03:36.290 --> 04:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
understand that but when people are
 
04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
willing to step up
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and more and more substance misuse is
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
really seeping into our communities and
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
causing Havoc I don't need to tell you
 
04:03:48.050 --> 04:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
that and quite simply I just want to say
 
04:03:49.849 --> 04:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
these families that are willing to step
 
04:03:52.490 --> 04:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
up really do need the support and and I
 
04:03:54.889 --> 04:03:54.899 align:start position:0%
and again you know I never want to put a
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
burden on our state
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
um that isn't going to be really
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
productive and this is a very productive
 
04:04:04.490 --> 04:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
investment in our families and in these
 
04:04:06.469 --> 04:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
and our children because our children
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
deserve they deserve this it's it's I I
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
want to say it's a no-brainer but that's
 
04:04:15.410 --> 04:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
how I feel I just we see it time and
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
time again and we see the outcomes we
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
know the Millers are very well their
 
04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
children are just amazed
 
04:04:24.650 --> 04:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
at what love these two people give them
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and it's a really beautiful thing so
 
04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
I from the heart side I just want to say
 
04:04:32.150 --> 04:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
please give this I urge you to consider
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
the the importance of this bill
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions
 
04:04:45.050 --> 04:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:45.060 --> 04:04:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
Littleton

point in time in our life we were empty
nesters

04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
nesters
 
04:05:23.929 --> 04:05:23.939 align:start position:0%
we were getting ready to travel the
 
04:05:26.330 --> 04:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
world the only way we travel now is
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
with basketballs and soccer cleats and
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
smelly smelly shoes you know it's but we
 
04:05:36.769 --> 04:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change it these kids have
 
04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
you know they've done a lot for us
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
and they thank us every day every time
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
every meal that we feed them every
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%

04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
food thank you we're out to dinner and
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
they'll say thank you for giving us food
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
and it's like
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
what they grew up on was Cumby's Pizza
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
when when we were going out to dinner
 
04:05:58.969 --> 04:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
one night they were very upset that they
 
04:06:00.769 --> 04:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
weren't having Cumby's pizza because
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
that was the drugstop that they used to
 
04:06:02.640 --> 04:06:03.410 align:start position:0%
that was the drugstop that they used to
make

04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
they didn't know any different
 
04:06:05.340 --> 04:06:07.790 align:start position:0%
they didn't know any different
and

04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:09.889 --> 04:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
you know the oldest the oldest boy just
 
04:06:13.250 --> 04:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
got his braces off a month ago what did
 
04:06:15.170 --> 04:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
he do last a couple weekends ago through
 
04:06:18.370 --> 04:06:18.380 align:start position:0%
his retainers in the trash at the mall
 
04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm like really so there was 750 on last
 
04:06:25.010 --> 04:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
Friday we had to dish out
 
04:06:27.769 --> 04:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
and now we've got AAU this week that's
 
04:06:29.570 --> 04:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars that we have to
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
somehow find for him because he's he's
 
04:06:35.450 --> 04:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
good he's a good basketball player and
 
04:06:37.010 --> 04:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is what he wants to do with his
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
life he wants to play basketball we're
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
looking at colleges you know he he
 
04:06:43.450 --> 04:06:43.460 align:start position:0%
deserves a chance at life too
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
and basketball sneakers are expensive
 
04:06:48.290 --> 04:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
you're looking at two three hundred
 
04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
dollars a pop
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
for good basketball sneakers and he goes
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
through at least two pairs a year and
 
04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
then his sister's coming up who I just
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
had to order cleats the other not last
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
night no it was last night you know
 
04:07:01.439 --> 04:07:02.389 align:start position:0%
night no it was last night you know
because

04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
softball started and now we need bats
 
04:07:06.729 --> 04:07:06.739 align:start position:0%
and I told her we're not getting a bat
 
04:07:09.530 --> 04:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know and then the little guy pops up
 
04:07:12.530 --> 04:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
well I need a bat too and I said but he
 
04:07:14.090 --> 04:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
says my cleats were cheaper because we
 
04:07:15.769 --> 04:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
went to the consignment store for ten
 
04:07:18.170 --> 04:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
dollars and bought ours I'm like you're
 
04:07:19.729 --> 04:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
right you know it's just the little
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
things if we could get a little bit of
 
04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
help groceries 350 a week easily and
 
04:07:27.769 --> 04:07:27.779 align:start position:0%
that's that's on a that's on a low week
 
04:07:30.170 --> 04:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
you know we both work two jobs so that
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
we can afford these kids we didn't have
 
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
to work two jobs I I had a home daycare
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
for 22 years
 
04:07:38.929 --> 04:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
but we ran out of room in the house I
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
had to give that up
 
04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
and go out to work and he's working two
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
jobs I work two jobs
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of help when we had the
 
04:07:53.689 --> 04:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
pandemic card the EBT card that was so
 
04:07:55.969 --> 04:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
helpful we didn't have to worry you know
 
04:07:58.010 --> 04:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
we've got enough money for extra food
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's the little things and
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for a million dollars
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of help with clothes
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
or food
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%

04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%

04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
signs his pro basketball career you get
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
a tenth of that contract that's right he
 
04:08:23.150 --> 04:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
knows that
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
he had his first little fan this year
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
that we had to sign an autographed
 
04:08:27.650 --> 04:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
picture for
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you so much for testifying
 
04:08:31.080 --> 04:08:33.710 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you so much for testifying
and

04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:36.410 --> 04:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
Beth margison from dcyf did I get it
 
04:08:39.170 --> 04:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
right this time Beth I got that right
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
and Marge just said I got it right
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
finally it takes me a while with names
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
to get them right well also as
 
04:08:48.650 --> 04:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative Petrino pointed out I
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't really write very clearly on my
 
04:08:53.150 --> 04:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
pink card you nailed this one I did
 
04:08:55.490 --> 04:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
because he told me to do that on the
 
04:08:57.849 --> 04:08:57.859 align:start position:0%
elevator on the way up and also I was
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
admiring representative panic's gorgeous
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
handwriting and so inspired by her I
 
04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
tried very hard to make sure that I
 
04:09:06.889 --> 04:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
wrote very clearly
 
04:09:09.889 --> 04:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
um so anyway a little hard to to follow
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
the Millers but I will try
 
04:09:14.450 --> 04:09:14.460 align:start position:0%

04:09:38.570 --> 04:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
to take them on is something that we
 
04:09:40.610 --> 04:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support and I'll take any
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
questions if if you have them how do you
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
follow the Miller's tale right yeah I'm
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
just hoping I can get off quickly
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I yeah I just want
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
to be clear on
 
04:09:58.150 --> 04:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
um because it's I don't see it in here
 
04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
that it's code it's any court appointed
 
04:10:04.370 --> 04:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
Guardian so whether you're a relative or
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
not you qualify yes that is correct you
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
do not have to be a relative to become a
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
guardian okay
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
and also the length of TANF
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is for the Youth of the child
 
04:10:21.650 --> 04:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
um I will defer to TANF because I'm not
 
04:10:24.110 --> 04:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
a tenant uh expert but they set up until
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
the child is 18. all right and and how
 
04:10:28.969 --> 04:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
is that defined
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
how was that the finding here
 
04:10:31.199 --> 04:10:33.769 align:start position:0%
how was that the finding here
I

04:10:33.769 --> 04:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.450 --> 04:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
yeah how do we how do we know that this
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
is not the regular five-year TANF the
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
04:10:42.769 --> 04:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
there's different
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
um why don't you come
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay pull a chair up please
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:56.450 --> 04:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
so there are different rules when it
 
04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
comes to TANF and where they fall sorry
 
04:11:01.550 --> 04:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
there are different rules when it comes
 
04:11:03.170 --> 04:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
to tanup and where they fall in the
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
program that they fall in so um the
 
04:11:07.490 --> 04:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
program that they would fall in when it
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
comes to the bill that you're looking at
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
is redefining specified relative so a
 
04:11:15.290 --> 04:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
relative when they apply for TANF is
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for what's called Fab cash
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
which is Tana but it is a program that
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
is for individuals who are relatives who
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
are caring for another relative so not a
 
04:11:29.809 --> 04:11:29.819 align:start position:0%
parent so those five-year laws and rules
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
are for a different kind of TANF so the
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill that you're looking at is the
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
specified relative piece of the
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
caretaker relative part which is falls
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
under tanith under the fat program so
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's why when you're looking at the
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill it's very specific to relatives who
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
receive TANF and not parents who
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
received Tana right okay that defines it
 
04:11:51.650 --> 04:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:54.110 --> 04:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the assembled
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
panel representative McMahon
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
yes Ms marches and then also the
 
04:12:04.250 --> 04:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
Madame attorney next to you there
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify does this require uh
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know reading the bill and the
 
04:12:10.250 --> 04:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
implied that there'll be no problem with
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
this but does it require a CMS appeal
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.769 --> 04:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
no okay and just to follow up follow up
 
04:12:24.170 --> 04:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
and just going back to my years of doing
 
04:12:26.330 --> 04:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
this through Health and Human Services
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
was since there's an additional spending
 
04:12:28.439 --> 04:12:29.689 align:start position:0%
was since there's an additional spending
component

04:12:29.689 --> 04:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
component
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
it does not require that adjustment of
 
04:12:35.150 --> 04:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
this the split between federal and state
 
04:12:37.849 --> 04:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
to have an appeal process that could get
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
in the way of this being effectuated
 
04:12:42.290 --> 04:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
immediately I mean within the context of
 
04:12:42.300 --> 04:12:45.530 align:start position:0%
immediately I mean within the context of
timing

04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
so can you just say that sorry say can
 
04:12:49.729 --> 04:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
you say it one more time just what you
 
04:12:51.410 --> 04:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
just said I'll put it in different ways
 
04:12:53.150 --> 04:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
who's got the money
 
04:12:56.090 --> 04:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
so it's not a new program it's part of
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
the the the the program that already
 
04:13:00.769 --> 04:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
exists and so for that group again for
 
04:13:02.090 --> 04:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
relatives who care for their
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
grandchildren or their their nephew or
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
niece that funding is 100 federally
 
04:13:10.610 --> 04:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
funded so that's why all we're doing is
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
changing the terminology of who is
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
allowed to be a specified relative which
 
04:13:17.570 --> 04:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
now includes a court appointed Guardian
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
so that's why the funding we're not
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
asking for a different kind of funding
 
04:13:22.969 --> 04:13:22.979 align:start position:0%
source or
 
04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
um changing TANF per se as adding a
 
04:13:29.150 --> 04:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
different program we're just redefining
 
04:13:32.210 --> 04:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
who we are saying are caretaker
 
04:13:32.220 --> 04:13:35.290 align:start position:0%
who we are saying are caretaker
relatives

04:13:35.290 --> 04:13:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.490 --> 04:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
just going from the fiscal know where
 
04:13:41.150 --> 04:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
where it's referring to 2.1 million uh
 
04:13:43.969 --> 04:13:43.979 align:start position:0%
that money and and I'm I'm obviously for
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
this it's going back when dealing with
 
04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
disability issues and the funding and
 
04:13:48.530 --> 04:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
In-Home Care
 
04:13:51.650 --> 04:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
that a bureaucratic a faceless
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat from Washington will not get
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
in the way of this moving forward so
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
your guidance is in that regard no cons
 
04:14:03.889 --> 04:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.290 --> 04:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
you do not believe so or if you actually
 
04:14:08.830 --> 04:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
stand behind your words
 
04:14:08.840 --> 04:14:10.570 align:start position:0%
stand behind your words
oh

04:14:10.570 --> 04:14:10.580 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:14:17.570 --> 04:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.610 --> 04:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm hoping to avoid an appeal we
 
04:14:22.429 --> 04:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I believe
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
that what you're referring to may be
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
with respect to the tan of
 
04:14:32.450 --> 04:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
reauthorization by Congress and uh
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
there's no information available that
 
04:14:37.610 --> 04:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
would indicate that there would not be
 
04:14:39.530 --> 04:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
reauthorized but I think that we're all
 
04:14:41.809 --> 04:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
subjected to the entiretana program
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to that
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
right and they'll just close with one
 
04:14:48.530 --> 04:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
more Mr chairman bring it home thank you
 
04:14:50.450 --> 04:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
for your continued support indeed sir
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the uh knowing what the Millers have
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
just spoke of and I would not want want
 
04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
them to be disappointed and then the
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
expectation of helping with their
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
funding is there anything further you
 
04:15:02.450 --> 04:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we could do as
 
04:15:02.460 --> 04:15:04.250 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we could do as
legislators

04:15:04.250 --> 04:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
in whatever way you would uh seem
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to ensure that this does
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
happen and it might happen that if it's
 
04:15:14.570 --> 04:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
going to happen when is this fully in
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
blacklet of law that the money comes to
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sure so it's in the budget
 
04:15:23.450 --> 04:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and within the budget as well we have
 
04:15:25.729 --> 04:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
asked for an increase to the maintenance
 
04:15:28.969 --> 04:15:28.979 align:start position:0%
of effort for that particular budget so
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
in order to receive 32 million dollars
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
in federal funding to support the TANF
 
04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
program we actually 38 million excuse me
 
04:15:40.010 --> 04:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
we have to come up with 32 million in
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort which is General
 
04:15:45.889 --> 04:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
funds and expend that so because of
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
concerns in the budget in order to meet
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
that requirement we have asked for right
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
now in hb2 it it reads two and a half
 
04:15:59.450 --> 04:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars to include in the
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort to ensure that we
 
04:16:03.650 --> 04:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
do receive these federal funds so I
 
04:16:06.050 --> 04:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
think I would just ask that uh for that
 
04:16:08.210 --> 04:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
kind of support when the budget goes
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
through its process
 
04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:16:14.090 --> 04:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you distinguished panel
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.849 --> 04:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
and with that I closed the hearing on
 
04:16:33.849 --> 04:16:33.859 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
172 and in consultation with my vice
 
04:16:40.150 --> 04:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
chair ranking member
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
you think we ought to go forward with
 
04:16:46.250 --> 04:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
this about right now and give the Senate
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
to the hat-trick I agree okay open the
 
04:16:54.410 --> 04:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
exact session on Senate Bill 172 just a
 
04:16:56.929 --> 04:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
reminder that
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
um whoever makes the motion writes the
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
blurb and I will expect you to use the
 
04:17:04.250 --> 04:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
word fictive at least once in your
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
report so with that in mind who would
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%

04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:18.660 align:start position:0%

uh objection to consent calendar of

04:18:59.399 --> 04:19:02.030 align:start position:0%
course not we all voted for it what's
that

04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
it has a fiscal note but is that New
 
04:19:07.010 --> 04:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire money in the fiscal note or
 
04:19:07.020 --> 04:19:08.570 align:start position:0%

fed

04:19:08.570 --> 04:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
fed
 
04:19:10.729 --> 04:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go for consent they can
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
always say no I'm not going to say no
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
for them
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
okay but good point good good
 
04:19:18.410 --> 04:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
observation and this ends
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
the exact session on Senate Bill 172 and
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
I think we have one more report I have
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
seen mine obviously representative
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
panics there's one more due from
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
Grossmont yeah
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
so we have a just a little bit less than
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
45 minutes before the Judiciary
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
Committee joins us and a bunch of judges
 
04:19:48.170 --> 04:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
and for our continuing education session
 
04:19:50.210 --> 04:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
learn the word fictive committee it's a
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.840 --> 04:20:13.630 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
you know we couldn't get the millions
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call to order this
 
05:03:10.490 --> 05:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
continuing education event for the
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee
 
05:03:18.650 --> 05:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
we found that some of the bills that
 
05:03:21.250 --> 05:03:21.260 align:start position:0%
have come before us having to do with
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
the law or the Judiciary Committee we're
 
05:03:29.090 --> 05:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time sometimes there
 
05:03:32.448 --> 05:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
were misuses of legal terms sometimes
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
the rules of Criminal Court were soon to
 
05:03:38.208 --> 05:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
be the same as the rules for civil court
 
05:03:42.288 --> 05:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
and so on and I got to thinking if we
 
05:03:45.770 --> 05:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
had a continuing education event and
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
brought senior senior Judiciary people
 
05:03:52.550 --> 05:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
to us they could make a presentation to
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
us and we would learn some more things
 
05:03:57.170 --> 05:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
about the law so next time our bills
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
would have a greater chance of being
 
05:04:02.410 --> 05:04:02.420 align:start position:0%
heard and not either killed or retained
 
05:04:04.850 --> 05:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
here's the format for how we're going to
 
05:04:06.610 --> 05:04:06.620 align:start position:0%
be working today
 
05:04:10.730 --> 05:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary folks will introduce
 
05:04:13.250 --> 05:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
themselves and make a presentation
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
if along the way you have a question
 
05:04:20.330 --> 05:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
you will go over to the table where the
 
05:04:24.050 --> 05:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
committee researcher is
 
05:04:24.060 --> 05:04:25.490 align:start position:0%
committee researcher is
waving

05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
waving
 
05:04:28.730 --> 05:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
cards at you and her hand too
 
05:04:31.850 --> 05:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
and you will fill out the question on
 
05:04:33.770 --> 05:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
the card we will not take questions from
 
05:04:35.930 --> 05:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
the audience in a direct verbal way
 
05:04:38.090 --> 05:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
you'll fill the cards out and there's a
 
05:04:39.890 --> 05:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
box where you'll put them in
 
05:04:42.250 --> 05:04:42.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Lynn
 
05:04:49.550 --> 05:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
will pick up a pile of those cards and
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
sort them by type because many of the
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
questions will be similar to other
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
questions so we'll group them or he'll
 
05:04:59.930 --> 05:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
group them so that we can ask one
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
composite question
 
05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
it's not proper to raise a question
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
about a particular court case
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
first of all because that is considered
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
unethical in a case like we're in today
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
secondly the justices may not be
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with it and thirdly we're not
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking at particular cases we're
 
05:05:26.090 --> 05:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
looking at process what is the process
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
is it being followed should there be a
 
05:05:31.550 --> 05:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
different process what is the procedure
 
05:05:34.570 --> 05:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of broad questions
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
that can be put to the justices
 
05:05:42.170 --> 05:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
now in a meeting with chairman Lynn and
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
the justices I came to the belief that
 
05:05:50.690 --> 05:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
they are coming both to explain but also
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
to listen
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
and there will be some things where I
 
05:05:56.930 --> 05:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
know I'll learn a lot I made assumptions
 
05:05:58.970 --> 05:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
that were incorrect
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
but they're also going to hear some of
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
the many concerns that people have
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
raised and until he proved to me
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think they're going to do
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
something about it and as I told them
 
05:06:14.930 --> 05:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
those are the nice carrots the stick I
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
have in my back pocket is several
 
05:06:19.610 --> 05:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
retained bills that are really
 
05:06:23.090 --> 05:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
trying to straighten out Judiciary so
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
I've got that stick I don't think I'll
 
05:06:25.788 --> 05:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
need it
 
05:06:28.970 --> 05:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
but I got it so now that I've pretty
 
05:06:31.730 --> 05:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
well alienated everybody in the room
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
I will call upon the Chief Justice sir
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
if you would introduce yourself and your
 
05:06:36.120 --> 05:06:37.368 align:start position:0%
if you would introduce yourself and your
colleagues

05:06:37.368 --> 05:06:37.378 align:start position:0%
colleagues

05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
the Committees some statistics relating
 
05:07:43.610 --> 05:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
to the Family Division and judge Gardner
 
05:07:46.850 --> 05:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
who uh is very well versed in this area
 
05:07:49.368 --> 05:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
of the law and the procedures prepared
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
to help the committee and members of the
 
05:07:54.170 --> 05:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
public with questions relating to that
 
05:07:56.208 --> 05:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
so we are very grateful for the
 
05:07:58.550 --> 05:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity I do want to reiterate what
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
the chair said we want to hear comments
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
we want to hear feedback as public
 
05:08:08.690 --> 05:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
officials that's our duty and if we can
 
05:08:10.970 --> 05:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
do better we want to do better
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
and it is in that spirit that we are
 
05:08:12.958 --> 05:08:14.390 align:start position:0%
and it is in that spirit that we are
here

05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh I do have slides and I've distributed
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think every member of the committee's
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
has them uh so I've covered slide two uh
 
05:08:26.330 --> 05:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
Chief uh would it be possible if we have
 
05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
some left over we keep a few for
 
05:08:30.770 --> 05:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
committee members who aren't here but
 
05:08:33.530 --> 05:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
those particularly in the audience who
 
05:08:37.250 --> 05:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
are house members and Bill writers might
 
05:08:39.970 --> 05:08:39.980 align:start position:0%
have access and
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
maybe the way they're distributed people
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
could look on with one another
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you sir okay slide number three is
 
05:08:51.890 --> 05:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
our mission and it is something that we
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
take very very seriously and we try to
 
05:08:56.930 --> 05:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
live by every day and that goes through
 
05:08:59.570 --> 05:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
before not just the judges but our 800
 
05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
employees in the judicial branch
 
05:09:04.250 --> 05:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
the next slide just gives you a visual
 
05:09:06.890 --> 05:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
overview of the judicial branch we are
 
05:09:08.570 --> 05:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
comprised of two trial courts the
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
circuit court and the Superior Court one
 
05:09:13.730 --> 05:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court the Supreme Court and
 
05:09:17.330 --> 05:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
one office that provides administrative
 
05:09:19.730 --> 05:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
support for the Judiciary it's called
 
05:09:21.590 --> 05:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the courts
 
05:09:23.930 --> 05:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to detail or judge king
 
05:09:26.208 --> 05:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
and I will detail each one of these
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
courts just to level set everyone and I
 
05:09:30.948 --> 05:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
recognize in advance that for many of
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
you this is uh you're well versed in
 
05:09:35.628 --> 05:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
this but I want to just make sure we're
 
05:09:37.730 --> 05:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh circuit court judge king
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief so I'm on slide six and
 
05:09:47.090 --> 05:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh by way a review for some of you and
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
maybe new for others the Circuit Court
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
was created uh with an effective date of
 
05:09:55.970 --> 05:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2011 by this body it's a
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
legislatively created court and at the
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
time we were under some fairly we the
 
05:10:03.650 --> 05:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire running some
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
fairly tight budget times and we were
 
05:10:09.050 --> 05:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
asked to get creative and see if there
 
05:10:09.890 --> 05:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
are ways that we could create
 
05:10:12.170 --> 05:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for the state in the court
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
system and what we did at the time was
 
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
we took three limited jurisdiction
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
courts we took the district court the
 
05:10:22.430 --> 05:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
Probate Court where I came from and the
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
Family Division and we collapsed them
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
into one court and we called it the
 
05:10:27.770 --> 05:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court we just kind of pulled
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
that name out of the air I said we
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
called it the circuit court because
 
05:10:32.330 --> 05:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court was already taken so we
 
05:10:34.190 --> 05:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
needed to come up with something so we
 
05:10:37.490 --> 05:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
called it the circuit court and the bill
 
05:10:40.970 --> 05:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
was introduced in January of 2011 and I
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
think Governor Lynch signed it in
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
mid-may it was one of the biggest
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
changes in the court system since the
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
consolidation in 1983 which was House
 
05:10:53.570 --> 05:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
Bill 200 back then I was a member of
 
05:10:56.208 --> 05:10:56.218 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary in the 8384 session
 
05:10:58.610 --> 05:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
which I was shocked to do the math today
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
was 40 years ago but we when we created
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court it was House Bill 609
 
05:11:07.610 --> 05:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
and we had asked the legislature for 10
 
05:11:10.128 --> 05:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
years to implement it so that we could
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
do the restructuring by attrition and we
 
05:11:15.170 --> 05:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
were told that we had to implement it by
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
July 1st so we did we went from 115
 
05:11:20.690 --> 05:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
clerks and deputies across those three
 
05:11:23.448 --> 05:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
courts down to 52
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
clerks and deputies we brought all those
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
folks into a room and we said we're
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
going to post 52 jobs you're all free to
 
05:11:31.970 --> 05:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
apply but basically half of you are
 
05:11:33.050 --> 05:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
going to lose your jobs and it was
 
05:11:34.010 --> 05:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most difficult
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
things I've done in court administration
 
05:11:40.030 --> 05:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
and so and at the time we had 45
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
full-time judicial officers on the bench
 
05:11:45.288 --> 05:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
across those three courts which included
 
05:11:49.010 --> 05:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
13 marital Masters and today there's
 
05:11:51.170 --> 05:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
only one of those left and it's me the
 
05:11:54.650 --> 05:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
rest are the other 44 judges and Masters
 
05:11:57.170 --> 05:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
have retired summer some Masters are now
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
judges like judge Garner some part-time
 
05:12:01.850 --> 05:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
judges have become full-time judges but
 
05:12:05.090 --> 05:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
of those 45 judicial officers 44 are no
 
05:12:07.788 --> 05:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
longer on the bench
 
05:12:12.288 --> 05:12:12.298 align:start position:0%
slide seven uh it was no mystery to the
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
creation of this we created 10 circuits
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
and each County was a circuit and we
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to change as little as
 
05:12:21.170 --> 05:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
possible uh to try to get this through
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
the legislature as seamlessly as we
 
05:12:25.368 --> 05:12:25.378 align:start position:0%
could so we have 34 Circuit Court
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
locations around the state they're all
 
05:12:30.530 --> 05:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
depicted on this map we have 10 probate
 
05:12:32.570 --> 05:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
divisions those were the where the
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
probate courts were originally
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
established in the county seats and now
 
05:12:38.930 --> 05:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
we have a district Division and a Family
 
05:12:41.410 --> 05:12:41.420 align:start position:0%
Division and all of the other 31
 
05:12:44.090 --> 05:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
locations since we created the Circuit
 
05:12:46.730 --> 05:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
Court we've closed plasta which was a
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
really small Court down in the lower
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
part of the part of the state
 
05:12:54.530 --> 05:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
slide 8 gives you what we're using as a
 
05:12:58.368 --> 05:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
an annual circuit court case volume and
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
because of the covid-19 pandemic and a
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
pretty significant reduction in
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
many different case types we have used
 
05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
the average of fiscal years 17 18 and 19
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
but using those years the circuit court
 
05:13:18.410 --> 05:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
case volume is over 126 000 cases a year
 
05:13:20.810 --> 05:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we have a number of
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
cases that are reopened and just in the
 
05:13:26.930 --> 05:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting world that's another 3
 
05:13:30.350 --> 05:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
700 to 5400 cases a year that get added
 
05:13:32.750 --> 05:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
to our dockets
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
on the next slide uh what we show the
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
number of Circuit Court judges and the
 
05:13:40.368 --> 05:13:40.378 align:start position:0%
chief will explain the weighted caseload
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
study but currently as of today we have
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
41 full-time judges on the bench we have
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
one full-time vacancy and we actually
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
have five part-time judges because judge
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
Maloney just turned 70 and she's now a
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
referee in addition to that we have
 
05:14:00.410 --> 05:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
four senior active judges that we use
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
from time to time who can work part-time
 
05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
those are Judges who have retired but
 
05:14:07.368 --> 05:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
are still under the age of 70. we have
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
one marital master who is retired who
 
05:14:09.600 --> 05:14:10.490 align:start position:0%
one marital master who is retired who
still

05:14:10.490 --> 05:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:14:14.208 --> 05:14:14.218 align:start position:0%
sits occasionally and we have 12
 
05:14:16.730 --> 05:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
retired judges who are over the age of
 
05:14:20.570 --> 05:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
70 that we still need in order to try to
 
05:14:22.368 --> 05:14:22.378 align:start position:0%
meet the caseload that we have because
 
05:14:24.590 --> 05:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
we just don't have enough judges so 12
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
judges over age 70 who are regularly
 
05:14:31.070 --> 05:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
hearing cases as senior referees and
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
everything that that they do has to be
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
co-signed by a judge so it's not a real
 
05:14:37.730 --> 05:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
efficient use but we schedule in the
 
05:14:40.250 --> 05:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court by judge days
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
so if you take those 126 000 cases using
 
05:14:46.850 --> 05:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
the weighted caseload that translates to
 
05:14:51.410 --> 05:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
16 352 judge days that we need to move
 
05:14:54.170 --> 05:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
the volume of cases that we have
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
for this year calendar year 2023 when we
 
05:14:58.850 --> 05:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
put the judicial schedule together
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
we were able to Cobble together ten
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and eighteen days
 
05:15:05.410 --> 05:15:05.420 align:start position:0%
so that's all of the full-time judges
 
05:15:08.448 --> 05:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
that's the part-time judges we have five
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
part-time judges they sit anywhere from
 
05:15:15.410 --> 05:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
a handful of days up to a couple hundred
 
05:15:16.910 --> 05:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
days they tell us how many they are
 
05:15:19.070 --> 05:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
willing to do when we try to add a few
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
more to that
 
05:15:22.490 --> 05:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
and then we take the senior active
 
05:15:25.850 --> 05:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
judges and the referees War over 70 and
 
05:15:28.850 --> 05:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
that all of those all in added up to ten
 
05:15:30.350 --> 05:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and eighteen days
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
so you can see we're we're thousands of
 
05:15:35.570 --> 05:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
days short of scheduling what we need to
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.448 --> 05:15:44.458 align:start position:0%
our other trial court is the superior
 
05:15:47.810 --> 05:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
court if you go to page 11 it's a brief
 
05:15:49.550 --> 05:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
description of the jurisdiction of the
 
05:15:51.530 --> 05:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
Superior Court it is our court of
 
05:15:54.350 --> 05:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
General jurisdiction it is the only
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
Court in our state which has conducts
 
05:15:58.128 --> 05:15:58.138 align:start position:0%
jury trials
 
05:16:02.570 --> 05:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh it it has uh jurisdiction over all
 
05:16:05.868 --> 05:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
felony crimes and all civil matters over
 
05:16:08.208 --> 05:16:08.218 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars so a very
 
05:16:08.218 --> 05:16:09.288 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars so a very
wide

05:16:09.288 --> 05:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
wide
 
05:16:12.288 --> 05:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
uh range of jurisdiction on the next
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
slide you will see what
 
05:16:18.050 --> 05:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sure is very familiar we have 11
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
Superior Court locations in New
 
05:16:20.100 --> 05:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
Superior Court locations in New
Hampshire

05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
one in each County two in Hillsboro in
 
05:16:27.530 --> 05:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester in Nashua
 
05:16:30.770 --> 05:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
on slide 13 you will see the analog to
 
05:16:33.050 --> 05:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
what you saw in slide 8 with the Circuit
 
05:16:33.060 --> 05:16:33.890 align:start position:0%
what you saw in slide 8 with the Circuit
Court

05:16:33.890 --> 05:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
Court
 
05:16:37.810 --> 05:16:37.820 align:start position:0%
about 18 000 cases in superior court
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
over the same period of time that judge
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
king described and you can see the
 
05:16:46.490 --> 05:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
breakdown in the um in the in the
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
graphic the largest cohort of cases are
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
the next slide you will see our head
 
05:16:57.410 --> 05:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
count in Superior Court it has remained
 
05:17:01.190 --> 05:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
unchanged uh since at least 2011 we have
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
21 authorized judges and one chief
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
justice currently we were fully
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
accounted for in terms of judges no
 
05:17:14.930 --> 05:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:17.448 --> 05:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
so those are our true trial courts we
 
05:17:19.128 --> 05:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
have one Appellate Court in New
 
05:17:21.288 --> 05:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is the Supreme Court
 
05:17:24.170 --> 05:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court sits here in Concord and
 
05:17:26.410 --> 05:17:26.420 align:start position:0%
on page 16
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
you will see the justices of the Supreme
 
05:17:31.330 --> 05:17:31.340 align:start position:0%
Court there are four associate justices
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
and one chief justice
 
05:17:38.930 --> 05:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
in addition to our duties and as
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
appellate judges we serve as leaders of
 
05:17:45.170 --> 05:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and the Chief
 
05:17:47.090 --> 05:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
Justice in particular has administrative
 
05:17:50.410 --> 05:17:50.420 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the judicial branch
 
05:17:53.410 --> 05:17:53.420 align:start position:0%
our duties include
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
overseeing issues such as attorney
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
discipline attorney emissions liaison
 
05:18:00.050 --> 05:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Bar Association
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
and development of court rules
 
05:18:06.288 --> 05:18:06.298 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide 17 you will see
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
our breakdown of cases it's about
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
625 650 cases a year of that about
 
05:18:19.850 --> 05:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
150 125 to 150 at uh receive full-blown
 
05:18:22.970 --> 05:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
oral arguments and and decisions that
 
05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
are reported in the New Hampshire
 
05:18:26.570 --> 05:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
reports I just came from a day of oral
 
05:18:29.448 --> 05:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
argument to be over here we hold them
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
about four times four to six times a
 
05:18:31.798 --> 05:18:32.708 align:start position:0%
about four times four to six times a
month

05:18:32.708 --> 05:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:18:36.350 --> 05:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of our cases are all
 
05:18:39.650 --> 05:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
handled their five sets of eyes on every
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
single case that runs through our court
 
05:18:44.330 --> 05:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're just disposed of in various
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
different ways including by orders and
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:52.128 --> 05:18:52.138 align:start position:0%
on the next slide uh we are supported by
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the courts
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
about 55 people who work there their
 
05:19:00.010 --> 05:19:00.020 align:start position:0%
location is over at one Granite place
 
05:19:03.410 --> 05:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
and they they provide support in terms
 
05:19:05.930 --> 05:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology Human
 
05:19:09.770 --> 05:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
Resources legal government relations
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
that are back office support
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
and it's a fairly complex organization
 
05:19:19.850 --> 05:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
as you've seen in our slides we have
 
05:19:22.030 --> 05:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
over 40 locations around New Hampshire
 
05:19:28.368 --> 05:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:33.170 --> 05:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
so let's begin uh the discussion of
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
what what is called the weighted
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
caseload study and if you turn to page
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
or slide 20
 
05:19:40.320 --> 05:19:43.570 align:start position:0%
or slide 20
um

05:19:43.570 --> 05:19:43.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:47.208 --> 05:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
of two legislatures ago judge king can
 
05:19:49.930 --> 05:19:49.940 align:start position:0%
correct me uh this legislature
 
05:19:53.690 --> 05:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
authorized uh appropriated funds for us
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
to undertake a weighted caseload study a
 
05:19:59.230 --> 05:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study is an
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
evidence-based analysis of how many
 
05:20:07.128 --> 05:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
resources we need in terms of judges and
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
case processing staff given our case
 
05:20:10.798 --> 05:20:11.930 align:start position:0%
case processing staff given our case
load

05:20:11.930 --> 05:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
load
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
in a way to caseload study is in
 
05:20:18.288 --> 05:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
contrast to other ways that that policy
 
05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
makers may decide how to assign judicial
 
05:20:20.700 --> 05:20:21.910 align:start position:0%
makers may decide how to assign judicial
resources

05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:20:25.730 --> 05:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
but we feel this is the best most
 
05:20:25.740 --> 05:20:26.948 align:start position:0%
but we feel this is the best most
reliable

05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
05:20:26.958 --> 05:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
reliable
evidence-based

05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
means to do it and our feeling is backed
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
up by legislation which was enacted in
 
05:20:36.480 --> 05:20:39.490 align:start position:0%
up by legislation which was enacted in
2005

05:20:39.490 --> 05:20:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.368 --> 05:20:43.378 align:start position:0%
which by which this legislature endorsed
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
away the caseload study one was
 
05:20:49.868 --> 05:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
conducted in 2005 and then
 
05:20:56.810 --> 05:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um slide 21 talks about other methods
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
that may be employed to determine how
 
05:21:03.610 --> 05:21:03.620 align:start position:0%
many judges and Court staff we need
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
population-based formulas for formal is
 
05:21:08.510 --> 05:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
based purely on the number of cases but
 
05:21:08.520 --> 05:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
based purely on the number of cases but
again

05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:21:13.250 --> 05:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
um in 490f Colon 11 this legislature has
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
endorsed a weighted caseload study
 
05:21:19.730 --> 05:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
on slide 22 I
 
05:21:22.610 --> 05:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
the basic methodology the basic approach
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
is to take the number of cases determine
 
05:21:28.368 --> 05:21:28.378 align:start position:0%
a case weight and then determine how
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
many resources measured in core
 
05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
personnel and judges are needed to make
 
05:21:35.570 --> 05:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
our workload
 
05:21:39.368 --> 05:21:39.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:41.930 --> 05:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
this is the history of our weighted
 
05:21:43.550 --> 05:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
caseload study in New Hampshire as I
 
05:21:46.850 --> 05:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned one was conducted in 2005 at
 
05:21:49.368 --> 05:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
the time the trial courts had 482
 
05:21:49.378 --> 05:21:50.590 align:start position:0%
the time the trial courts had 482
positions

05:21:50.590 --> 05:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:21:53.930 --> 05:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
in 2022 when we conducted this study
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
there were 514 positions
 
05:22:01.750 --> 05:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
do this study we on next slide
 
05:22:05.330 --> 05:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
slide 24 we retained the services of the
 
05:22:08.330 --> 05:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
national Center for state courts the
 
05:22:10.368 --> 05:22:10.378 align:start position:0%
national Center for state courts is an
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary resource which serves all
 
05:22:16.190 --> 05:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
State and territorial courts in our
 
05:22:16.200 --> 05:22:16.990 align:start position:0%
State and territorial courts in our
country

05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:22:20.390 --> 05:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
and they have substantial experience and
 
05:22:22.490 --> 05:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
expertise since in assisting
 
05:22:25.310 --> 05:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in doing way to caseload
 
05:22:28.430 --> 05:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
studies both poor judges and staff so we
 
05:22:30.410 --> 05:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
retained them to assist us with the
 
05:22:30.420 --> 05:22:32.090 align:start position:0%
retained them to assist us with the
study

05:22:32.090 --> 05:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
on the next slide slide 25
 
05:22:39.948 --> 05:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
you will see a basic methodology or
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
calculation for how a weighted caseload
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
is determined for one of our case types
 
05:22:50.208 --> 05:22:50.218 align:start position:0%
small claims are heard in the Circuit
 
05:22:50.218 --> 05:22:51.170 align:start position:0%
small claims are heard in the Circuit
Court

05:22:51.170 --> 05:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
Court
 
05:22:55.490 --> 05:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
and you can see that if you look at the
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
the chart on the right hand side of
 
05:22:59.330 --> 05:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
slide 25
 
05:23:03.170 --> 05:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
during our survey period which was six
 
05:23:05.708 --> 05:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
weeks at the beginning of last year
 
05:23:09.070 --> 05:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
judges uh
 
05:23:12.770 --> 05:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
recorded in court processing staff
 
05:23:16.850 --> 05:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
recorded 22 324 minutes
 
05:23:18.650 --> 05:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they worked on small claims
 
05:23:25.730 --> 05:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
cases there were 29 days of collection
 
05:23:29.230 --> 05:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
during this period you divide those two
 
05:23:32.690 --> 05:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
numbers and then multiply it by the
 
05:23:35.810 --> 05:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
number of judicial working days and you
 
05:23:37.970 --> 05:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
have the Statewide annualized minutes
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
for small claims cases
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
then you divide that
 
05:23:46.610 --> 05:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
by the number of court filings for small
 
05:23:51.410 --> 05:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
claims and you see that the case weight
 
05:23:55.090 --> 05:23:55.100 align:start position:0%
for this case type is 12.38 minutes
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
which means on average a judge spends
 
05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
12.38 minutes on a small claims case
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
now is my colleagues will explain that's
 
05:24:11.208 --> 05:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
an average I mean it's some or less some
 
05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
or more small claims cases can if
 
05:24:17.090 --> 05:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
they're if they're settled no no time is
 
05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
needed or recorded but that's the
 
05:24:22.490 --> 05:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
average and it this this slide is simply
 
05:24:24.288 --> 05:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate how we come up with a
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
weighted case
 
05:24:25.680 --> 05:24:29.208 align:start position:0%
weighted case
number

05:24:29.208 --> 05:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.218 --> 05:24:30.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:31.750 --> 05:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:24:35.090 --> 05:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
we needed data for each one of our case
 
05:24:39.770 --> 05:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
types and our staff and judges recorded
 
05:24:42.650 --> 05:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
the data as I said for 29 days at the
 
05:24:44.208 --> 05:24:44.218 align:start position:0%
beginning of last year
 
05:24:49.250 --> 05:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it was those that time that was the
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
essential data point that helped us
 
05:24:56.448 --> 05:24:56.458 align:start position:0%
build our conclusions
 
05:24:59.330 --> 05:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
and led to our conclusions on page slide
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
27 you will see our Baseline staff for
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
the way to caseload study at the time it
 
05:25:07.850 --> 05:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
was conducted
 
05:25:10.670 --> 05:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
broken down by judicial officers in
 
05:25:13.510 --> 05:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
various categories of staff
 
05:25:16.128 --> 05:25:16.138 align:start position:0%
on the circuit court side you will see
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
that there are 44.32
 
05:25:21.530 --> 05:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
judicial officers included in the study
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
at the time I just want you to footnote
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
that because we'll come back to it and
 
05:25:25.920 --> 05:25:28.090 align:start position:0%
that because we'll come back to it and
explain

05:25:28.090 --> 05:25:28.100 align:start position:0%
explain
 
05:25:30.650 --> 05:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
number a little bit more in the context
 
05:25:36.110 --> 05:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
on the next slide you will see that we
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
had extraordinary participation and
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
therefore highly reliable data we had a
 
05:25:47.390 --> 05:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
hundred percent participation by our
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
judges and our staff
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
over 29 days so in addition to doing
 
05:25:55.810 --> 05:25:55.820 align:start position:0%
performing their day-to-day function
 
05:25:58.730 --> 05:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
functions and serving the people of our
 
05:26:00.590 --> 05:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
state in our court system they were
 
05:26:02.930 --> 05:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
recording the time on each one of the
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
on slide 29 we summarize the results
 
05:26:12.360 --> 05:26:14.930 align:start position:0%
on slide 29 we summarize the results
um

05:26:14.930 --> 05:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:20.110 --> 05:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
the national Center found that we needed
 
05:26:20.120 --> 05:26:22.510 align:start position:0%
the national Center found that we needed
536

05:26:22.510 --> 05:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
536
 
05:26:25.550 --> 05:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
563.77 judicial officers and staff to
 
05:26:27.230 --> 05:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
process cases
 
05:26:30.530 --> 05:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
in both of our trial courts and that's
 
05:26:34.190 --> 05:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
about 50 more positions than in our
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
and of those broken down the Circuit
 
05:26:42.288 --> 05:26:42.298 align:start position:0%
Court needs were identified as an
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
additional 37 positions in Superior
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
Court an additional 12 positions both
 
05:26:58.250 --> 05:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:01.010 --> 05:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
I want to if we could just go out of
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
order skip to slide 31.
 
05:27:08.050 --> 05:27:08.060 align:start position:0%
in addition the study
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
tried to capture a very important data
 
05:27:13.368 --> 05:27:13.378 align:start position:0%
source which is the reality in both of
 
05:27:18.050 --> 05:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
our trial courts is that clerks Deputy
 
05:27:20.990 --> 05:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
clerks and other managers are actually
 
05:27:23.090 --> 05:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
doing the work of our court Assistance
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
or core process our case processing
 
05:27:25.440 --> 05:27:26.448 align:start position:0%
or core process our case processing
staff

05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:27:29.330 --> 05:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
and you can see that across both trial
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
courts that
 
05:27:35.208 --> 05:27:35.218 align:start position:0%
work that's impounded in our clerks and
 
05:27:37.850 --> 05:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
our Deputy clerks that should be with
 
05:27:40.868 --> 05:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
court processing staff amounts to
 
05:27:43.610 --> 05:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
57.3 positions in both of our trial
 
05:27:46.368 --> 05:27:46.378 align:start position:0%
courts broken down by about 40 in the
 
05:27:50.208 --> 05:27:50.218 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court in 17 and a half in the
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the numbers that we
 
05:27:58.970 --> 05:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
saw on page 29 these are also the
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
reality of what we're dealing with we
 
05:28:02.930 --> 05:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
have clerks and Deputy clerks who are
 
05:28:05.090 --> 05:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
who are doing case processing work and
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's a key data point that we're able
 
05:28:10.070 --> 05:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:12.650 --> 05:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
on page 30
 
05:28:12.660 --> 05:28:14.150 align:start position:0%
on page 30
um

05:28:14.150 --> 05:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:19.330 --> 05:28:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:22.190 --> 05:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
the basic conclusions of the national
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
centers work for us which in the Circuit
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
Court in terms of judges
 
05:28:29.638 --> 05:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
Court in terms of judges
um

05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:31.200 --> 05:28:32.750 align:start position:0%
um
we

05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:28:32.760 --> 05:28:33.970 align:start position:0%
we
require

05:28:33.970 --> 05:28:33.980 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:28:37.610 --> 05:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
21.35 additional judges
 
05:28:39.530 --> 05:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
but I want you to footnote that we'll
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
come back to it and you can see the
 
05:28:43.970 --> 05:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
breakdown among staff in Superior Court
 
05:28:46.310 --> 05:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
three and a half new judges
 
05:28:49.250 --> 05:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
and for the most part additional staff
 
05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
so page 32 I'm going to ask judge king
 
05:29:07.628 --> 05:29:07.638 align:start position:0%
to explain this
 
05:29:13.310 --> 05:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
page 32 level sets the the number of
 
05:29:13.320 --> 05:29:15.288 align:start position:0%
page 32 level sets the the number of
judges

05:29:15.288 --> 05:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
judges
 
05:29:18.770 --> 05:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
that the national Center identified with
 
05:29:21.530 --> 05:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
the reality of judicial resources
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
available to us because the national
 
05:29:28.128 --> 05:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
Center did not capture the work of some
 
05:29:30.470 --> 05:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
of our per diem or of our per diem
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
judges and this chart explains
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
explains that
 
05:29:40.490 --> 05:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
so this page actually shows what we had
 
05:29:42.890 --> 05:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
available to us at the during that six
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
week period of data collection on the
 
05:29:47.330 --> 05:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
ground in the circuit court so we had at
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
that time 40 full-time judges we still
 
05:29:52.368 --> 05:29:52.378 align:start position:0%
had one marital Master we had a
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
full-time child support referee which
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
was counted as a judge a part-time child
 
05:29:58.970 --> 05:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
support referee
 
05:30:01.970 --> 05:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
and then we have we had two we now have
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
one holdover salaried district court
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
judges so these were judges that were
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
appointed before the Circuit Court was
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
created were appointed to a specific
 
05:30:13.010 --> 05:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
court for example the Portsmouth
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
District Court they are still considered
 
05:30:18.650 --> 05:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
a salary judge and they received the
 
05:30:21.650 --> 05:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
salary by Statute for that Court to
 
05:30:24.050 --> 05:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
which they were appointed until they
 
05:30:25.730 --> 05:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
retire or they turned 70. that's just
 
05:30:27.770 --> 05:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
unless they become a full-time judge so
 
05:30:29.990 --> 05:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of a one-off for us we
 
05:30:31.430 --> 05:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
have to take the weighted caseload for
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
that court and then do the math and
 
05:30:36.110 --> 05:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's how their salaries are calculated
 
05:30:36.120 --> 05:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
that's how their salaries are calculated
um

05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
and then there were adjustments made to
 
05:30:41.690 --> 05:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
that for
 
05:30:41.700 --> 05:30:44.510 align:start position:0%
that for
um

05:30:44.510 --> 05:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.970 --> 05:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
there were two authorized full-time
 
05:30:49.250 --> 05:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
judges in addition to that one marital
 
05:30:52.010 --> 05:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
Master had retired and one of the two
 
05:30:55.128 --> 05:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
salary judges had retired and we added a
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
full-time probate referee just about
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
exactly when we were doing the study
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
which was authorized by the legislature
 
05:31:04.730 --> 05:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
to be able to process our electronically
 
05:31:07.730 --> 05:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
filed Estates thereby kind of freeing up
 
05:31:10.970 --> 05:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
a judge from doing that work
 
05:31:12.890 --> 05:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
and if you get to the bottom line that
 
05:31:24.010 --> 05:31:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.170 --> 05:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
so one on slide 30 the national Center
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
had identified
 
05:31:32.750 --> 05:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
21.35 additional judges once you true it
 
05:31:36.288 --> 05:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
up the real number as as judge king just
 
05:31:39.850 --> 05:31:39.860 align:start position:0%
explained that the number is
 
05:31:43.850 --> 05:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
17.32 additional judges needed that is
 
05:31:45.288 --> 05:31:45.298 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of the study in the
 
05:31:47.810 --> 05:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court three and a half judges in
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to ask both of my
 
05:31:56.690 --> 05:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
colleagues if they want to explain what
 
05:32:01.810 --> 05:32:01.820 align:start position:0%
the consequences of not having adequate
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
inadequate number of judges in court
 
05:32:07.010 --> 05:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
processing staff are in terms of the
 
05:32:10.550 --> 05:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
reality of their the caseload in circuit
 
05:32:13.850 --> 05:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
court and basically how cases are
 
05:32:13.860 --> 05:32:16.368 align:start position:0%
court and basically how cases are
triaged

05:32:16.368 --> 05:32:16.378 align:start position:0%
triaged
 
05:32:18.730 --> 05:32:18.740 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'll take a stab at that Chief
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier in my comments the
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload
 
05:32:28.970 --> 05:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
calls for 16 352
 
05:32:33.890 --> 05:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
judge days for 2023 to move the number
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
of cases and we we can break that down
 
05:32:40.128 --> 05:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
by case type but there are a lot of
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
cases that this legislature has told us
 
05:32:45.530 --> 05:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
have to be resolved in certain time
 
05:32:48.288 --> 05:32:48.298 align:start position:0%
frames so our landlord tenant cases our
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect cases our juvenile
 
05:32:52.730 --> 05:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
delinquency cases some guardianship
 
05:32:57.708 --> 05:32:57.718 align:start position:0%
cases civil protection orders uh chins
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights that's a
 
05:33:02.930 --> 05:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
big chunk of what we do and even during
 
05:33:06.770 --> 05:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic we were required
 
05:33:09.288 --> 05:33:09.298 align:start position:0%
by Statute to get those cases resolved
 
05:33:10.970 --> 05:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the time frames that you set for us
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we were able to do that we didn't
 
05:33:14.330 --> 05:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
miss a deadline we had some exceptions
 
05:33:17.448 --> 05:33:17.458 align:start position:0%
for landlord tenant by Court rule
 
05:33:21.650 --> 05:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
um but there are a number of cases that
 
05:33:23.810 --> 05:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
there just are not enough judges on the
 
05:33:27.530 --> 05:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
bench to get to and those are the cases
 
05:33:28.490 --> 05:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
that you're hearing from your
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
constituents that aren't moving as
 
05:33:32.570 --> 05:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
quickly as they should and we do not
 
05:33:35.868 --> 05:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
dispute that they are absolutely right
 
05:33:38.448 --> 05:33:38.458 align:start position:0%
um there are criminal cases that involve
 
05:33:40.850 --> 05:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
non-incarcerated defendants that it's
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
taking longer than we would like to get
 
05:33:45.050 --> 05:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
scheduled for trial and certainly in the
 
05:33:47.448 --> 05:33:47.458 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting Arena we're not
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
getting to those cases nearly as quickly
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
as we would like those are the kinds of
 
05:33:53.570 --> 05:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
cases that don't have statutorily
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
dictated deadlines and so we triage the
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
cases that we have to reach and there's
 
05:34:00.650 --> 05:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
got to be some slippage somewhere and
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's primarily in non-incarcerated
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
defendants small claims in civil cases
 
05:34:08.930 --> 05:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
and in the divorce parenting cases in
 
05:34:11.150 --> 05:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
order to meet our deadlines we would
 
05:34:12.650 --> 05:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
need the judges that the weighted
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
caseload study says that we need so I
 
05:34:17.090 --> 05:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
think I'm really proud that our judges
 
05:34:19.490 --> 05:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
are doing as well as they are doing they
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
work nights and weekends to try to stay
 
05:34:23.770 --> 05:34:23.780 align:start position:0%
on top of things but there is definitely
 
05:34:27.410 --> 05:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
a gap and we are not reaching the time
 
05:34:29.750 --> 05:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
to disposition in all of our cases in
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
the fashion that we would like to or
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
being perfectly upfront about that I've
 
05:34:35.690 --> 05:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
talked to both chairman about that and
 
05:34:38.330 --> 05:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's not a mystery
 
05:34:40.190 --> 05:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
judge Garner can probably talk about how
 
05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:48.650 --> 05:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
so I was here a couple of months ago I
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
think to be introduced to the children
 
05:34:53.150 --> 05:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
and family law section it's nice of you
 
05:34:54.770 --> 05:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
to have me back again I'm glad to be
 
05:34:55.810 --> 05:34:55.820 align:start position:0%
back again
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
just by way of introduction I'm a
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge I've been a judge
 
05:35:02.208 --> 05:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
for about seven years I sit in Laconia
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
almost all of the time
 
05:35:08.208 --> 05:35:08.218 align:start position:0%
and I'm as a circuit court judge trained
 
05:35:10.430 --> 05:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
to do all three of the divisions probate
 
05:35:12.110 --> 05:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
district and family
 
05:35:14.930 --> 05:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
as it happens we have more work in the
 
05:35:18.050 --> 05:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
Family Division than in District and so
 
05:35:20.690 --> 05:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
my week typically is two or three days
 
05:35:22.730 --> 05:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
of Family Division maybe one or two days
 
05:35:24.890 --> 05:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
of District division the occasional
 
05:35:28.128 --> 05:35:28.138 align:start position:0%
probate division assignment my family
 
05:35:28.138 --> 05:35:28.788 align:start position:0%
probate division assignment my family
um

05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:31.310 --> 05:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
days are typically either a full day
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
contested one hearing case that's been
 
05:35:37.368 --> 05:35:37.378 align:start position:0%
pending for a while or a list day which
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
is typically 30-minute hearings back to
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
back beginning at 8 30 and ending at
 
05:35:44.030 --> 05:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
four o'clock with the lunch hour if I
 
05:35:46.490 --> 05:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
can conjure that up somewhere
 
05:35:48.410 --> 05:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
let me just add to what judge king was
 
05:35:51.530 --> 05:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
saying in terms of our triaging on the
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
micro level
 
05:35:56.330 --> 05:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
we have a divorce and parenting cases
 
05:35:58.128 --> 05:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
which have an enormous spectrum of
 
05:36:00.530 --> 05:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
complexity some of those cases are
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
resolved virtually at the time that
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're filed and it's simply a question
 
05:36:07.128 --> 05:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
of reviewing the paperwork making sure
 
05:36:09.230 --> 05:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
the forms are in order and approving it
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
sending it out
 
05:36:13.250 --> 05:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
some of those are cases which begin in
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
difficult ways and go through a series
 
05:36:17.570 --> 05:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
of hearings that may be prompted by
 
05:36:19.970 --> 05:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
emergency motions or other features
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
unique to the case
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
May ultimately end up with full day or
 
05:36:27.650 --> 05:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes multi-day final hearings that
 
05:36:30.170 --> 05:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
involve multiple Witnesses
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
there may be a guardian ad litem
 
05:36:33.530 --> 05:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
involved there may be contested
 
05:36:35.330 --> 05:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
parenting issues contested Financial
 
05:36:38.090 --> 05:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
issues alimony support property
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
distribution all of that may be
 
05:36:43.368 --> 05:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
supported by exhibits which in my recent
 
05:36:45.650 --> 05:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
experience tend to be expanding rather
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
than Contracting
 
05:36:50.990 --> 05:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
and so those cases those complex divorce
 
05:36:52.430 --> 05:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
and parenting cases are a little bit
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
unpredictable we don't know which cases
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
are going to turn into that when they're
 
05:36:58.010 --> 05:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
first filed we don't have much control
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
over that
 
05:37:01.910 --> 05:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
our triage process though on the micro
 
05:37:04.610 --> 05:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
level on a daily basis is really
 
05:37:04.620 --> 05:37:06.050 align:start position:0%
level on a daily basis is really
threefold

05:37:06.050 --> 05:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
threefold
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have emergency motions that are filed
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
every day again unpredictably either in
 
05:37:14.448 --> 05:37:14.458 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting cases when there's an
 
05:37:16.970 --> 05:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
emergency that prompts one party to come
 
05:37:19.550 --> 05:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
to court and ask for immediate orders or
 
05:37:21.530 --> 05:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence petition sorts of
 
05:37:21.540 --> 05:37:22.670 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence petition sorts of
cases

05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:37:25.610 --> 05:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
in Laconia we get 350 more or less
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
domestic violence petitions every year
 
05:37:30.830 --> 05:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's unpredictable for us when those
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
cases are going to come in although we
 
05:37:34.910 --> 05:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
inexperienced know that Friday afternoon
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
and Monday mornings tend to be the times
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
but every day we're going to get
 
05:37:43.128 --> 05:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
emergency motions that are filed those
 
05:37:45.890 --> 05:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
motions are reviewed by a judge every
 
05:37:45.900 --> 05:37:46.970 align:start position:0%
motions are reviewed by a judge every
day

05:37:46.970 --> 05:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
not a single one of those cases comes in
 
05:37:52.250 --> 05:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
and lacks review by a judge and a
 
05:37:54.288 --> 05:37:54.298 align:start position:0%
decision by a judge whether to Grant an
 
05:37:56.448 --> 05:37:56.458 align:start position:0%
emergency protective order or emergency
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
relief and from time to time because our
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
protocols allow and require for a
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for the party who has been
 
05:38:07.448 --> 05:38:07.458 align:start position:0%
denied relief when they first come in
 
05:38:09.890 --> 05:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
occasionally those motions and those
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
filings result in the need for having a
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
hearing that day
 
05:38:16.310 --> 05:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's pretty rare but it happens
 
05:38:17.690 --> 05:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
regularly enough that it's worth
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
mentioning so that's the overlay to our
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
daily work otherwise our daily work is
 
05:38:25.550 --> 05:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
managing the cases that have to be
 
05:38:27.170 --> 05:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
scheduled according to the statutory
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines the judge king mentioned those
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
cases have to be scheduled they have to
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
be heard and the orders have to be
 
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
entered within the certain statutory
 
05:38:39.288 --> 05:38:39.298 align:start position:0%
deadlines and behind those come our
 
05:38:42.288 --> 05:38:42.298 align:start position:0%
cases without statutory deadlines and of
 
05:38:45.730 --> 05:38:45.740 align:start position:0%
varying levels of complexity so my day
 
05:38:48.830 --> 05:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be either one or the other
 
05:38:50.690 --> 05:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
typically in Family Division it's either
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
a list a or a full day or more than one
 
05:38:56.930 --> 05:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
full day of final hearings and in the
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
middle I'm going to get a Sprinkle of
 
05:39:01.010 --> 05:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
emergency motions that are filed as the
 
05:39:02.990 --> 05:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
day goes by and I have to carve out time
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
to make orders on those cases
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
so our triage is basically emergency
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
cases cases that have statutory
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
deadlines that may be creeping up on us
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
and the divorce and parenting cases that
 
05:39:17.570 --> 05:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't have statutory deadlines and
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's simply how we manage it day to
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
day in the Family Division and to a
 
05:39:25.690 --> 05:39:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.288 --> 05:39:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
even even if our judicial head count
 
05:39:35.570 --> 05:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
where where it needed to be in terms of
 
05:39:37.190 --> 05:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
the way to caseload
 
05:39:40.190 --> 05:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
we would not be adequately serving the
 
05:39:41.750 --> 05:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire the people of
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if we did not augment our
 
05:39:45.530 --> 05:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
court staff
 
05:39:48.530 --> 05:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd like to have judge king talk
 
05:39:48.540 --> 05:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd like to have judge king talk
about

05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:39:52.490 --> 05:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
the pressures that we are facing like
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
every other employer in our state with
 
05:39:58.128 --> 05:39:58.138 align:start position:0%
respect to current vacancies and the
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
effects that that has on our ability to
 
05:40:01.440 --> 05:40:02.510 align:start position:0%
effects that that has on our ability to
to

05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:40:02.520 --> 05:40:04.128 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:40:04.128 --> 05:40:04.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:06.590 --> 05:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
for for the judges to do their jobs and
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
for the people to um
 
05:40:11.810 --> 05:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
receive receive the services that that
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:18.070 --> 05:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
so needless to say during the pandemic
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
we averaged about 70 to 75 percent of
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
our staff showing up on any given day
 
05:40:28.550 --> 05:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
that was a tremendous pressure now that
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're sort of on the back side of that
 
05:40:32.448 --> 05:40:32.458 align:start position:0%
our biggest challenge is that we're just
 
05:40:34.850 --> 05:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
not competitive the judicial branch is
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
not competitive with starting wages our
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
starting wage for a quarter system 2
 
05:40:41.510 --> 05:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
which is an entry level position is
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
around 15 an hour after union dues I
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's 14 and change we
 
05:40:52.368 --> 05:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
currently as of this morning have 39
 
05:40:55.310 --> 05:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
full-time vacant staff positions most of
 
05:40:57.230 --> 05:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
which have been posted for an extended
 
05:40:59.810 --> 05:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
period of time three just in the Concord
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
circuit court court assistant threes
 
05:41:03.470 --> 05:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
which are not entry levels those are the
 
05:41:05.570 --> 05:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
next step up that we we just haven't
 
05:41:07.490 --> 05:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
even had any applications for people
 
05:41:08.990 --> 05:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
aren't applying to Workforce at those
 
05:41:10.850 --> 05:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
wages so today we have 37 full-time
 
05:41:13.128 --> 05:41:13.138 align:start position:0%
vacant positions and three part-time
 
05:41:16.430 --> 05:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
vacant positions out of 359 total
 
05:41:18.890 --> 05:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
positions so even at the positions that
 
05:41:21.288 --> 05:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
are authorized notwithstanding that the
 
05:41:23.628 --> 05:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study reflects that we
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
need another 30 30 plus we have more
 
05:41:28.970 --> 05:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
than 10 percent of our seats that are
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
vacant and absent some relief in the
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget for our wage restructuring
 
05:41:37.670 --> 05:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to be vacant
 
05:41:39.530 --> 05:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have staff to process
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
the orders and get them out it's one
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
thing for a judge to hold a hearing sign
 
05:41:45.410 --> 05:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
the order you may see another two to
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
three weeks before that order gets out
 
05:41:49.250 --> 05:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
the door because we don't have staff to
 
05:41:50.570 --> 05:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
process and I'm sure you've heard from
 
05:41:52.730 --> 05:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
from constituents that that's the case
 
05:41:55.550 --> 05:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
and that's our reality and our staff
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
work really really hard
 
05:41:58.798 --> 05:41:59.390 align:start position:0%
work really really hard
um

05:41:59.390 --> 05:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:01.850 --> 05:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
and we offer great benefits but we're
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
finding that the the Millennials don't
 
05:42:05.090 --> 05:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
care about health insurance because
 
05:42:06.288 --> 05:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
they're probably on their parents health
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
insurance or they're not going to get
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
sick anyway so they don't need health
 
05:42:11.810 --> 05:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
insurance they just want to know what am
 
05:42:13.250 --> 05:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
I going to be paid an hour and we have
 
05:42:16.250 --> 05:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
literally lost folks who have gone to
 
05:42:18.650 --> 05:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts and fast food restaurants
 
05:42:20.330 --> 05:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
because they pay more an hour that's
 
05:42:24.410 --> 05:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
so finally page slide 34 is a summary of
 
05:42:33.850 --> 05:42:33.860 align:start position:0%
part of our budget request that is in
 
05:42:36.230 --> 05:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
reflects what we learn from our
 
05:42:40.490 --> 05:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
evidence-based way to caseload
 
05:42:43.788 --> 05:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
as to judges you will see that of the 17
 
05:42:45.770 --> 05:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
you'll recall
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
judges that the study identified we've
 
05:42:51.770 --> 05:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
requested seven in in the superior court
 
05:42:54.770 --> 05:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
of the three and a half uh judges that
 
05:42:57.170 --> 05:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
were identified as needed we've
 
05:43:00.890 --> 05:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
requested one in terms of Court staff 31
 
05:43:02.930 --> 05:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
new clerical staff in the Circuit Court
 
05:43:06.470 --> 05:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
in one new clerk in the circuit court
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
and in the Superior Court 4 News
 
05:43:14.330 --> 05:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:16.310 --> 05:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that is a summary of the way the
 
05:43:19.368 --> 05:43:19.378 align:start position:0%
caseload study I'm now going to ask uh
 
05:43:22.128 --> 05:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
judge king to give a breakdown of some
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
statistics relating to the Family
 
05:43:24.000 --> 05:43:26.510 align:start position:0%
statistics relating to the Family
Division

05:43:26.510 --> 05:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
Division
 
05:43:28.128 --> 05:43:28.138 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure what the Committees
 
05:43:30.410 --> 05:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
want to hear so I'm happy to not do
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
anything I put together a few statistics
 
05:43:33.770 --> 05:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
that I thought you might find
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
interesting I've already mentioned the
 
05:43:39.470 --> 05:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
the volume of cases that and those are
 
05:43:40.930 --> 05:43:40.940 align:start position:0%
in the slides
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
I want to make the point that
 
05:43:47.570 --> 05:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
I've already talked about the turnover
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
in judges but 25 of our full-time judges
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
have been appointed since 2018 so more
 
05:43:56.448 --> 05:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
than half our bench has been on the
 
05:43:58.190 --> 05:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
bench less than five years so these are
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
Judges that are still in the process of
 
05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
learning to be judges some of them have
 
05:44:03.170 --> 05:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
come to us as prosecutors some have come
 
05:44:06.170 --> 05:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
from various law practices and they have
 
05:44:09.470 --> 05:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
to be trained as judge Garner said to
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
learn the breadth of the jurisdiction in
 
05:44:13.250 --> 05:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
the circuit court so that they're
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
fungible and we can move them from
 
05:44:17.330 --> 05:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
the judges are often in the courtrooms
 
05:44:22.490 --> 05:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
kind of on their own in the circuit
 
05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
court if you go to a superior court
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see a court monitor which is the
 
05:44:29.208 --> 05:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
person who's with the judge responsible
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
to make sure the record's running
 
05:44:33.170 --> 05:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
properly and has headphones on to make
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
sure everything's functional
 
05:44:37.670 --> 05:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
our judges are often responsible for
 
05:44:39.288 --> 05:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
turning the recorders on and off which
 
05:44:40.670 --> 05:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
are not located on the bench they're
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or the court security
 
05:44:44.448 --> 05:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
offices turn them on or off we we don't
 
05:44:46.368 --> 05:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
have court monitors and our judges don't
 
05:44:48.830 --> 05:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
have law Clerks so in the Superior Court
 
05:44:50.810 --> 05:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court there are a lot of
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
Clerks who are lawyers who assist with
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
writing orders doing research our judges
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
are on their own to do that we have
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
three staff attorneys to service roughly
 
05:45:03.948 --> 05:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
60 judicial officers in the circuit
 
05:45:05.690 --> 05:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
court and so you can expect that they
 
05:45:08.330 --> 05:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of time to be sitting
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
in on hearings and helping to write
 
05:45:13.250 --> 05:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
orders when the pandemic started and we
 
05:45:17.288 --> 05:45:17.298 align:start position:0%
moved to more remote hearings our
 
05:45:20.030 --> 05:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
costs for telephone was going through
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
the roof and so we immediately began to
 
05:45:24.048 --> 05:45:24.058 align:start position:0%
track the number of hearings and the
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
number of remote hearings and I thought
 
05:45:28.010 --> 05:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
you might find this statistic
 
05:45:31.610 --> 05:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
interesting since mid-march of 2020 in
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court as of the end of
 
05:45:35.448 --> 05:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
February Circuit Court judges have
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
conducted 469 532 hearings
 
05:45:42.708 --> 05:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
of those two hundred and two thousand
 
05:45:44.090 --> 05:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
four hundred and twenty three had at
 
05:45:46.850 --> 05:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
least one party who participated
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
remotely either by telephone or by video
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
so about 43 percent but almost 470 000
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
hearings since March of 2020.
 
05:45:58.368 --> 05:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
most of the folks who come to the
 
05:46:00.288 --> 05:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court don't have attorneys we
 
05:46:01.788 --> 05:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
call them self-represented litigants
 
05:46:05.090 --> 05:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent of parenting divorce
 
05:46:06.890 --> 05:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
cases have at least one unrepresented
 
05:46:06.900 --> 05:46:07.670 align:start position:0%
cases have at least one unrepresented
party

05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
that has its own challenges
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
and of all of the appeals that the
 
05:46:15.948 --> 05:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court gets about 30 percent of
 
05:46:17.330 --> 05:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
the total number come out of the Family
 
05:46:17.340 --> 05:46:18.708 align:start position:0%
the total number come out of the Family
Division

05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
Division
 
05:46:21.530 --> 05:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
so it's a small number in terms of the
 
05:46:23.208 --> 05:46:23.218 align:start position:0%
gross number of cases but a lot of those
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
cases get appealed and 40 or so of those
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
are termination of parental rights cases
 
05:46:32.690 --> 05:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
judge Garner talked about some cases
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
move quickly some take longer in 2014 we
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
had some law students for the summer and
 
05:46:41.448 --> 05:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
we wanted to try to see if we could come
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
up with data points that were common
 
05:46:46.010 --> 05:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
across divorce parenting cases that
 
05:46:49.128 --> 05:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
caused them to be open longer than a
 
05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
year so we looked at all of the cases
 
05:46:55.490 --> 05:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
that were disposed between January and
 
05:46:59.690 --> 05:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
December of 2014 which was 7 500 cases
 
05:46:59.700 --> 05:47:01.090 align:start position:0%
December of 2014 which was 7 500 cases
roughly

05:47:01.090 --> 05:47:01.100 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
05:47:05.030 --> 05:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
of those cases 50 percent closed within
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
three months so from the time the case
 
05:47:08.650 --> 05:47:08.660 align:start position:0%
was open the time it closed three months
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
seventy percent were closed within six
 
05:47:14.270 --> 05:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
months 80 percent within nine months and
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
87 percent were closed within a year and
 
05:47:19.128 --> 05:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
that's sort of our goal with a new
 
05:47:20.810 --> 05:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
divorce cases from
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
open to disposition is a year we hope
 
05:47:25.548 --> 05:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
that more than 90 percent close within
 
05:47:26.990 --> 05:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
that time frame
 
05:47:27.000 --> 05:47:28.070 align:start position:0%
that time frame
um

05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:30.650 --> 05:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
most cases get resolved fairly quickly
 
05:47:32.090 --> 05:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
in the Family Division
 
05:47:34.368 --> 05:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
there are some that don't and that go on
 
05:47:36.048 --> 05:47:36.058 align:start position:0%
for years there are some cases that have
 
05:47:38.448 --> 05:47:38.458 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of pleadings those
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
are the cases that I think you've been
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
hearing about in some of those in your
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
committees and that's just the reality
 
05:47:45.470 --> 05:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
of the circuit court it's not one size
 
05:47:46.970 --> 05:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit all
 
05:47:46.980 --> 05:47:49.128 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit all
um

05:47:49.128 --> 05:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.510 --> 05:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
so I think those are the numbers I
 
05:47:53.628 --> 05:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.090 --> 05:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman to anticipate another area
 
05:47:59.628 --> 05:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
of Interest based on our conversation I
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
know Rules of Evidence and evidentiary
 
05:48:04.730 --> 05:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
issues in Family Division has been a
 
05:48:07.850 --> 05:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
concern to to the Committees so I would
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
like to ask judge Garner to discuss that
 
05:48:11.330 --> 05:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
05:48:13.610 --> 05:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate yes thank you judge thank
 
05:48:13.620 --> 05:48:21.350 align:start position:0%
appropriate yes thank you judge thank
you

05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:23.628 --> 05:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
we think in terms of admissibility of
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and really that just means
 
05:48:28.970 --> 05:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
what is the court allowed to consider
 
05:48:31.070 --> 05:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
what is the court not going to consider
 
05:48:33.470 --> 05:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of being a gatekeeper for what
 
05:48:36.470 --> 05:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
we hope is going to be reliable evidence
 
05:48:36.480 --> 05:48:38.330 align:start position:0%
we hope is going to be reliable evidence
the

05:48:38.330 --> 05:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:40.310 --> 05:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
question of the Rules of Evidence in
 
05:48:43.850 --> 05:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
Family Division is as I understand the
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
subject of some proposed legislation so
 
05:48:48.890 --> 05:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
let me try to give you a background and
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you'll indulge me I'll give you some
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
perspective in terms of what the reasons
 
05:48:56.030 --> 05:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
might be
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
that might cause you to think carefully
 
05:49:01.368 --> 05:49:01.378 align:start position:0%
about that sort of a proposal
 
05:49:04.250 --> 05:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
currently the rules of evidence and I
 
05:49:07.128 --> 05:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
brought my book with me it's a desk copy
 
05:49:09.170 --> 05:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
that they give us we all have it
 
05:49:12.530 --> 05:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
as lawyers we were trained in it from
 
05:49:16.128 --> 05:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
law school and it is for those of us who
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of District division cases
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
criminal cases particularly everyone in
 
05:49:22.128 --> 05:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
05:49:24.048 --> 05:49:24.058 align:start position:0%
they live by the rules of evidence it's
 
05:49:25.610 --> 05:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
a daily thing for them
 
05:49:27.708 --> 05:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
in Family Division
 
05:49:29.868 --> 05:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
it's not so much that way and
 
05:49:31.850 --> 05:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
particularly in domestic relations cases
 
05:49:34.128 --> 05:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
which are divorce parenting support
 
05:49:35.930 --> 05:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
cases paternity
 
05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I can lump domestic violence cases
 
05:49:41.090 --> 05:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
in with that the Rules of Evidence don't
 
05:49:41.100 --> 05:49:42.350 align:start position:0%
in with that the Rules of Evidence don't
apply

05:49:42.350 --> 05:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
apply
 
05:49:44.570 --> 05:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
and the Authority for that is a series
 
05:49:46.788 --> 05:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
of Supreme Court decisions that actually
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
go back at least 80 years
 
05:49:51.288 --> 05:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
and so there's a culture that these
 
05:49:54.048 --> 05:49:54.058 align:start position:0%
sorts of cases do not receive the strict
 
05:49:55.610 --> 05:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
treatment of the Rules of Evidence in
 
05:49:57.470 --> 05:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the judge's decision whether to
 
05:49:59.330 --> 05:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
admit certain evidence
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
or certain other kinds of evidence we
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
have discretion
 
05:50:05.470 --> 05:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
the Family Division rules
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
carry on that that feature of our
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
practice that the Rules of Evidence
 
05:50:12.350 --> 05:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't strictly apply but the Family
 
05:50:15.770 --> 05:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
Division rules it's a rule 2.2 also
 
05:50:18.770 --> 05:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
provide that the trial judge in their
 
05:50:21.410 --> 05:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
discretion can utilize The Rules of
 
05:50:24.110 --> 05:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
Evidence in order to create an orderly
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
predictable and fair kind of a
 
05:50:30.288 --> 05:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
proceeding so that's available to us
 
05:50:32.330 --> 05:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
in addition The Rules of Evidence
 
05:50:34.850 --> 05:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
themselves carry a long list of
 
05:50:38.570 --> 05:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
exemptions under a rule 1101 and among
 
05:50:40.128 --> 05:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
those exemptions from The Rules of
 
05:50:43.910 --> 05:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
Evidence are Domestic Relations cases so
 
05:50:46.010 --> 05:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's the current law The Rules of
 
05:50:48.830 --> 05:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply the court in in
 
05:50:52.070 --> 05:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
some cases can use them but I would
 
05:50:54.048 --> 05:50:54.058 align:start position:0%
suggest only consistent with an
 
05:50:56.448 --> 05:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
agreement if there are attorneys
 
05:50:58.250 --> 05:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
typically representing both sides
 
05:51:00.470 --> 05:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
because the Rules of Evidence are
 
05:51:00.480 --> 05:51:01.730 align:start position:0%
because the Rules of Evidence are
complicated

05:51:01.730 --> 05:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:51:04.250 --> 05:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
and their application is often highly
 
05:51:04.260 --> 05:51:05.208 align:start position:0%
and their application is often highly
technical

05:51:05.208 --> 05:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
technical
 
05:51:09.230 --> 05:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
and the results are not always intuitive
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
this makes them a challenge for folks
 
05:51:13.368 --> 05:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
who are representing themselves and it
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
makes it a challenge for folks who are
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
represented by an attorney with a
 
05:51:19.128 --> 05:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant on the other
 
05:51:19.138 --> 05:51:20.448 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant on the other
side

05:51:20.448 --> 05:51:20.458 align:start position:0%
side
 
05:51:20.458 --> 05:51:22.610 align:start position:0%
side
so

05:51:22.610 --> 05:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:26.330 --> 05:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
the cases that tell us that the Rules of
 
05:51:28.850 --> 05:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply in these kinds of
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
cases don't embellish much about the
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
reasons why that should be
 
05:51:35.868 --> 05:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
but I'll share with you my perspective
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
based on my experience about what those
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
reasons might be
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
first are the rules of evidence are
 
05:51:45.410 --> 05:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
really a tool for trial lawyers
 
05:51:49.910 --> 05:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're a tool to create a reliable
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
gatekeeping process so that the fact
 
05:51:55.310 --> 05:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
finder typically a jury in those cases
 
05:51:58.128 --> 05:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
have reliable evidence to consider and
 
05:52:00.230 --> 05:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't have unreliable evidence
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
trial lawyers live by the rules of
 
05:52:05.868 --> 05:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
evidence judges in jury courts and
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
judges in criminal cases including
 
05:52:09.230 --> 05:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
judges in the district division in
 
05:52:11.208 --> 05:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court apply the Rules of
 
05:52:13.490 --> 05:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
Evidence have to be careful about them
 
05:52:18.530 --> 05:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
and take that obligation very seriously
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
there are no juries in circuit court and
 
05:52:21.890 --> 05:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
there are no juries in the Family
 
05:52:23.930 --> 05:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
Division in circuit court and so at
 
05:52:25.368 --> 05:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
least that part of it isn't really
 
05:52:25.378 --> 05:52:26.810 align:start position:0%
least that part of it isn't really
necessary

05:52:26.810 --> 05:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:52:29.448 --> 05:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
Family Division cases and I'm thinking
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
mostly now Domestic Relations divorce
 
05:52:34.490 --> 05:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
and parenting cases also have a couple
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
of unique features that I think
 
05:52:39.170 --> 05:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
undermine the reason that might support
 
05:52:41.208 --> 05:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
applying the rules of evidence in a
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
strict way the first of these is that
 
05:52:45.650 --> 05:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
our court
 
05:52:48.530 --> 05:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
tries its best to make our process user
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
friendly for those who are coming to
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
court for orders
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
and tries its best to make the process
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
as non-adversarial as possible partly
 
05:53:01.850 --> 05:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
because often these folks who are in
 
05:53:04.010 --> 05:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
front of the court on day one are going
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
to have parenting responsibilities for
 
05:53:09.410 --> 05:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
children after the case is over and we
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that as difficult as
 
05:53:13.730 --> 05:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
that case is for them we don't make it
 
05:53:16.190 --> 05:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
more difficult by imposing on them
 
05:53:19.368 --> 05:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
certain procedural strictures that they
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
may be unable to meet and that may
 
05:53:24.470 --> 05:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
generate a result that at least they
 
05:53:26.570 --> 05:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
will feel at some level wasn't a fair
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
result because of the application of
 
05:53:29.868 --> 05:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
05:53:29.878 --> 05:53:31.490 align:start position:0%
these rules
finally

05:53:31.490 --> 05:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
finally
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting cases often take
 
05:53:34.680 --> 05:53:35.930 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting cases often take
um

05:53:35.930 --> 05:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
often obligate the court to take into
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
account what's going to happen in the
 
05:53:40.680 --> 05:53:41.570 align:start position:0%
account what's going to happen in the
future

05:53:41.570 --> 05:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
if we're going to create a property
 
05:53:46.430 --> 05:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
distribution or alimony or certainly
 
05:53:48.410 --> 05:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
parenting orders that are going to be in
 
05:53:50.448 --> 05:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
place from the time of the final decree
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
on we have to take a Long View in terms
 
05:53:55.730 --> 05:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
of what's going to happen what are the
 
05:53:58.368 --> 05:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
likelihoods what are the parents parties
 
05:54:01.250 --> 05:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
expectations and planning for that sort
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
of a thing really doesn't have much to
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
do with what actually happened the Rules
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
of Evidence are designed to provide
 
05:54:10.490 --> 05:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
reliable evidence about what actually
 
05:54:13.010 --> 05:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
happened and that certainly is part of
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
what we have to do but it's not the
 
05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
whole picture in these kinds of cases we
 
05:54:19.128 --> 05:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
have to take into account some planning
 
05:54:21.410 --> 05:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
element for the future for these parties
 
05:54:23.690 --> 05:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
lives that are being deconstructed and
 
05:54:25.970 --> 05:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
rearranged by this process
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
and the Rules of Evidence aren't
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily helpful for that we want to
 
05:54:33.048 --> 05:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
give the parties the opportunity to tell
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
us what their concerns are to develop a
 
05:54:37.610 --> 05:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
plan for the future and to provide
 
05:54:39.350 --> 05:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
evidence that would support that plan
 
05:54:41.690 --> 05:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
not necessarily evidence that would be
 
05:54:44.090 --> 05:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
reliable to a fact finder but evidence
 
05:54:45.948 --> 05:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
would be reliable for someone who's
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
planning the future of this family in
 
05:54:50.810 --> 05:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
one way or another judge got him excuse
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
me for a minute being passed around to
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
some cards for members of the two
 
05:54:57.048 --> 05:54:57.058 align:start position:0%
committees if they have questions as
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
well for them to write them down and
 
05:55:00.970 --> 05:55:00.980 align:start position:0%
then when you have please send them back
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
and chairman Lynn is sorting them by
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
question type sorry sir carry on
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you and I might add too
 
05:55:11.628 --> 05:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:55:14.330 --> 05:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
Richard has my email so if you think of
 
05:55:15.708 --> 05:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
something after the hearing that you
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
think I can weigh in on in terms of our
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
practice or our challenges or a court
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
process please let him know he'll send
 
05:55:23.930 --> 05:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
it on to me I'll be more than happy to
 
05:55:23.940 --> 05:55:25.970 align:start position:0%
it on to me I'll be more than happy to
respond

05:55:25.970 --> 05:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
respond
 
05:55:25.980 --> 05:55:33.110 align:start position:0%
respond
then

05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:35.090 --> 05:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
there are some practical reasons I think
 
05:55:37.250 --> 05:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
that the imposition of the Rules of
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
Evidence might be of some concern to
 
05:55:40.490 --> 05:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
those of us who hear these sorts of
 
05:55:42.590 --> 05:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
cases in Family Division
 
05:55:45.048 --> 05:55:45.058 align:start position:0%
particularly if you have a situation
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
where one party is represented by
 
05:55:48.770 --> 05:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
Council and the other party is not
 
05:55:51.288 --> 05:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
represented by Council the side that's
 
05:55:53.090 --> 05:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
represented is going to start out with
 
05:55:55.010 --> 05:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
some Advantage there if the Rules of
 
05:55:57.170 --> 05:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
Evidence are being applied an attorney
 
05:55:59.810 --> 05:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
May well have an obligation to their
 
05:56:01.490 --> 05:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
client to try to take advantage of the
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence to the extent possible
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's part of our adversarial system
 
05:56:07.310 --> 05:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing wrong with that
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
unless one party is so disadvantaged by
 
05:56:13.250 --> 05:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
their lack of knowledge about the rules
 
05:56:14.990 --> 05:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
or their lack of experience about the
 
05:56:18.170 --> 05:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
rules that they simply are a target for
 
05:56:20.090 --> 05:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
the imposition of the rules in a strict
 
05:56:23.628 --> 05:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
way and requiring the rules to apply
 
05:56:26.330 --> 05:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for the court to
 
05:56:28.670 --> 05:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
generate some kinds of information in
 
05:56:30.170 --> 05:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
that context
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
further in the situation where both
 
05:56:35.448 --> 05:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
parties are self-represented and that's
 
05:56:36.830 --> 05:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:56:39.470 --> 05:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
rough guess more than 50 percent of our
 
05:56:42.048 --> 05:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
cases divorce and parenting cases
 
05:56:44.270 --> 05:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
involve folks who are representing
 
05:56:46.190 --> 05:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
themselves each of them
 
05:56:48.890 --> 05:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
applying the Rules of Evidence to those
 
05:56:51.230 --> 05:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of cases creates what I think is
 
05:56:53.390 --> 05:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
likely an insurmountable challenge for
 
05:56:55.970 --> 05:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
them and it also begs the question of
 
05:56:58.010 --> 05:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
who's going to
 
05:57:00.470 --> 05:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
be the gatekeeper there in a very
 
05:57:01.750 --> 05:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
practical way
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
if one party is testifying in a way or
 
05:57:06.170 --> 05:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
submitting evidence
 
05:57:09.048 --> 05:57:09.058 align:start position:0%
that is clearly contrary to The Rules of
 
05:57:09.058 --> 05:57:10.250 align:start position:0%
that is clearly contrary to The Rules of
Evidence

05:57:10.250 --> 05:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
the judge is faced with a choice if the
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
other party is not objecting does the
 
05:57:16.610 --> 05:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
court weigh in and say you can't do that
 
05:57:20.030 --> 05:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
that feels to the party reasonably feels
 
05:57:21.410 --> 05:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the party as though the Court's
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
simply not in interested in listening to
 
05:57:25.788 --> 05:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
what they have to say or in considering
 
05:57:27.230 --> 05:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
their evidence
 
05:57:29.090 --> 05:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
so there are sort of a myriad of
 
05:57:30.890 --> 05:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
practical problems that go along with
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
that as someone who is trained in the
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
rules and who
 
05:57:38.330 --> 05:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
worked with the rules as an attorney
 
05:57:41.090 --> 05:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
doing trials and as someone who still
 
05:57:42.910 --> 05:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
applies the rules in District division
 
05:57:45.708 --> 05:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases
 
05:57:47.690 --> 05:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
I have tremendous respect for the rules
 
05:57:49.310 --> 05:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
of evidence and I think there's a role
 
05:57:52.970 --> 05:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
for them I'm concerned that the strict
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
imposition of the Rules of Evidence May
 
05:57:57.890 --> 05:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
extend our cases these sorts of cases in
 
05:58:00.170 --> 05:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
Family Division may not really be a good
 
05:58:02.270 --> 05:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
fit for these sorts of cases in Family
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
Division and will create impediments and
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
costs to the parties both in terms of
 
05:58:09.530 --> 05:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
the time and in terms of some
 
05:58:12.048 --> 05:58:12.058 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction with the result if it if
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
it appears to them that the result is
 
05:58:16.970 --> 05:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
based on a technical application
 
05:58:19.788 --> 05:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be happy about the
 
05:58:22.490 --> 05:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
results if it appears and I think
 
05:58:24.410 --> 05:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
studies that we've learned about have
 
05:58:26.810 --> 05:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
shown this if the parties feel as though
 
05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
the process is fair they've been
 
05:58:31.850 --> 05:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
listened to they've been understood the
 
05:58:33.470 --> 05:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
court is taken into account their
 
05:58:35.628 --> 05:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
concerns and their own point of view
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
then the outcome is slightly less
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
critical to them it's the process itself
 
05:58:42.530 --> 05:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to make as Fair as
 
05:58:44.150 --> 05:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
possible to these folks who are often
 
05:58:47.330 --> 05:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
representing themselves and the in my
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
view the marginal benefit of imposing
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence is probably
 
05:58:53.590 --> 05:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
outweighed in the long term
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
by the the difficulties that it creates
 
05:59:00.110 --> 05:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
for folks within that system and the
 
05:59:02.208 --> 05:59:02.218 align:start position:0%
difficulties it creates in achieving the
 
05:59:04.910 --> 05:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
goals that we'd like to try to meet
 
05:59:06.890 --> 05:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
so that's my practical take I want to
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
clarify that I'm not speaking on behalf
 
05:59:11.090 --> 05:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch this is this is
 
05:59:13.850 --> 05:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
my read based on my experience judge
 
05:59:15.470 --> 05:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
Gunner um
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn has been sorting the cards
 
05:59:20.270 --> 05:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
by type and I've asked him if he has
 
05:59:23.090 --> 05:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
cards on this particular issue of Rules
 
05:59:25.850 --> 05:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
of Evidence this would be a good time to
 
05:59:28.368 --> 05:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
take questions on that subject you just
 
05:59:30.288 --> 05:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
spoke of thank you
 
05:59:32.208 --> 05:59:32.218 align:start position:0%
I might mention while he's sorting
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
through those cards that if you have
 
05:59:37.010 --> 05:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
questions about the Rules of Evidence
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
um generally and even specifically
 
05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.058 align:start position:0%
I don't consider myself an expert in the
 
05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence by any means but you
 
05:59:46.490 --> 05:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
have an expert sitting here in this room
 
05:59:50.030 --> 05:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I suspect that representative Lynn
 
05:59:51.770 --> 05:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to sort of give
 
05:59:53.810 --> 05:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
you the Practical impact of the Rules of
 
05:59:58.850 --> 05:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you I wonder how quickly I
 
06:00:07.510 --> 06:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be reversed though but yeah
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you know I um I guess I would um
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
in trying to follow up on what you were
 
06:00:18.170 --> 06:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
just speaking of um judge Garner
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
um one one questioner says if the rules
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
of evidence do not do not apply then
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
does the court rely on hearsay
 
06:00:27.650 --> 06:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
in its orders
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and I wonder if you could maybe just
 
06:00:31.070 --> 06:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that a bit it's a
 
06:00:33.350 --> 06:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
complicated answer and and I don't like
 
06:00:35.330 --> 06:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
to say maybe but
 
06:00:37.610 --> 06:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
if the Rules of Evidence don't apply the
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
court has discretion to determine what's
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
relevant and to determine what's
 
06:00:44.570 --> 06:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
material and helpful to the court in
 
06:00:46.490 --> 06:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
making its decision
 
06:00:48.830 --> 06:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
there are on and I should mention just
 
06:00:51.470 --> 06:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
by way of background that
 
06:00:54.170 --> 06:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
hearsay is a vast part of the Rules of
 
06:00:56.570 --> 06:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
Evidence so even applying the Rules of
 
06:00:58.368 --> 06:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
Evidence there are some statements that
 
06:00:59.990 --> 06:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
are not hearsay because of the reason
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
that they're offered and there are a
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
long list of exceptions to the rule
 
06:01:06.650 --> 06:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
against hearsay which cover many of the
 
06:01:08.930 --> 06:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
kinds of evidence that people would
 
06:01:10.970 --> 06:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
submit that would be admissible even
 
06:01:12.770 --> 06:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
Under The Rules of Evidence
 
06:01:15.288 --> 06:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you when my personal take is
 
06:01:18.170 --> 06:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
when I have a hearsay objection I'm
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to be guided by the rules to begin
 
06:01:21.708 --> 06:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
with if it's not hearsay then I'm going
 
06:01:24.170 --> 06:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
to overrule the objection if it is
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
hearsay I'll run through in my head what
 
06:01:27.890 --> 06:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
the exceptions might be
 
06:01:29.810 --> 06:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
and if there are no exceptions that
 
06:01:32.448 --> 06:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
particularly cover it I'll ask myself
 
06:01:34.610 --> 06:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
what are the independent indicio
 
06:01:37.250 --> 06:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
reliability about this particular piece
 
06:01:39.410 --> 06:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
of evidence whether it's a statement or
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's a document is there
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
something about it either the context or
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
the content or plugging it into that
 
06:01:48.288 --> 06:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
piece of the case it makes it reliable
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
in a way that we wouldn't ordinarily
 
06:01:53.690 --> 06:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
rely on on a blank statement
 
06:01:56.448 --> 06:01:56.458 align:start position:0%
and if it is then I'll probably let it
 
06:02:00.530 --> 06:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
in so the answer is that hearsay some
 
06:02:03.170 --> 06:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
kinds of hearsay is admissible is
 
06:02:05.090 --> 06:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
admissible under the rules under one of
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the exceptions and I don't expect that
 
06:02:09.288 --> 06:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
the Family Division in these sorts of
 
06:02:09.298 --> 06:02:12.230 align:start position:0%
the Family Division in these sorts of
cases

06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:14.690 --> 06:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
would allow um
 
06:02:16.670 --> 06:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
would disallow evidence that would come
 
06:02:18.350 --> 06:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
in under the rules I think if anything
 
06:02:19.850 --> 06:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to expand a little bit
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
beyond the rules to get information that
 
06:02:24.530 --> 06:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
we're greedy for frankly in in looking
 
06:02:27.288 --> 06:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
to make good decisions and to help these
 
06:02:29.208 --> 06:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
folks for the rest of their lives so
 
06:02:32.690 --> 06:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
that's my maybe answer okay thank you
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
um and let me just address this to
 
06:02:38.208 --> 06:02:38.218 align:start position:0%
really all any of you who may want to
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
answer it the question is without Rules
 
06:02:43.368 --> 06:02:43.378 align:start position:0%
of Evidence how do you address possible
 
06:02:45.288 --> 06:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
mental health concerns
 
06:02:47.570 --> 06:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
as related to the best interest of the
 
06:02:47.580 --> 06:02:48.590 align:start position:0%
as related to the best interest of the
child

06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
06:02:52.128 --> 06:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh in making custody and or parenting
 
06:02:54.770 --> 06:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
time decisions
 
06:02:54.780 --> 06:02:55.730 align:start position:0%
time decisions
sure

06:02:55.730 --> 06:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:02:58.128 --> 06:02:58.138 align:start position:0%
I think actually there's some potential
 
06:02:59.690 --> 06:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
for the Rules of Evidence to be an
 
06:03:02.208 --> 06:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
impediment to that sort of an inquiry
 
06:03:06.770 --> 06:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:09.350 --> 06:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
therapy or counseling records those
 
06:03:11.448 --> 06:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
 
06:03:14.090 --> 06:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
are often the best evidence that might
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
bear on that kind of a question
 
06:03:18.048 --> 06:03:18.058 align:start position:0%
and the Rules of Evidence might
 
06:03:20.090 --> 06:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes exclude those because of the
 
06:03:21.770 --> 06:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
lack of a foundation or a lack of
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
authentication whereas if the parties
 
06:03:26.810 --> 06:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
agree that a document is something that
 
06:03:29.448 --> 06:03:29.458 align:start position:0%
it is what it purports to be and it's
 
06:03:32.330 --> 06:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
relevant then the court would typically
 
06:03:34.010 --> 06:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
take that into account and probably
 
06:03:35.448 --> 06:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
allow it to be marked and probably
 
06:03:37.610 --> 06:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
consider it I should mention as a
 
06:03:39.470 --> 06:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
footnote because we're talking about
 
06:03:42.890 --> 06:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
medical or counseling records that the
 
06:03:44.930 --> 06:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
provisions of the rules of evidence that
 
06:03:46.670 --> 06:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
relate to privileges
 
06:03:48.830 --> 06:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
attorney-client privilege doctor patient
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
privileged counselor therapist privilege
 
06:03:53.690 --> 06:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
those carry on and those are applied
 
06:03:55.850 --> 06:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
even in the cases where the Rules of
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't strictly apply so there
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
may be issues related to privilege that
 
06:04:02.270 --> 06:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
might keep something out of that nature
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
but the authentication issues were
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
likely to get past if the parties agree
 
06:04:10.430 --> 06:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:11.628 --> 06:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
um this is a little a little bit
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
different but I think it generally goes
 
06:04:16.128 --> 06:04:16.138 align:start position:0%
to the sort of the issues of efficiency
 
06:04:18.410 --> 06:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch and the and I'm
 
06:04:20.930 --> 06:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of recasting the question but
 
06:04:25.490 --> 06:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh this questioner raises concerns about
 
06:04:25.500 --> 06:04:26.170 align:start position:0%
uh this questioner raises concerns about
um

06:04:26.170 --> 06:04:26.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:30.048 --> 06:04:30.058 align:start position:0%
delays in family cases and
 
06:04:30.058 --> 06:04:30.890 align:start position:0%
delays in family cases and
um

06:04:30.890 --> 06:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh particularly focuses on the fact that
 
06:04:35.990 --> 06:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
apparently that that in many cases the
 
06:04:37.970 --> 06:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
the presiding judge
 
06:04:37.980 --> 06:04:40.368 align:start position:0%
the presiding judge
changes

06:04:40.368 --> 06:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
changes
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
um during the course of the proceeding
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
here it is the ledge two or three times
 
06:04:45.770 --> 06:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
during the course of a proceeding could
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
you just kind of any of you really just
 
06:04:51.170 --> 06:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
sort of explain what when in a
 
06:04:53.448 --> 06:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
particular case is it normally assigned
 
06:04:55.788 --> 06:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
to a particular judge throughout the
 
06:04:59.330 --> 06:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
case or is it or does the judge do the
 
06:05:01.788 --> 06:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
judges change hearing to hearing and if
 
06:05:03.650 --> 06:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
so when when is that likely to happen
 
06:05:05.448 --> 06:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
yeah so in a perfect world
 
06:05:07.128 --> 06:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
06:05:10.128 --> 06:05:10.138 align:start position:0%
a Family Division was designed to be one
 
06:05:12.830 --> 06:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
family one judge so the the concept was
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
a judge would be assigned to a case and
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
it would be if there was a divorce case
 
06:05:18.890 --> 06:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
pending that it would be the judge if
 
06:05:20.448 --> 06:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
there was a related abuse neglect that
 
06:05:22.128 --> 06:05:22.138 align:start position:0%
would be the same judge there was a
 
06:05:23.750 --> 06:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency case would be the
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
same judge but the reality is that we
 
06:05:29.570 --> 06:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
have a lot of turnover in our bench we
 
06:05:32.208 --> 06:05:32.218 align:start position:0%
have to move judges around because
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
on any given day I may get a call in the
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
morning or the night before that a judge
 
06:05:38.570 --> 06:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
is out for covet or other related
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
reasons and we have to shuffle judges
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
around so
 
06:05:44.990 --> 06:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think in a best case scenario it would
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
be a judge that would carry through the
 
06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
life of the case but some of these cases
 
06:05:52.010 --> 06:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
go on for years and years too so a judge
 
06:05:54.890 --> 06:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
May retire and somebody else has to come
 
06:05:57.410 --> 06:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
in I just had a case literally that was
 
06:05:59.690 --> 06:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
the case had been pending for 20 years
 
06:06:02.448 --> 06:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
the judge retired and one of the lawyers
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
asked that the judge be specially
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
assigned in his retirement to hear the
 
06:06:07.970 --> 06:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
case and I said because he's because the
 
06:06:09.288 --> 06:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
judge had been hearing this case for 20
 
06:06:11.690 --> 06:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
years they said he's retired I mean I
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
can't force him to come out of
 
06:06:15.650 --> 06:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
retirement to hear this case
 
06:06:18.530 --> 06:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
um that's an extreme example but the
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
reality is that with a turnover and
 
06:06:22.610 --> 06:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
judges and judges covering multiple
 
06:06:25.610 --> 06:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
locations that it's it's not possible to
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
have one judge for one case straight
 
06:06:29.868 --> 06:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
through from beginning to end and you
 
06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
know just to sort of follow up in this
 
06:06:33.410 --> 06:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
because I think that that's um there are
 
06:06:34.850 --> 06:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
a number of questions here that sort of
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
focus on how long Family Division cases
 
06:06:39.890 --> 06:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
take and I know you mentioned before
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
that that the typical and perhaps uh the
 
06:06:46.490 --> 06:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
vast majority of let's say divorce cases
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
are concluded within a year can you just
 
06:06:51.288 --> 06:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
give us without getting into the details
 
06:06:53.090 --> 06:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
of any particular case but can you just
 
06:06:57.548 --> 06:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
give us sort of a um an overview of of
 
06:07:00.708 --> 06:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
what what are the situations that cause
 
06:07:03.650 --> 06:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
a case to go on for like 20 years as you
 
06:07:05.810 --> 06:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
just said what are the what are the sort
 
06:07:08.208 --> 06:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
of dynamics of the situation that causes
 
06:07:09.770 --> 06:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing to happen and what
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and it's and is there something the
 
06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
judge can do to stop that yeah I'll let
 
06:07:17.208 --> 06:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:19.850 --> 06:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
I I can't think of any off-handed or 20
 
06:07:21.410 --> 06:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
years but
 
06:07:23.810 --> 06:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
but I think every judge who works in the
 
06:07:25.610 --> 06:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
Family Division has cases that have gone
 
06:07:27.650 --> 06:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
on longer than they should have gone on
 
06:07:29.330 --> 06:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
in the ideal world
 
06:07:33.170 --> 06:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
some of those cases too are cases in
 
06:07:34.610 --> 06:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
which you've gotten to a final hearing
 
06:07:35.930 --> 06:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
within the period you would hope
 
06:07:38.330 --> 06:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
certainly six months nine months a year
 
06:07:40.250 --> 06:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
if it's a really contested case
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
final orders have been entered but the
 
06:07:43.670 --> 06:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
case may have been brought forward by
 
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
one of the parties
 
06:07:46.970 --> 06:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
and this that's not something we can
 
06:07:49.368 --> 06:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
control there are legal standards that
 
06:07:52.010 --> 06:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
in parenting issues that make the burden
 
06:07:53.930 --> 06:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
of proof more difficult if you bring a
 
06:07:55.970 --> 06:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
case forward from a final parenting plan
 
06:07:57.830 --> 06:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't prevent folks from
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
bringing them forward and there are
 
06:08:03.048 --> 06:08:03.058 align:start position:0%
quite legitimate and reasonable issues
 
06:08:05.330 --> 06:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
too such as a proposed relocation of the
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
children's residents that could prompt
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
the case to be brought forward so I
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
think it's important to distinguish
 
06:08:13.788 --> 06:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
between the question of how long the
 
06:08:16.190 --> 06:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
Family Division gets to a final decree
 
06:08:18.770 --> 06:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
the first time the case is filed and
 
06:08:20.570 --> 06:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
then how we manage a case once it's
 
06:08:22.250 --> 06:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
brought forward because it can be
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
brought forward it seems endlessly I'm
 
06:08:26.930 --> 06:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
sure it seems endless to the parties but
 
06:08:29.030 --> 06:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
it can be brought forward almost at
 
06:08:31.788 --> 06:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
infinitum until typically the children
 
06:08:34.610 --> 06:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
reach age of 18.
 
06:08:36.770 --> 06:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I would say that there are a couple
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
of issues that tend to come up that may
 
06:08:43.490 --> 06:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
cause some delays inherently
 
06:08:45.788 --> 06:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
if the parties are having trouble
 
06:08:48.650 --> 06:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
managing the exchange of information we
 
06:08:50.448 --> 06:08:50.458 align:start position:0%
have a mandatory Discovery rule
 
06:08:52.610 --> 06:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult for folks to
 
06:08:54.288 --> 06:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
get around to doing that
 
06:08:58.010 --> 06:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:00.410 --> 06:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
at loggerheads in terms of the parenting
 
06:09:01.850 --> 06:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
orders even if there are temporary
 
06:09:03.230 --> 06:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
orders in place if they're having
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
trouble complying or their motions for
 
06:09:08.570 --> 06:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
contempt about non-compliance that can
 
06:09:10.610 --> 06:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
always delay the process because we'll
 
06:09:12.590 --> 06:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
schedule a hearing on those motions once
 
06:09:14.650 --> 06:09:14.660 align:start position:0%
the motion and objection is filed
 
06:09:19.010 --> 06:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
it happens sometimes that um in
 
06:09:20.868 --> 06:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
complicated cases particularly
 
06:09:23.330 --> 06:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
complicated Financial cases you'll have
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys on both sides they have to do
 
06:09:27.170 --> 06:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of Discovery in those cases they
 
06:09:30.170 --> 06:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
may have to engage experts to testify to
 
06:09:32.628 --> 06:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
provide opinions that process in itself
 
06:09:35.208 --> 06:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
tends to take longer than the case might
 
06:09:37.970 --> 06:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
otherwise require those are inherent
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
issues with every case and the faces of
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
them change and there are always cases
 
06:09:44.448 --> 06:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
that have a combination of more than one
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
of those features that just make it
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to say to the parties and have
 
06:09:51.230 --> 06:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
them say to the court now we're ready
 
06:09:52.910 --> 06:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
now we're ready to schedule a final
 
06:09:54.890 --> 06:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
hearing we've done what we have to do
 
06:09:56.930 --> 06:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
we're prepared let's go forward and
 
06:09:59.930 --> 06:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
typically the court is not
 
06:10:02.990 --> 06:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
likely we're going to try to time the
 
06:10:04.850 --> 06:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
scheduling of a final hearing at a point
 
06:10:06.830 --> 06:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
where we can trust that the parties are
 
06:10:08.810 --> 06:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
really ready and they need the time
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
because if
 
06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
if the case really doesn't need a full
 
06:10:14.208 --> 06:10:14.218 align:start position:0%
day and we schedule a full day and it
 
06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
turns out that day or the day before
 
06:10:17.990 --> 06:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
that it didn't need a full day and
 
06:10:20.750 --> 06:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
they've settled it we've just spent a
 
06:10:22.368 --> 06:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
day that we may not be able to fill in
 
06:10:25.730 --> 06:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
with other hearings so we we treat our
 
06:10:28.970 --> 06:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
time as valuable and we try to get the
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
litigants to look at it the same way and
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
everyone tries to be practical and
 
06:10:34.250 --> 06:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
realistic about how long the case will
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
take let me follow up on that from
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
another card on the subject we're on
 
06:10:43.368 --> 06:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of a length of time
 
06:10:45.048 --> 06:10:45.058 align:start position:0%
we already spoke of there were not
 
06:10:47.090 --> 06:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
enough judges we it looks like are going
 
06:10:50.930 --> 06:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
to get some more of the ones we need but
 
06:10:53.570 --> 06:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
what about one of the litigants who's
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
churning the process whether it is the
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
wealthy person who can pay a lawyer to
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
tie the other one up with endless
 
06:11:07.128 --> 06:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
motions or somebody who is pro se but
 
06:11:08.690 --> 06:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
has read too much and doesn't understand
 
06:11:11.690 --> 06:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
enough and is doing the same thing when
 
06:11:15.110 --> 06:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
is it proper for the judge to come in
 
06:11:18.048 --> 06:11:18.058 align:start position:0%
and say you're abusing the process
 
06:11:20.750 --> 06:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
in that situation once it becomes
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
apparent that one side or the other is
 
06:11:24.890 --> 06:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
is dragging their heels
 
06:11:27.830 --> 06:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Court's primary focus is going to be
 
06:11:29.390 --> 06:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
on setting deadlines to get the
 
06:11:32.090 --> 06:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
discovery complete once the discovery is
 
06:11:33.650 --> 06:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
complete there's really there should be
 
06:11:35.868 --> 06:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
no impediment to scheduling a final
 
06:11:37.730 --> 06:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
hearing and when they've completed
 
06:11:39.470 --> 06:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Discovery they know what the issues are
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to be and they can tell us if they
 
06:11:42.948 --> 06:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
need a two-hour final hearing or half a
 
06:11:45.288 --> 06:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
day or a full day final hearing so the
 
06:11:48.110 --> 06:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
court I think has an obligation at some
 
06:11:50.390 --> 06:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
point in the in that's in that stage
 
06:11:52.970 --> 06:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
when that's becoming apparent to begin
 
06:11:55.910 --> 06:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
to schedule hearings to set those
 
06:11:58.128 --> 06:11:58.138 align:start position:0%
deadlines to make sure that if there are
 
06:11:59.810 --> 06:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
if there's a need for orders on
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Discovery those orders get out right
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
away and the parties know what their
 
06:12:05.570 --> 06:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
face it I think most attorneys who are
 
06:12:07.368 --> 06:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
experienced in this area will tell you
 
06:12:07.378 --> 06:12:08.570 align:start position:0%
experienced in this area will tell you
that

06:12:08.570 --> 06:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:12:12.410 --> 06:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
the prime time to settle cases is when
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
you get that final hearing schedule
 
06:12:17.150 --> 06:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's what you're preparing for for the
 
06:12:19.310 --> 06:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
client there that's when the expenses
 
06:12:21.230 --> 06:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
are going to go up that's when the
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
uncertainty can be nipped in the bud by
 
06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
a settlement and that's the best time to
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
settle the cases and we're always
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
looking for ways to get them close to
 
06:12:31.010 --> 06:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
that moment the follow-up to that is
 
06:12:35.090 --> 06:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
that if family and divorce issues are
 
06:12:38.890 --> 06:12:38.900 align:start position:0%
not that legislatively mandated priority
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
is one of the ways to speed up a divorce
 
06:12:46.730 --> 06:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
case for the legislature to make that a
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
mandatory priority with a follow-up I'll
 
06:12:52.490 --> 06:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
put in but if everything becomes
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
mandated nothing is then pretty soon
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with that last part of
 
06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
it it's really a policy question whether
 
06:13:01.970 --> 06:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
you impose those sorts of deadlines on
 
06:13:04.670 --> 06:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
us in terms of those cases but
 
06:13:06.970 --> 06:13:06.980 align:start position:0%
in my experience because of the
 
06:13:09.350 --> 06:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
unpredictability of the cases and really
 
06:13:12.170 --> 06:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
the wide spectrum
 
06:13:16.250 --> 06:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
I think there are likely cases that that
 
06:13:18.170 --> 06:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
could never be done
 
06:13:21.770 --> 06:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
properly and fully Within
 
06:13:24.170 --> 06:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
any sort of mandated time constraint
 
06:13:26.090 --> 06:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
there will be those exceptions as judge
 
06:13:28.430 --> 06:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
king mentioned most of our cases get
 
06:13:31.910 --> 06:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
resolved one way or the other we funnel
 
06:13:33.530 --> 06:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
folks into mediation through the first
 
06:13:35.390 --> 06:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
appearance program that's been very
 
06:13:38.030 --> 06:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
successful particularly in resolving the
 
06:13:40.250 --> 06:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
parenting cases that's a that's a high
 
06:13:42.170 --> 06:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
priority for us is to get folks into
 
06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
that process of working together to try
 
06:13:46.490 --> 06:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
to settle the cases as early as we can
 
06:13:49.610 --> 06:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's just these outlier cases that are
 
06:13:51.490 --> 06:13:51.500 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for whatever reason
 
06:13:54.590 --> 06:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming those are going
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
to be very difficult to manage within a
 
06:14:00.048 --> 06:14:00.058 align:start position:0%
mandated period of time
 
06:14:02.330 --> 06:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I wonder if these two sort of
 
06:14:06.708 --> 06:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
related questions the first uh is would
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
better training of Circuit Court judges
 
06:14:10.910 --> 06:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the hours needed by judges to
 
06:14:15.048 --> 06:14:15.058 align:start position:0%
deal with contested family cases
 
06:14:15.058 --> 06:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
deal with contested family cases
um

06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:18.530 --> 06:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh by by reducing the need for
 
06:14:20.990 --> 06:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
re-hearings that kind of thing and then
 
06:14:23.890 --> 06:14:23.900 align:start position:0%
the second sort of related question is
 
06:14:26.208 --> 06:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
can you uh
 
06:14:26.218 --> 06:14:27.850 align:start position:0%
can you uh
uh

06:14:27.850 --> 06:14:27.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:30.948 --> 06:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
take just a bit of time to explain to us
 
06:14:34.430 --> 06:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
the the uh the evaluation process of
 
06:14:37.070 --> 06:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
Judges how judges are evaluated and how
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
often that happens that kind of thing
 
06:14:39.240 --> 06:14:42.128 align:start position:0%
often that happens that kind of thing
foreign

06:14:42.128 --> 06:14:42.138 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:14:45.170 --> 06:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
the first question deals with training
 
06:14:45.180 --> 06:14:46.430 align:start position:0%
the first question deals with training
and

06:14:46.430 --> 06:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:14:48.350 --> 06:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
um that's responsibility of the
 
06:14:50.750 --> 06:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
administrative office and we don't have
 
06:14:52.368 --> 06:14:52.378 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all for judicial
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
training sometimes we'll get two or
 
06:14:56.448 --> 06:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
three judges at once uh and we can put
 
06:14:58.128 --> 06:14:58.138 align:start position:0%
together a more robust training program
 
06:15:00.128 --> 06:15:00.138 align:start position:0%
we're in the process right now of
 
06:15:02.570 --> 06:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
training Judge Amy Manchester she got
 
06:15:05.208 --> 06:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
appointed as a one-off judge and so
 
06:15:06.590 --> 06:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
we've cobbled together a training
 
06:15:08.448 --> 06:15:08.458 align:start position:0%
schedule for her
 
06:15:10.730 --> 06:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
um it's it's harder to bring in outside
 
06:15:14.750 --> 06:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
resources for one judge but we we can
 
06:15:16.730 --> 06:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
never do enough training we do a
 
06:15:19.010 --> 06:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
Judicial training every other month for
 
06:15:21.070 --> 06:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
all of our judges in the Circuit Court
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
could be a topic of any of the three
 
06:15:27.470 --> 06:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
divisions we don't have money to hire
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
outside presenters so we do our own
 
06:15:33.048 --> 06:15:33.058 align:start position:0%
homemade presentations using our judges
 
06:15:35.930 --> 06:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
and staff attorneys and Outsiders as we
 
06:15:37.548 --> 06:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
can get them but I think we can always
 
06:15:41.628 --> 06:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
do more training the second question was
 
06:15:46.090 --> 06:15:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:49.128 --> 06:15:49.138 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a creature of Statute we're
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
required every three years to do a
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
evaluation of all of our judges uh we
 
06:15:56.750 --> 06:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
had a committee that took a deep dive a
 
06:15:58.190 --> 06:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
few years ago representative Smith was
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the committee uh we changed the
 
06:16:03.288 --> 06:16:03.298 align:start position:0%
instrument that we use to do the
 
06:16:04.850 --> 06:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
evaluations we now do them
 
06:16:08.930 --> 06:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
electronically using SurveyMonkey and we
 
06:16:11.030 --> 06:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
Post in the courthouses and in bar news
 
06:16:13.730 --> 06:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
when a certain group of Judges is being
 
06:16:16.670 --> 06:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
evaluated and it's open to anyone who
 
06:16:19.610 --> 06:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
wants to complete the evaluation we
 
06:16:21.770 --> 06:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
typically get anywhere from 30 to 50
 
06:16:25.730 --> 06:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
evaluations back for a judge and then
 
06:16:27.650 --> 06:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's my job to analyze those and go
 
06:16:29.510 --> 06:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
through them with the judge and use
 
06:16:31.490 --> 06:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
those as a tool to help performance
 
06:16:33.910 --> 06:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
by and large the judicial and the
 
06:16:38.990 --> 06:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
results not by judge but the results
 
06:16:42.048 --> 06:16:42.058 align:start position:0%
each year are made available to the
 
06:16:43.548 --> 06:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
governor's office office the House and
 
06:16:45.770 --> 06:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
Senate and are on our website in terms
 
06:16:47.330 --> 06:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
of how many judges were evaluated what
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
the mean and median scores were for all
 
06:16:51.770 --> 06:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
judges and by and large our judges even
 
06:16:53.990 --> 06:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
the judges in the Family Division do
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
pretty well on their performance
 
06:16:55.200 --> 06:16:58.548 align:start position:0%
pretty well on their performance
evaluations

06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:58.558 --> 06:17:04.250 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:17:04.250 --> 06:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:05.868 --> 06:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
as someone who's been through that
 
06:17:07.490 --> 06:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
process quite a bit I would just point
 
06:17:08.810 --> 06:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
out that
 
06:17:12.288 --> 06:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
uh judges don't often get feedback about
 
06:17:13.730 --> 06:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
how they're doing
 
06:17:16.310 --> 06:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
that just for whatever reason
 
06:17:16.320 --> 06:17:17.030 align:start position:0%
that just for whatever reason
um

06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:20.090 --> 06:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're somewhat isolated and attorneys
 
06:17:22.430 --> 06:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
particularly aren't going to come up and
 
06:17:24.470 --> 06:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
tell us often that we've done a terrible
 
06:17:26.208 --> 06:17:26.218 align:start position:0%
job and this is really what we need to
 
06:17:28.128 --> 06:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
refocus on and maybe get some training
 
06:17:28.138 --> 06:17:29.208 align:start position:0%
refocus on and maybe get some training
on

06:17:29.208 --> 06:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
there is a component of the evaluation
 
06:17:34.610 --> 06:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's a self-evaluation and I've always
 
06:17:36.650 --> 06:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
found that extremely valuable because it
 
06:17:38.390 --> 06:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
gives me a chance to sort of second
 
06:17:40.070 --> 06:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
guess what I've been doing and maybe
 
06:17:43.610 --> 06:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
identify areas that I can do better and
 
06:17:46.128 --> 06:17:46.138 align:start position:0%
I think we're still doing it the
 
06:17:48.890 --> 06:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
evaluation process generates
 
06:17:51.948 --> 06:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
a series of particular comments from the
 
06:17:54.170 --> 06:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
evaluators they've been edited so
 
06:17:56.750 --> 06:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're sort of anonymous but comments
 
06:17:59.690 --> 06:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
that can be really helpful for a judge
 
06:18:02.208 --> 06:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
reading over and understanding how
 
06:18:03.830 --> 06:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
someone else perceived how they did
 
06:18:06.470 --> 06:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
their job for me both of those
 
06:18:06.480 --> 06:18:07.910 align:start position:0%
their job for me both of those
components

06:18:07.910 --> 06:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
components
 
06:18:07.920 --> 06:18:08.510 align:start position:0%
components
um

06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
sort of take the edge off what otherwise
 
06:18:12.650 --> 06:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
might be sort of an anxious process of
 
06:18:15.288 --> 06:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
getting evaluated but it does generate
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
great information it's helpful for us in
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
our efforts to do our job better
 
06:18:22.670 --> 06:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a parallel to that
 
06:18:24.708 --> 06:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
could you speak to
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the judicial review I mean this this
 
06:18:30.230 --> 06:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
is a bit of training but I mean the
 
06:18:32.750 --> 06:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process
 
06:18:35.810 --> 06:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
of when it is alleged that a judge has
 
06:18:41.510 --> 06:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.190 --> 06:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if I understand the
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman but there were
 
06:18:46.910 --> 06:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
there were two two avenues that that can
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
go if I know a situation where there is
 
06:18:52.610 --> 06:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
an allegation that the judges in an
 
06:18:54.948 --> 06:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
order made an error of law
 
06:18:57.288 --> 06:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
that goes to Chief Justice McDonald's
 
06:18:59.270 --> 06:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
court and they review that as part of
 
06:19:01.128 --> 06:19:01.138 align:start position:0%
the Appellate process and they either
 
06:19:02.690 --> 06:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
affirm the judge or they reverse the
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
judge the second component deals more
 
06:19:07.850 --> 06:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
with behavioral issues on the part of a
 
06:19:09.230 --> 06:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
judge which is maybe what you're getting
 
06:19:12.650 --> 06:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
at there is a Judicial conduct committee
 
06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh Robert middleholtzer is the chairman
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
of that it has a number of members both
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
from the public and the court system and
 
06:19:22.150 --> 06:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
they meet monthly and they review
 
06:19:24.910 --> 06:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
complaints if you will against judges
 
06:19:28.430 --> 06:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I I get copies of all of them as
 
06:19:29.690 --> 06:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
they make their way through to the end
 
06:19:32.170 --> 06:19:32.180 align:start position:0%
of the process and by and large
 
06:19:35.628 --> 06:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
most of the complaints against judges
 
06:19:38.448 --> 06:19:38.458 align:start position:0%
that I see in the Circuit Court are
 
06:19:41.090 --> 06:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
Judges who sit in primarily in the
 
06:19:43.730 --> 06:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
Family Division they involve mostly
 
06:19:46.010 --> 06:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting cases and for the most
 
06:19:48.490 --> 06:19:48.500 align:start position:0%
part they go to the merits of the case
 
06:19:52.368 --> 06:19:52.378 align:start position:0%
that the you know the judge came up with
 
06:19:54.048 --> 06:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision if you will which is
 
06:19:55.910 --> 06:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
really something that should go to the
 
06:19:58.548 --> 06:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court if that's the issue if
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
it rises to a serious enough level it's
 
06:20:02.570 --> 06:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
it becomes a public complaint and
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
there's a whole process for that for the
 
06:20:06.948 --> 06:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee and they too
 
06:20:08.930 --> 06:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
report their findings at the end of
 
06:20:10.730 --> 06:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
every year how many complaints they
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
received how many resulted in certain
 
06:20:15.948 --> 06:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
outcomes so that's that's a public and
 
06:20:18.410 --> 06:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
transparent process the complaints are
 
06:20:20.628 --> 06:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
confidential until they erase the level
 
06:20:22.910 --> 06:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
of a complaint by the committee could
 
06:20:26.448 --> 06:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
you try to remember a recent year and
 
06:20:29.330 --> 06:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
give us the number of complaints and the
 
06:20:33.368 --> 06:20:33.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:38.270 --> 06:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
dismissed for not being what would go
 
06:20:41.690 --> 06:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
forward with any action I I'm losing the
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
term I'm striving for here yeah since
 
06:20:44.750 --> 06:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a function that's
 
06:20:46.430 --> 06:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
outside of the judicial branch I don't
 
06:20:48.410 --> 06:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
have those numbers at hand I I they are
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
available there's a link on the Supreme
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
on our judicial branch website to the
 
06:20:55.070 --> 06:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee and I think
 
06:20:57.650 --> 06:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
those statistics are available but I'll
 
06:21:00.048 --> 06:21:00.058 align:start position:0%
follow up and see if I can get the most
 
06:21:02.090 --> 06:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
recent report
 
06:21:04.548 --> 06:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
but this is an external it sounds like
 
06:21:06.350 --> 06:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
when you said you didn't have that
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
information that means this is somewhat
 
06:21:10.070 --> 06:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
of an external
 
06:21:13.010 --> 06:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
Review Committee it is external to the
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch it's not the guys
 
06:21:21.048 --> 06:21:21.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:24.110 --> 06:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is I think an important
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
topic would you please talk about
 
06:21:29.570 --> 06:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
mediation and its effect on caseloads
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
and the weighted caseload study are
 
06:21:34.910 --> 06:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
there impediments to structural
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
mediation such as not enough mediators
 
06:21:41.810 --> 06:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:44.090 --> 06:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
so I can start and maybe judge Garner
 
06:21:45.530 --> 06:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
can talk more specifically about Family
 
06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
Division the office of mediation and
 
06:21:51.470 --> 06:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
arbitration Works uh out of the judicial
 
06:21:54.170 --> 06:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
branch and we have mediation pretty much
 
06:21:57.890 --> 06:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
across all case types some are available
 
06:22:00.590 --> 06:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
at no charge to litigants some have a
 
06:22:02.270 --> 06:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
sliding scale I think in the Family
 
06:22:06.770 --> 06:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
Division and I think all judges strongly
 
06:22:09.288 --> 06:22:09.298 align:start position:0%
encourage various forms of alternative
 
06:22:12.110 --> 06:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution mediation being the
 
06:22:15.890 --> 06:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
primary one it's required in all cases
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
involving parenting cases where the
 
06:22:20.510 --> 06:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
parents are required to go to mediation
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much out of the gate to try to
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
get those issues resolved and it's
 
06:22:26.270 --> 06:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
highly effective I mean the the success
 
06:22:30.230 --> 06:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
rates are are pretty high in the Circuit
 
06:22:31.490 --> 06:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
Court we also have something called
 
06:22:33.590 --> 06:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation
 
06:22:36.410 --> 06:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
which has kind of fallen off because we
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
rely on judicial officers to do it but
 
06:22:42.230 --> 06:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is where a judge
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
who is not going to hear the case sits
 
06:22:47.090 --> 06:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
down for a half day or a day with the
 
06:22:49.010 --> 06:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
parties depending on the complexity of
 
06:22:51.770 --> 06:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
the case and you sort of have a almost a
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
mini trial without Witnesses and at the
 
06:22:57.048 --> 06:22:57.058 align:start position:0%
end of the process the judge tells the
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
parties how he or she thinks if they
 
06:23:00.410 --> 06:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
were to have heard the case it would
 
06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
come out so just for example you know
 
06:23:05.270 --> 06:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
let's say it's an alimony issue at the
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
end the judge says you know I think this
 
06:23:08.810 --> 06:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
is a situation where if I were the judge
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
hearing this case based on what I've
 
06:23:13.250 --> 06:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
heard I would be ordering alimony it may
 
06:23:14.570 --> 06:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
be a case where the lawyer's been
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
telling his or her client you're going
 
06:23:18.110 --> 06:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
to pay alimony and they're saying no I'm
 
06:23:20.208 --> 06:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
not and the lawyer's saying yes you are
 
06:23:22.490 --> 06:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
and so you go to neutral case evaluation
 
06:23:25.788 --> 06:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
and experienced judicial officer you
 
06:23:27.170 --> 06:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
know being versed in the law and having
 
06:23:28.490 --> 06:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
heard the facts
 
06:23:30.670 --> 06:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
says what they think would happen
 
06:23:33.708 --> 06:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is a really good way to
 
06:23:35.930 --> 06:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
get those more difficult cases to settle
 
06:23:38.390 --> 06:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
I did a neutral case evaluation during
 
06:23:40.670 --> 06:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
covid in a trust docket case that
 
06:23:43.010 --> 06:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
involved multi-millions of dollars we
 
06:23:45.410 --> 06:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
had lots of lawyers we started at 8 30
 
06:23:47.810 --> 06:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
in the morning I left the law office at
 
06:23:49.730 --> 06:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
8 30 that night it was a Friday night we
 
06:23:53.690 --> 06:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
spent 12 hours and ultimately and this
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
was a case that had gone to mediation
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and and didn't settle ultimately because
 
06:24:00.410 --> 06:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
I was a judge and I have experience in
 
06:24:02.150 --> 06:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
this area of the law
 
06:24:04.190 --> 06:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I was able to tell the parties what
 
06:24:06.128 --> 06:24:06.138 align:start position:0%
I think is going to happen in this case
 
06:24:09.470 --> 06:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
including how the legal fees which were
 
06:24:11.090 --> 06:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
in the millions of dollars might get
 
06:24:13.490 --> 06:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
apportioned if I were to hear the case
 
06:24:16.190 --> 06:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
the parties were able to work with their
 
06:24:18.350 --> 06:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
lawyers and get that case resolved
 
06:24:20.270 --> 06:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
that case was scheduled for an eight-day
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
trial in two weeks and so I called the
 
06:24:25.128 --> 06:24:25.138 align:start position:0%
judge when I got home that night and
 
06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
said you owe me one because I just
 
06:24:28.850 --> 06:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
settled an eight-day trial for you but
 
06:24:31.190 --> 06:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is a very good
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
tool and we would like to expand that in
 
06:24:35.570 --> 06:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
the Family Division as we have the
 
06:24:40.788 --> 06:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
part of it let me just supplement a
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
little bit with a specific procedure
 
06:24:47.090 --> 06:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
that applies in divorce cases with
 
06:24:49.250 --> 06:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
children and parenting cases
 
06:24:51.288 --> 06:24:51.298 align:start position:0%
when the petition is filed and assuming
 
06:24:53.270 --> 06:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
that there are no emergency orders that
 
06:24:55.670 --> 06:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
are involved the parties are sent to
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
what we call the first appearance
 
06:24:57.360 --> 06:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
what we call the first appearance
session

06:24:59.110 --> 06:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:25:01.368 --> 06:25:01.378 align:start position:0%
pre-covered we were doing these sessions
 
06:25:04.190 --> 06:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
live so typically in the courtroom where
 
06:25:06.110 --> 06:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm able to sit in Laconia we can seat
 
06:25:08.810 --> 06:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
about 25 people we'd have 10 or 12
 
06:25:11.570 --> 06:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
couples come in and they would get
 
06:25:13.788 --> 06:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
directly from me or from whatever judge
 
06:25:15.948 --> 06:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
was doing at that day a basic
 
06:25:18.230 --> 06:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
description of the process the procedure
 
06:25:20.090 --> 06:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
of this involved mention of the
 
06:25:22.490 --> 06:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
mandatory Discovery Rule and a lot of
 
06:25:24.948 --> 06:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
information about mediation and the
 
06:25:28.910 --> 06:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
presumption is and was from that process
 
06:25:31.490 --> 06:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
that unless there was a reason to be
 
06:25:33.590 --> 06:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
exempt from it the parties would go to
 
06:25:35.448 --> 06:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
mediation before they would come back to
 
06:25:38.030 --> 06:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
court for any contested hearings and we
 
06:25:40.128 --> 06:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
had great success at that I should
 
06:25:41.930 --> 06:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
mention as a footnote that there is an
 
06:25:43.670 --> 06:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
exception for cases where there's a
 
06:25:45.410 --> 06:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective order in
 
06:25:49.548 --> 06:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
effect in those cases we can send the
 
06:25:51.288 --> 06:25:51.298 align:start position:0%
parties to mediation but only if they
 
06:25:53.208 --> 06:25:53.218 align:start position:0%
both agree either one of them gets a
 
06:25:55.548 --> 06:25:55.558 align:start position:0%
veto power and those mediation sessions
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
always occur at the courthouse we've
 
06:25:59.090 --> 06:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
been doing the first appearance
 
06:26:01.368 --> 06:26:01.378 align:start position:0%
questions remotely now because there's a
 
06:26:03.830 --> 06:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
video that the judicial branch created
 
06:26:07.010 --> 06:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
for us we've candidly with speakers who
 
06:26:08.510 --> 06:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
are a lot more effective at it than I
 
06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
was doing it live although I still think
 
06:26:12.708 --> 06:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
there was some benefit to having it live
 
06:26:15.770 --> 06:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
but it's been a great program and our
 
06:26:15.780 --> 06:26:17.090 align:start position:0%
but it's been a great program and our
mediators

06:26:17.090 --> 06:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
mediators
 
06:26:19.430 --> 06:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a place like Laconia we've been using
 
06:26:21.470 --> 06:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
the same mediators for years and they
 
06:26:23.690 --> 06:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
are fully expert at what they do and
 
06:26:25.490 --> 06:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're very nice people and they create
 
06:26:27.530 --> 06:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
an atmosphere there's much more
 
06:26:29.570 --> 06:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
congenial and productive than the sort
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
of formal courtroom atmosphere that
 
06:26:32.930 --> 06:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
they're going to be facing if the
 
06:26:34.970 --> 06:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
mediation doesn't work out so it's been
 
06:26:36.470 --> 06:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
a great program and we completely
 
06:26:38.510 --> 06:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
encourage it
 
06:26:40.730 --> 06:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
so this I
 
06:26:42.110 --> 06:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I think this is
 
06:26:45.970 --> 06:26:45.980 align:start position:0%
this is a a point that needs to be made
 
06:26:49.190 --> 06:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
can you just explain to us let's talk
 
06:26:50.810 --> 06:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
about I'm not talking about part-time
 
06:26:53.330 --> 06:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
judges but a full-time judge can you
 
06:26:56.330 --> 06:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
just explain our full-time judges
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
permitted to have any other employment
 
06:27:02.750 --> 06:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
and are there any are there limits on a
 
06:27:05.170 --> 06:27:05.180 align:start position:0%
judge's ability to earn income
 
06:27:10.490 --> 06:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:10.500 --> 06:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:27:11.750 --> 06:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
there is a limitation judges are allowed
 
06:27:16.628 --> 06:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:27:19.250 --> 06:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
teaching I think is pretty much the only
 
06:27:21.048 --> 06:27:21.058 align:start position:0%
outside employment that they're allowed
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
to do only with the permission written
 
06:27:25.368 --> 06:27:25.378 align:start position:0%
permission of the Chief Justice and
 
06:27:27.230 --> 06:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
their salary cannot exceed I think it's
 
06:27:31.548 --> 06:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
15 of the judge's salary
 
06:27:33.288 --> 06:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
um I just I can tell you from experience
 
06:27:35.090 --> 06:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court judges don't have time
 
06:27:36.470 --> 06:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
06:27:36.480 --> 06:27:37.128 align:start position:0%
to teach
um

06:27:37.128 --> 06:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:39.590 --> 06:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not sure if we have any uh
 
06:27:41.448 --> 06:27:41.458 align:start position:0%
active I think we may have some judges
 
06:27:43.610 --> 06:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
who teach uh trial ad at the law school
 
06:27:45.110 --> 06:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
some Superior Court judges and I think
 
06:27:46.250 --> 06:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
we might have one circuit court judge
 
06:27:48.470 --> 06:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
that does it but it's pretty Limited
 
06:27:50.930 --> 06:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
can't practice law at all under rule 38
 
06:27:53.330 --> 06:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
which is the code of judicial conduct
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
I want to follow up on the judicial
 
06:27:58.070 --> 06:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
conduct committee uh the questionnaire
 
06:28:00.048 --> 06:28:00.058 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if this is correct or
 
06:28:02.868 --> 06:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
not I'll just read the card why do the
 
06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
members of the judicial conduct
 
06:28:07.250 --> 06:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee number one not have to take an
 
06:28:09.410 --> 06:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
oath of office I'm not sure what that
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
means and secondly and I know the answer
 
06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
to this one had there why do they have
 
06:28:15.890 --> 06:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
their meetings in secret
 
06:28:18.650 --> 06:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
well by rule the process is confidential
 
06:28:20.330 --> 06:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
unless as I said earlier the complaint
 
06:28:22.310 --> 06:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
the the cases risen to the level of a
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
complaint I have no idea whether they
 
06:28:26.030 --> 06:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
take an oath of office or not
 
06:28:28.250 --> 06:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know why they
 
06:28:30.350 --> 06:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know why they would but they not
 
06:28:33.048 --> 06:28:33.058 align:start position:0%
I don't know that they do or don't in
 
06:28:34.970 --> 06:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
terms of meetings in secret
 
06:28:37.010 --> 06:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
if I was accused of something I would
 
06:28:39.770 --> 06:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
want it to be substantiated before I
 
06:28:41.930 --> 06:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
read about it in the union later
 
06:28:43.548 --> 06:28:43.558 align:start position:0%
you know you wouldn't read about in the
 
06:28:44.990 --> 06:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
union leader until it was risen to the
 
06:28:46.490 --> 06:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
level of the complaint and then the
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
process is the judge gets the complaint
 
06:28:51.288 --> 06:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
and has 30 days to respond to it and
 
06:28:52.610 --> 06:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
then the committee sort of takes off
 
06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
from there so at the end of the case the
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
judge always gets a copy and the
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
resolution but
 
06:29:02.208 --> 06:29:02.218 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't want a judge to know in
 
06:29:03.410 --> 06:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
the middle of a case that someone would
 
06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
file a complaint so there's two sides to
 
06:29:09.530 --> 06:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:09.540 --> 06:29:10.970 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:29:10.970 --> 06:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:29:10.980 --> 06:29:11.810 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:29:11.810 --> 06:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:15.830 --> 06:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
this this uh the questioner asks why are
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
Judges not ending cases
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
um sooner and allowing frivolous motions
 
06:29:26.090 --> 06:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the question I so I put
 
06:29:29.448 --> 06:29:29.458 align:start position:0%
it to to you uh you know what is that is
 
06:29:32.628 --> 06:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
that true and uh what what you know what
 
06:29:36.410 --> 06:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
why what are the processes for for sort
 
06:29:36.420 --> 06:29:37.368 align:start position:0%
why what are the processes for for sort
of

06:29:37.368 --> 06:29:37.378 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
truncating cases that seem to go on
 
06:29:39.840 --> 06:29:44.570 align:start position:0%
truncating cases that seem to go on
forever

06:29:44.570 --> 06:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
the question of frivolity I think may be
 
06:29:49.430 --> 06:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
something that's uh in the eye of the
 
06:29:49.440 --> 06:29:50.628 align:start position:0%
something that's uh in the eye of the
beholder

06:29:50.628 --> 06:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
beholder
 
06:29:53.570 --> 06:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation to move the
 
06:29:56.930 --> 06:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
cases along and to provide good orders
 
06:29:58.910 --> 06:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable and fair period of
 
06:29:58.920 --> 06:29:59.690 align:start position:0%
within a reasonable and fair period of
time

06:29:59.690 --> 06:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:30:02.750 --> 06:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
and so to the extent that motions to us
 
06:30:04.610 --> 06:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
appear to be frivolous
 
06:30:07.610 --> 06:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
will typically make a finding we may
 
06:30:10.850 --> 06:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
make immediate rulings on those sorts of
 
06:30:14.090 --> 06:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
motions so to convey the message at some
 
06:30:16.368 --> 06:30:16.378 align:start position:0%
point in the process I think we have
 
06:30:18.350 --> 06:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
authority although I think it's rarely
 
06:30:18.360 --> 06:30:19.430 align:start position:0%
authority although I think it's rarely
used

06:30:19.430 --> 06:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
used
 
06:30:23.208 --> 06:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
to limit A party's right to file
 
06:30:25.430 --> 06:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
additional motions I don't know that
 
06:30:29.330 --> 06:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
we're ever going to be able to justify
 
06:30:31.490 --> 06:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
preventing a party from filing some
 
06:30:33.530 --> 06:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
things that's an access to justice issue
 
06:30:35.930 --> 06:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
that is really fundamental to what we do
 
06:30:39.070 --> 06:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
but we can impose sanctions and we can
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
impose requirements on filings that will
 
06:30:45.530 --> 06:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
to some degree enhance the likelihood
 
06:30:46.910 --> 06:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the Motions are not going to be
 
06:30:49.670 --> 06:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
frivolous in terms of resolving the
 
06:30:52.310 --> 06:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
cases sooner
 
06:30:54.170 --> 06:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think there are two processes there
 
06:30:58.190 --> 06:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
one is the process of our workload so
 
06:31:00.770 --> 06:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
currently if you were to have a
 
06:31:03.230 --> 06:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial conference with us today and
 
06:31:04.910 --> 06:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
you needed a full day final hearing
 
06:31:06.830 --> 06:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're scheduling about three months out
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
of it so that's that's time you're going
 
06:31:09.948 --> 06:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
to wait to get to that hearing with
 
06:31:12.410 --> 06:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
nothing else going on
 
06:31:15.830 --> 06:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
but there are also
 
06:31:20.510 --> 06:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
cases in which we can intervene if you
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
will or help the parties uh in a
 
06:31:25.730 --> 06:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
direction of mediation or neutral case
 
06:31:28.128 --> 06:31:28.138 align:start position:0%
evaluation that may help the case get
 
06:31:30.890 --> 06:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
resolved sooner it's in our interest and
 
06:31:32.628 --> 06:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's certainly in the party's interests
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
to get cases resolved as soon as they
 
06:31:36.650 --> 06:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
can be fairly resolved meaning that all
 
06:31:38.570 --> 06:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
the relevant information is available to
 
06:31:41.330 --> 06:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
them to present and meaning that they've
 
06:31:43.070 --> 06:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
exhausted all the possibilities of
 
06:31:43.080 --> 06:31:44.390 align:start position:0%
exhausted all the possibilities of
negotiation

06:31:44.390 --> 06:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
06:31:47.330 --> 06:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
so I think we have a common goal with
 
06:31:49.730 --> 06:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
folks in that our workload is a bit of
 
06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
an impediment in terms of the time we
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
have available and the nature of some of
 
06:31:57.530 --> 06:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
the cases makes it basically challenging
 
06:32:00.590 --> 06:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
to get them ready for a final Hearing in
 
06:32:04.670 --> 06:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
a in a brief period of time
 
06:32:07.970 --> 06:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
I wonder if the next question which I
 
06:32:10.610 --> 06:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
think judge Garner you may have touched
 
06:32:12.948 --> 06:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
on this a little bit earlier but
 
06:32:14.810 --> 06:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
um could you could any of you really
 
06:32:18.770 --> 06:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
give us your thoughts on what what would
 
06:32:20.510 --> 06:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
be the effect
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
if that's a general matter in family law
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
cases the burden of proof were elevated
 
06:32:30.350 --> 06:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
in other words instead of preponderance
 
06:32:31.910 --> 06:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the evidence which is generally the
 
06:32:34.010 --> 06:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
standard that applies it were elevated
 
06:32:36.048 --> 06:32:36.058 align:start position:0%
to either clear and convincing evidence
 
06:32:38.810 --> 06:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
or proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt what
 
06:32:41.090 --> 06:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
can you just tell us what your sense of
 
06:32:44.448 --> 06:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
what the effect of that would be
 
06:32:46.850 --> 06:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
the clear and convincing standard is
 
06:32:48.890 --> 06:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
already in place in cases that are
 
06:32:50.570 --> 06:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
brought forward on parenting issues so
 
06:32:54.470 --> 06:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
under 461a 11 1 at least two of those
 
06:32:56.750 --> 06:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
subsections require clear and convincing
 
06:32:59.090 --> 06:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
evidence before the court can modify an
 
06:33:01.430 --> 06:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
existing parenting plan so it's not a
 
06:33:04.070 --> 06:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
standard that we're unused to
 
06:33:06.830 --> 06:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's a I think a difficult standard to
 
06:33:10.610 --> 06:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
articulate for uh for parties who are
 
06:33:10.620 --> 06:33:12.170 align:start position:0%
articulate for uh for parties who are
self-represented

06:33:12.170 --> 06:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
self-represented
 
06:33:12.180 --> 06:33:13.490 align:start position:0%
self-represented
and

06:33:13.490 --> 06:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:13.500 --> 06:33:14.690 align:start position:0%
and
um

06:33:14.690 --> 06:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:16.990 --> 06:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
to some degree the there is no
 
06:33:20.510 --> 06:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
particular burden of proof in the first
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
the first time around in Family Division
 
06:33:24.410 --> 06:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
cases there's a presumption of joint
 
06:33:26.570 --> 06:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
decision making there's a presumption
 
06:33:28.490 --> 06:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
that regular and frequent contact with
 
06:33:30.170 --> 06:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
children is consistent with their best
 
06:33:33.110 --> 06:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
interests and the standard for orders
 
06:33:34.910 --> 06:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
that relate to Children is what's in the
 
06:33:37.610 --> 06:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child rather than a
 
06:33:39.230 --> 06:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
formal assignment of burden of proof to
 
06:33:40.788 --> 06:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
one side or the other
 
06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
so I think it starts with a More Level
 
06:33:44.510 --> 06:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
Playing Field if
 
06:33:46.850 --> 06:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
there's no reason in my view to require
 
06:33:49.010 --> 06:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
parties both to prove something by
 
06:33:50.690 --> 06:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
clearing convincing evidence the first
 
06:33:53.330 --> 06:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
time around the statutory standard in
 
06:33:56.150 --> 06:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
for modification of parenting is there
 
06:33:59.990 --> 06:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
because the legislature recognized that
 
06:34:02.030 --> 06:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
stability is really important for
 
06:34:03.948 --> 06:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
children they wanted to make it a little
 
06:34:05.930 --> 06:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
more difficult for someone seeking to
 
06:34:09.048 --> 06:34:09.058 align:start position:0%
modify a parenting plan to come back and
 
06:34:11.448 --> 06:34:11.458 align:start position:0%
and get a modification so they impose
 
06:34:12.830 --> 06:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
that standard under those two
 
06:34:12.840 --> 06:34:14.330 align:start position:0%
that standard under those two
subsections

06:34:14.330 --> 06:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
subsections
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
so beyond a reasonable doubt I I won't
 
06:34:18.530 --> 06:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
address that I
 
06:34:22.030 --> 06:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:24.288 --> 06:34:24.298 align:start position:0%
the next question I I think this is
 
06:34:26.390 --> 06:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
really a this is a valid one why did the
 
06:34:28.850 --> 06:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
court system not request in the budget
 
06:34:30.650 --> 06:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
the number of Judges indicated by the
 
06:34:33.700 --> 06:34:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:33.710 --> 06:34:37.610 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:34:37.610 --> 06:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:39.590 --> 06:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
it is a valid question
 
06:34:39.600 --> 06:34:41.090 align:start position:0%
it is a valid question
um

06:34:41.090 --> 06:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
we we and I want to be clear this is we
 
06:34:49.368 --> 06:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
our request this year is a significant
 
06:34:53.990 --> 06:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
step towards addressing or uh needs but
 
06:34:56.448 --> 06:34:56.458 align:start position:0%
it's not the final step and we're also
 
06:34:59.930 --> 06:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
mindful of the larger context in which
 
06:35:01.850 --> 06:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
we operate and we try to be good
 
06:35:05.030 --> 06:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
partners in state government and uh good
 
06:35:07.368 --> 06:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
stewards of the taxpayers dollars
 
06:35:10.310 --> 06:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and all of those factors played into
 
06:35:12.650 --> 06:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
our ultimate decision to ask for seven
 
06:35:14.628 --> 06:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court and one in the
 
06:35:17.030 --> 06:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
06:35:19.910 --> 06:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:22.368 --> 06:35:22.378 align:start position:0%
um and and you know by the time we're
 
06:35:24.230 --> 06:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
developing our next budget we'll have
 
06:35:26.030 --> 06:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
better we'll have
 
06:35:29.810 --> 06:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
good insight as to hopefully or how our
 
06:35:32.090 --> 06:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
additional resources are helping our
 
06:35:33.770 --> 06:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
caseload and we'll be able to come back
 
06:35:36.410 --> 06:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
to the legislature again informed with
 
06:35:39.170 --> 06:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
with whether what what further
 
06:35:44.330 --> 06:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:47.208 --> 06:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
can um I wonder uh maybe this would be
 
06:35:51.830 --> 06:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
for you judge king of the of the 126
 
06:35:55.730 --> 06:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
000 or so uh circuit court cases can you
 
06:35:58.070 --> 06:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
give us a rough idea of approximately
 
06:35:59.948 --> 06:35:59.958 align:start position:0%
how many are
 
06:36:02.330 --> 06:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
dcyf related in other words that have
 
06:36:03.530 --> 06:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
the division
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh children for children youth and
 
06:36:09.890 --> 06:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
families involved uh at some level
 
06:36:12.048 --> 06:36:12.058 align:start position:0%
so you
 
06:36:13.970 --> 06:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
talking pretty much about abuse neglect
 
06:36:17.208 --> 06:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
and and delinquency cases
 
06:36:20.330 --> 06:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll use uh 2020 two numbers
 
06:36:20.340 --> 06:36:21.330 align:start position:0%
um and so I'll use uh 2020 two numbers
uh

06:36:21.330 --> 06:36:21.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:36:21.340 --> 06:36:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

06:36:31.510 --> 06:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:33.970 --> 06:36:33.980 align:start position:0%
looks like about
 
06:36:38.868 --> 06:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
2600 cases in 2022 would have involved
 
06:36:40.850 --> 06:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
the division directly
 
06:36:42.770 --> 06:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
well and then there's another 560
 
06:36:44.510 --> 06:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
determination of parental rights cases
 
06:36:46.310 --> 06:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
which that's sort of the back end of the
 
06:36:48.890 --> 06:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect typically so
 
06:36:51.770 --> 06:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
um north of 3000 cases
 
06:36:55.128 --> 06:36:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:55.138 --> 06:37:08.170 align:start position:0%
 
yep

06:37:08.170 --> 06:37:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:11.150 --> 06:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think on slide eight if you look at
 
06:37:15.230 --> 06:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
the Circle to identified as juvenile
 
06:37:18.788 --> 06:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
yep identifies the number of case
 
06:37:21.170 --> 06:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
juvenile related cases for the years
 
06:37:24.590 --> 06:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
that we use for the little kids load
 
06:37:24.600 --> 06:37:27.530 align:start position:0%
that we use for the little kids load
study

06:37:27.530 --> 06:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:30.650 --> 06:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
um the next question uh do judges still
 
06:37:30.660 --> 06:37:32.288 align:start position:0%
um the next question uh do judges still
order

06:37:32.288 --> 06:37:32.298 align:start position:0%
order
 
06:37:35.570 --> 06:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
parent-child unification therapy and if
 
06:37:40.090 --> 06:37:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:43.660 --> 06:37:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:43.670 --> 06:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:37:46.670 --> 06:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:37:50.208 --> 06:37:50.218 align:start position:0%
that process is not currently
 
06:37:52.190 --> 06:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
unavailable to us
 
06:37:54.048 --> 06:37:54.058 align:start position:0%
but there are some elements of the
 
06:37:57.708 --> 06:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
process that make it extremely rare
 
06:38:01.548 --> 06:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
if I understand the process it is that a
 
06:38:03.530 --> 06:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
reunification therapist
 
06:38:06.288 --> 06:38:06.298 align:start position:0%
is appointed presumably with the consent
 
06:38:09.410 --> 06:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
of the parties but by order of the Court
 
06:38:12.048 --> 06:38:12.058 align:start position:0%
to conduct a reunification therapy to
 
06:38:14.288 --> 06:38:14.298 align:start position:0%
allow and enhance and encourage a child
 
06:38:18.048 --> 06:38:18.058 align:start position:0%
to reunify with one parent the question
 
06:38:20.208 --> 06:38:20.218 align:start position:0%
of the word reunification is a bit
 
06:38:23.330 --> 06:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
ambiguous whether it means just some
 
06:38:25.010 --> 06:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
regular contact or whether it means a
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
full reunification under a shared
 
06:38:29.150 --> 06:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
residential schedule but it's a process
 
06:38:31.368 --> 06:38:31.378 align:start position:0%
in which typically there are there's a
 
06:38:32.930 --> 06:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
therapist or the child
 
06:38:34.910 --> 06:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
there may be a therapist for the parent
 
06:38:36.948 --> 06:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
but there's a reunification therapist
 
06:38:40.670 --> 06:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
who provides the Forum and provides some
 
06:38:42.590 --> 06:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
of the therapy and helps all of them
 
06:38:44.570 --> 06:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
work together to try to reunify their
 
06:38:44.580 --> 06:38:45.890 align:start position:0%
work together to try to reunify their
relationship

06:38:45.890 --> 06:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
06:38:49.150 --> 06:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
06:38:53.628 --> 06:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
an intense pretty intense process it's I
 
06:38:56.150 --> 06:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
think rarely used it's probably an
 
06:38:58.610 --> 06:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
expensive process and I'll say as a
 
06:39:00.410 --> 06:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
caveat I've never had a case where I've
 
06:39:02.868 --> 06:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
actually presided over the process
 
06:39:02.878 --> 06:39:04.610 align:start position:0%
actually presided over the process
although

06:39:04.610 --> 06:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
although
 
06:39:04.620 --> 06:39:05.208 align:start position:0%
although
um

06:39:05.208 --> 06:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:07.368 --> 06:39:07.378 align:start position:0%
is not completely unknown to me because
 
06:39:08.750 --> 06:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
of some things that have come up in
 
06:39:10.010 --> 06:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
other cases but I won't mention
 
06:39:13.310 --> 06:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
specifically but it's a
 
06:39:15.590 --> 06:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's a process in which I think some of
 
06:39:18.770 --> 06:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
the therapists have great faith and it
 
06:39:20.170 --> 06:39:20.180 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:39:22.430 --> 06:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
just thinking globally it would be
 
06:39:24.048 --> 06:39:24.058 align:start position:0%
something that would be used in the rare
 
06:39:26.868 --> 06:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
occasion and often as virtually a last
 
06:39:29.448 --> 06:39:29.458 align:start position:0%
resort when the relationship between a
 
06:39:31.190 --> 06:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
parent and a child for whatever reason
 
06:39:34.128 --> 06:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
is so distant and so is strange that
 
06:39:36.708 --> 06:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
without professional input and
 
06:39:39.170 --> 06:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
professional assistance it may not be
 
06:39:39.180 --> 06:39:41.090 align:start position:0%
professional assistance it may not be
salvageable

06:39:41.090 --> 06:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
salvageable
 
06:39:43.548 --> 06:39:43.558 align:start position:0%
so that's my quick take I'll know more
 
06:39:45.350 --> 06:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
if I ever get to a series of hearings
 
06:39:47.690 --> 06:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
that involve that but that's my
 
06:39:49.490 --> 06:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process and and
 
06:39:52.368 --> 06:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
some of the pitfalls
 
06:39:54.530 --> 06:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh judge king I think this probably
 
06:39:56.390 --> 06:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be the best the best address to
 
06:39:58.610 --> 06:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
you um
 
06:40:00.590 --> 06:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned I think earlier in your
 
06:40:02.890 --> 06:40:02.900 align:start position:0%
remarks that uh there were no more
 
06:40:07.670 --> 06:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
marital Masters um on the bench um
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh they that that many of them had
 
06:40:12.650 --> 06:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
retired and then I apparently at some
 
06:40:14.570 --> 06:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
point at some point later you mentioned
 
06:40:17.390 --> 06:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
that um uh some marital masses had
 
06:40:19.250 --> 06:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
become judges in fact I think judge
 
06:40:20.750 --> 06:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
Garner so could you just can you just
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
kind of explain how I mean is it is that
 
06:40:23.280 --> 06:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
kind of explain how I mean is it is that
a

06:40:24.230 --> 06:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:40:27.350 --> 06:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
a sort of usual course or when we did
 
06:40:29.390 --> 06:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
have marital Masters was it was is that
 
06:40:31.250 --> 06:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
something that you know to go from being
 
06:40:32.868 --> 06:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
a marital Master to a judge to something
 
06:40:34.970 --> 06:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
that happened in with some some
 
06:40:34.980 --> 06:40:36.948 align:start position:0%
that happened in with some some
regularity

06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
regularity
 
06:40:39.230 --> 06:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think it was probably unheard of until
 
06:40:41.750 --> 06:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
we created the Circuit Court back when
 
06:40:44.270 --> 06:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court had jurisdiction over
 
06:40:46.490 --> 06:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
divorces before you cleverly pass them
 
06:40:47.868 --> 06:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
on to us
 
06:40:47.878 --> 06:40:48.770 align:start position:0%
on to us
um

06:40:48.770 --> 06:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:50.390 --> 06:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think the marital Masters were
 
06:40:52.010 --> 06:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
creation of the Superior Court initially
 
06:40:53.810 --> 06:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
because the judges didn't want to hear
 
06:40:55.310 --> 06:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
marital cases so they found a way to
 
06:40:57.708 --> 06:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
have someone else hear them and then as
 
06:41:00.288 --> 06:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
we rolled the Family Division out on by
 
06:41:03.170 --> 06:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
Statute we began to inherit the superior
 
06:41:05.690 --> 06:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
Court's marital Masters until July 1st
 
06:41:08.208 --> 06:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
2011 as I said there were 13 left we got
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
them all
 
06:41:12.288 --> 06:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
as part of House Bill 609 which was the
 
06:41:14.150 --> 06:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill that created the Circuit Court in
 
06:41:16.850 --> 06:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
2011 uh
 
06:41:19.490 --> 06:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
under speaker O'Brien there was a
 
06:41:22.610 --> 06:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
provision put into 490f that said as a
 
06:41:25.010 --> 06:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
marital Masters term expires and they
 
06:41:26.930 --> 06:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
were they were appointed for five-year
 
06:41:26.940 --> 06:41:27.948 align:start position:0%
were they were appointed for five-year
terms

06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
terms
 
06:41:31.070 --> 06:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
or they retired they couldn't they they
 
06:41:33.048 --> 06:41:33.058 align:start position:0%
would be converted to a Judicial
 
06:41:36.590 --> 06:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
position as the budget allowed there
 
06:41:39.048 --> 06:41:39.058 align:start position:0%
were three marital Masters in that one
 
06:41:41.530 --> 06:41:41.540 align:start position:0%
year that 2011 window
 
06:41:46.128 --> 06:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
whose terms expired David Forrest and
 
06:41:48.288 --> 06:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
barber and Phil cross
 
06:41:50.510 --> 06:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
those three marital Masters were
 
06:41:52.670 --> 06:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
terminated their their positions were
 
06:41:55.010 --> 06:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
ended and Barbara went into the
 
06:41:57.410 --> 06:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
practices of law day Force I think
 
06:41:59.330 --> 06:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
taught at Keen for a while and Phil
 
06:42:01.250 --> 06:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
cross became a mediator
 
06:42:03.350 --> 06:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
the next but the next session of the
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislature we went back and we said can
 
06:42:06.890 --> 06:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
we change that because that seems unfair
 
06:42:10.970 --> 06:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
can we change it to when a judge retires
 
06:42:13.128 --> 06:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
um or is not reappointed that the
 
06:42:15.170 --> 06:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
position would convert and the statute
 
06:42:17.868 --> 06:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
was amended so that marital Masters
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
terms could be extended if they wanted
 
06:42:22.910 --> 06:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
to stay over the course of time marital
 
06:42:25.850 --> 06:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
Mass has retired some then did apply to
 
06:42:28.128 --> 06:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
become judges including judge Garner
 
06:42:31.010 --> 06:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
judge craw Phil cross applied for a
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
Judicial position he's now a judge Dave
 
06:42:36.110 --> 06:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
Forrest is a judge Jen Lemire who I
 
06:42:37.730 --> 06:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
think this committee's heard from on a
 
06:42:40.670 --> 06:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
couple of occasions is a judge Bob Foley
 
06:42:42.470 --> 06:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
was a marital Master he became a judge
 
06:42:44.690 --> 06:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
he's now a retired judge
 
06:42:46.610 --> 06:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
did I miss anyone
 
06:42:50.770 --> 06:42:50.780 align:start position:0%
okay and so Tom Cooper was the last
 
06:42:54.650 --> 06:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
marital Master to retire he retired last
 
06:42:56.690 --> 06:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
year and he is the one mayoral master
 
06:42:59.930 --> 06:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
that still sits very occasionally he's
 
06:43:01.730 --> 06:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
been great to cover for us when we've
 
06:43:03.590 --> 06:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
had a coveted illness or something he's
 
06:43:05.628 --> 06:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
gone in and covered dockets for us but
 
06:43:07.850 --> 06:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
we're we basically have no more marital
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:14.208 --> 06:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
um why so
 
06:43:14.218 --> 06:43:15.350 align:start position:0%
um why so
um

06:43:15.350 --> 06:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:18.650 --> 06:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
with the f um
 
06:43:21.350 --> 06:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
with the efforts of Juvenile Diversion
 
06:43:24.708 --> 06:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
do you see a reduction in uh the time
 
06:43:26.990 --> 06:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
that that circuit court judges are
 
06:43:31.250 --> 06:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
spending on juvenile related cases
 
06:43:33.470 --> 06:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
so judge Ashley's the expert on that
 
06:43:35.330 --> 06:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
she's the deputy administrative judge
 
06:43:37.010 --> 06:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I know only from speaking with her
 
06:43:39.470 --> 06:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
that the number of cases that actually
 
06:43:43.128 --> 06:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
become cases now is has been decreased
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
dramatically because of the requirement
 
06:43:48.410 --> 06:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
to have an evaluation done before the
 
06:43:50.570 --> 06:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
charge can be filed and I think that's
 
06:43:52.548 --> 06:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
made a big difference and I think it's
 
06:43:55.850 --> 06:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
keeping a lot of kids out of court that
 
06:43:57.650 --> 06:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise would find themselves tied up
 
06:43:59.510 --> 06:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the judicial system I think
 
06:44:00.890 --> 06:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's been a I think she would say it's
 
06:44:05.030 --> 06:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:07.010 --> 06:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you could talk generally
 
06:44:10.070 --> 06:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
about the use of guardian ad litem

Guardians Adel item in uh in family law
 
06:44:13.558 --> 06:44:21.110 align:start position:0%
Guardians Adel item in uh in family law
cases

06:44:21.110 --> 06:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:23.830 --> 06:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
before the Circuit Court came into being
 
06:44:26.930 --> 06:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
Guardians ad litem were I think more
 
06:44:30.170 --> 06:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
numerous than they are currently
 
06:44:32.448 --> 06:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
there was a period of time when we had a
 
06:44:34.670 --> 06:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
state fund that would pay some of the
 
06:44:36.590 --> 06:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
fees for Guardians I'd Litem for folks
 
06:44:38.150 --> 06:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
who were eligible for those kinds of
 
06:44:38.160 --> 06:44:39.288 align:start position:0%
who were eligible for those kinds of
services

06:44:39.288 --> 06:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:44:42.048 --> 06:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
part of the creation of the Circuit
 
06:44:45.530 --> 06:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
Court was to emphasize mediation as a
 
06:44:47.810 --> 06:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
way to resolve cases and I think the
 
06:44:50.208 --> 06:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
theory was that if cases were mediated
 
06:44:51.948 --> 06:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
and resolved by agreement between the
 
06:44:53.930 --> 06:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
parties we wouldn't need Guardians I'd
 
06:44:56.208 --> 06:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
like them to the extent that they were
 
06:44:58.910 --> 06:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
sort of the rule of the day in the days
 
06:45:00.708 --> 06:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
when these cases were heard in Superior
 
06:45:03.410 --> 06:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
Court there are still Guardians at Litem
 
06:45:06.590 --> 06:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
who are practicing there are not nearly
 
06:45:08.930 --> 06:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
as many as there were and the state fund
 
06:45:11.150 --> 06:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
that used to pay for their fees for
 
06:45:14.090 --> 06:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
eligible parties is now hasn't been in
 
06:45:16.310 --> 06:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
place for a number of years
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
so they potentially have a role to play
 
06:45:22.910 --> 06:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
as a as a judge who hears a lot of these
 
06:45:25.788 --> 06:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
cases and as someone who did Guardian Ad
 
06:45:27.350 --> 06:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
Litem work when I was in private
 
06:45:29.708 --> 06:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
practice I think there's a role for them
 
06:45:32.090 --> 06:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
they can be very helpful in the right
 
06:45:35.030 --> 06:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
case they are
 
06:45:37.788 --> 06:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
simply because of the finances only now
 
06:45:39.830 --> 06:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
available to folks who can afford to pay
 
06:45:41.090 --> 06:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
for their fees
 
06:45:43.190 --> 06:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
and those fees can be significant
 
06:45:45.890 --> 06:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
particularly Guardians ad litem who were
 
06:45:48.170 --> 06:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
practicing attorneys will they may not
 
06:45:49.970 --> 06:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
charge exactly what they would charge a
 
06:45:51.830 --> 06:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
private client but
 
06:45:54.170 --> 06:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
um they need to charge enough money to
 
06:45:56.448 --> 06:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
make the work attractive to them and
 
06:45:58.490 --> 06:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's what they do so we have Guardians
 
06:46:00.110 --> 06:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
that light them available in Laconia
 
06:46:02.750 --> 06:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
we've got three or four on a list they
 
06:46:04.670 --> 06:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
get some cases but we always have to be
 
06:46:06.288 --> 06:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
very careful with the parties to let
 
06:46:08.750 --> 06:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
them know that the fees are on them and
 
06:46:10.730 --> 06:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
and there's no other way to pay for
 
06:46:14.330 --> 06:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
those Services I could go into
 
06:46:17.750 --> 06:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
endless detail about the role and the
 
06:46:19.968 --> 06:46:19.978 align:start position:0%
history but I think the short answer is
 
06:46:21.530 --> 06:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
that Guardians at Litem are available
 
06:46:24.128 --> 06:46:24.138 align:start position:0%
but only to a certain select few of our
 
06:46:28.868 --> 06:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
why are the members of family law
 
06:46:33.530 --> 06:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee not required to serve a number
 
06:46:36.170 --> 06:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
of hours observing what really happens
 
06:46:39.288 --> 06:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
in court stay tuned we're going on field
 
06:46:39.298 --> 06:46:40.368 align:start position:0%
in court stay tuned we're going on field
trips

06:46:40.368 --> 06:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
trips
 
06:46:44.690 --> 06:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:44.700 --> 06:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:46:45.670 --> 06:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:48.110 --> 06:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
this question I think is
 
06:46:49.548 --> 06:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's probably something
 
06:46:51.830 --> 06:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
that would be important to discuss
 
06:46:54.890 --> 06:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
um can you just whoever would be the
 
06:46:57.650 --> 06:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
most uh the most appropriate one to
 
06:46:58.850 --> 06:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
answer this but can you just talk
 
06:47:02.230 --> 06:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
generally about the effect of delay
 
06:47:06.048 --> 06:47:06.058 align:start position:0%
in in coming to an accurate you know an
 
06:47:07.730 --> 06:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
accurate decision in the case in other
 
06:47:10.430 --> 06:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
words you know we've we're obviously the
 
06:47:12.650 --> 06:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
As Time Goes By memories fade that kind
 
06:47:14.270 --> 06:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
of thing but in the particularly in the
 
06:47:16.368 --> 06:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
family law context
 
06:47:18.350 --> 06:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
um can you can you talk about that a
 
06:47:21.288 --> 06:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
little bit how delay and and uh and
 
06:47:23.090 --> 06:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
having cases adjudicated how that can
 
06:47:27.770 --> 06:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
affect the accuracy of of fact finding
 
06:47:30.530 --> 06:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
you mean delay during the process of
 
06:47:32.390 --> 06:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
getting to the final hearing or delay
 
06:47:34.128 --> 06:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
after the final hearings taken place
 
06:47:36.770 --> 06:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
well I guess both really maybe uh but
 
06:47:39.110 --> 06:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
but probably more more the former than
 
06:47:43.850 --> 06:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
most of our divorce cases are based on
 
06:47:48.590 --> 06:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable differences now there are
 
06:47:50.448 --> 06:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
foregrounds available but they're rarely
 
06:47:53.628 --> 06:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
pled and rarely uh hotly litigated and
 
06:47:56.810 --> 06:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
so the question of delay comes up
 
06:48:00.530 --> 06:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
if there are changes in values for a
 
06:48:02.030 --> 06:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
property that's going to be distributed
 
06:48:04.190 --> 06:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
for example the parties separate and a
 
06:48:05.628 --> 06:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
year later the house is worth something
 
06:48:08.270 --> 06:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
different than it was that can create an
 
06:48:09.948 --> 06:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
issue for parties depending on how the
 
06:48:11.448 --> 06:48:11.458 align:start position:0%
market is doing
 
06:48:15.110 --> 06:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
there is delay affects children
 
06:48:17.810 --> 06:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
in practical ways children whose parents
 
06:48:20.150 --> 06:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
have separated and whose future with
 
06:48:21.590 --> 06:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
either parent may be a little bit
 
06:48:23.868 --> 06:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
uncertain creates anxiety and problems
 
06:48:26.270 --> 06:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
for them behavioral problems for them
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a dramatic impact of of
 
06:48:31.010 --> 06:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
the delay in the process
 
06:48:32.990 --> 06:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
some delay in the process is inherent
 
06:48:34.610 --> 06:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
because the parties still need to
 
06:48:38.090 --> 06:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
reassess what they have and and do their
 
06:48:40.010 --> 06:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
Discovery and be prepared for a final
 
06:48:42.590 --> 06:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and and to look into negotiated
 
06:48:45.770 --> 06:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
settlement but delay in the process is
 
06:48:45.780 --> 06:48:47.208 align:start position:0%
settlement but delay in the process is
almost

06:48:47.208 --> 06:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
almost
 
06:48:50.208 --> 06:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
never a good thing unless something is
 
06:48:51.948 --> 06:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
happening in the meantime to help the
 
06:48:54.890 --> 06:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
parties toward resolution so if a case
 
06:48:56.990 --> 06:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
is going to go out several months
 
06:48:59.150 --> 06:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
without anything being scheduled we'll
 
06:49:00.770 --> 06:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
talk to the parties about using the rest
 
06:49:02.570 --> 06:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
of their mediation time
 
06:49:04.190 --> 06:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
if they haven't used all of their
 
06:49:06.048 --> 06:49:06.058 align:start position:0%
mediation time or we might arrange for a
 
06:49:07.730 --> 06:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation once the
 
06:49:09.770 --> 06:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
discovery is done to give them a handle
 
06:49:13.310 --> 06:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
on what to expect so it is um
 
06:49:16.190 --> 06:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the parties emotionally
 
06:49:19.310 --> 06:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
it can be detrimental to the family and
 
06:49:22.670 --> 06:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
it can may it can make valuation issues
 
06:49:25.310 --> 06:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
taking place months after the moment of
 
06:49:27.890 --> 06:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
separation more difficult for the court
 
06:49:29.690 --> 06:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
but really more the former than the
 
06:49:31.610 --> 06:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
latter we can manage the valuation
 
06:49:34.670 --> 06:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
issues already it's the it's the sort of
 
06:49:37.368 --> 06:49:37.378 align:start position:0%
ongoing anxiety and
 
06:49:40.670 --> 06:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
chronic emotional outfall that we really
 
06:49:43.610 --> 06:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
worry about for folks
 
06:49:45.350 --> 06:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
and I should say that's true after the
 
06:49:47.628 --> 06:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
final hearing has taken place too that's
 
06:49:49.368 --> 06:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
a terrible time for folks to be waiting
 
06:49:52.250 --> 06:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
for their orders and we would always
 
06:49:55.128 --> 06:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
like to get the orders out as soon as
 
06:49:57.230 --> 06:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
possible as soon as we can review the
 
06:49:58.910 --> 06:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
evidence write the order and be
 
06:50:05.048 --> 06:50:05.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.030 --> 06:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if this really addressed to
 
06:50:11.570 --> 06:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
to uh to any of you but um as you I
 
06:50:14.390 --> 06:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
think as you both as you've met some of
 
06:50:16.910 --> 06:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
you have reflected on before
 
06:50:16.920 --> 06:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
you have reflected on before
um

06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:21.350 --> 06:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
the family cases it was my experience
 
06:50:22.730 --> 06:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
when I was in the judicial branch and
 
06:50:25.128 --> 06:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's your family cases are the
 
06:50:28.330 --> 06:50:28.340 align:start position:0%
ones that tend to generate the most
 
06:50:31.670 --> 06:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
complaints to us as legislators to the
 
06:50:34.368 --> 06:50:34.378 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee
 
06:50:36.170 --> 06:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
um you know complaints in the media that
 
06:50:38.510 --> 06:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
kind I wonder if you could and I should
 
06:50:41.090 --> 06:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
say my understanding and correct me if
 
06:50:42.890 --> 06:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
things have changed in the last three
 
06:50:45.170 --> 06:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
and a half years but the overwhelming
 
06:50:47.330 --> 06:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
majority of complaints that are made to
 
06:50:49.670 --> 06:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct Committee in family
 
06:50:51.948 --> 06:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
cases are found to be non-meritorious
 
06:50:53.750 --> 06:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are that's not to say all of them
 
06:50:56.628 --> 06:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
but but the vast majority of them
 
06:50:58.670 --> 06:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
but I wonder if you could offer any
 
06:51:00.948 --> 06:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
insights as to why you think that is
 
06:51:02.990 --> 06:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
06:51:05.150 --> 06:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
family cases in particular tend to
 
06:51:13.090 --> 06:51:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:15.410 --> 06:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'll just talk generically and I'm not
 
06:51:19.490 --> 06:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
the expert on the marital law as judge
 
06:51:21.530 --> 06:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
Garner as if I've been a judge for 33
 
06:51:22.730 --> 06:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
years nobody would want me hearing the
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
divorce case it's outside of my area of
 
06:51:26.990 --> 06:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
expertise but I do review all of the
 
06:51:29.090 --> 06:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
complaints because I get them at the end
 
06:51:30.830 --> 06:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
of the process and I think they're just
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
there as you well know representative
 
06:51:36.770 --> 06:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
Linda High emotion cases people are very
 
06:51:38.750 --> 06:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
set in their ways they feel very
 
06:51:40.968 --> 06:51:40.978 align:start position:0%
strongly about their position for good
 
06:51:43.490 --> 06:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
reasons and when the case doesn't go the
 
06:51:46.430 --> 06:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
way they wanted to then the they're
 
06:51:48.170 --> 06:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
angry at the judge they're angry at the
 
06:51:50.150 --> 06:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
process they file appeals they file
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
complaints and
 
06:51:53.930 --> 06:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
we they want us to make their lives
 
06:51:55.850 --> 06:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
better and that's and we just don't have
 
06:51:57.288 --> 06:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
that ability to put their lives back
 
06:51:59.208 --> 06:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
together that the judges just can't do
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
that and you know as you heard divorce
 
06:52:03.350 --> 06:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
cases in the Superior Court when you
 
06:52:05.448 --> 06:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
were judged I worked with judge
 
06:52:07.490 --> 06:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester this morning we were going
 
06:52:09.350 --> 06:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
over the code of judicial conduct and
 
06:52:11.090 --> 06:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
06:52:12.948 --> 06:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
um disqualification and we're talking
 
06:52:14.930 --> 06:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
about the judicial conduct committee and
 
06:52:16.610 --> 06:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
the Tapley case is the case that we
 
06:52:17.990 --> 06:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
train on and that was your case that
 
06:52:19.430 --> 06:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
went to the Supreme Court and I think
 
06:52:20.868 --> 06:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
you had
 
06:52:23.810 --> 06:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
four if not five JCC complaints filed
 
06:52:26.570 --> 06:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
against you in that case and you stayed
 
06:52:28.190 --> 06:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
with the case because you felt you
 
06:52:29.448 --> 06:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
didn't have a conflict in the Supreme
 
06:52:32.030 --> 06:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
Court affirmed you but you you certainly
 
06:52:34.128 --> 06:52:34.138 align:start position:0%
have a sense for how emotionally
 
06:52:35.990 --> 06:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
draining these cases are and how people
 
06:52:38.208 --> 06:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes file complaints out
 
06:52:40.010 --> 06:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
of out of anger because the case didn't
 
06:52:46.090 --> 06:52:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:49.690 --> 06:52:49.700 align:start position:0%
I gotta read it our judges paid a salary
 
06:52:52.968 --> 06:52:52.978 align:start position:0%
or is there a financial incentive for
 
06:52:55.968 --> 06:52:55.978 align:start position:0%
them to hear more emotions in a case
 
06:52:57.830 --> 06:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I can answer that question I think
 
06:52:59.390 --> 06:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
everyone don't mind Mr chairman I'll go
 
06:53:00.650 --> 06:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
back and just add something to the
 
06:53:03.948 --> 06:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
previous the answer is yes we are paid a
 
06:53:05.628 --> 06:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
salary and no there is no Financial
 
06:53:07.610 --> 06:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
incentive for us to have more motions
 
06:53:07.620 --> 06:53:08.570 align:start position:0%
incentive for us to have more motions
fine

06:53:08.570 --> 06:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
fine
 
06:53:08.580 --> 06:53:10.490 align:start position:0%
fine
ask

06:53:10.490 --> 06:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
ask
 
06:53:13.430 --> 06:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to add that
 
06:53:16.070 --> 06:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think some of the difficulties
 
06:53:16.080 --> 06:53:17.030 align:start position:0%
I think some of the difficulties
um

06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:19.310 --> 06:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
that are inherent with Family Division
 
06:53:22.548 --> 06:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
cases and particularly parenting cases
 
06:53:24.770 --> 06:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
come about because
 
06:53:27.110 --> 06:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
the relationship typically at one time
 
06:53:29.270 --> 06:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
was a good relationship between the
 
06:53:30.650 --> 06:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
parties if they have children or if
 
06:53:32.090 --> 06:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
they've been married for a long time and
 
06:53:32.100 --> 06:53:32.930 align:start position:0%
they've been married for a long time and
now

06:53:32.930 --> 06:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:53:35.208 --> 06:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
something's gone wrong sometimes
 
06:53:37.670 --> 06:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
something terribly wrong so there's a
 
06:53:39.170 --> 06:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
history and there's a sense from the
 
06:53:40.730 --> 06:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
parties that they're looking back and
 
06:53:42.128 --> 06:53:42.138 align:start position:0%
they're asking the court to look back
 
06:53:44.208 --> 06:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of what may have
 
06:53:46.610 --> 06:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
been a very long-term relationship with
 
06:53:49.070 --> 06:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
ups and downs but carrying forward as a
 
06:53:50.510 --> 06:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
team and now they're not a team anymore
 
06:53:53.868 --> 06:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
so there's a real emotional component
 
06:53:56.090 --> 06:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
there there's also the sense I think
 
06:53:57.948 --> 06:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
from litigants who are involved in these
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
cases that their whole world in terms of
 
06:54:02.690 --> 06:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
where they live what they do what they
 
06:54:04.968 --> 06:54:04.978 align:start position:0%
can rely on for finances
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
is being turned upside down and in some
 
06:54:10.250 --> 06:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
ways is being shaken by the process to
 
06:54:13.670 --> 06:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
see what sorts out and
 
06:54:16.190 --> 06:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
finally if it's a contested parenting
 
06:54:17.570 --> 06:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
issue there's nothing that touches
 
06:54:19.250 --> 06:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
people more closely than their
 
06:54:21.048 --> 06:54:21.058 align:start position:0%
relationship with their children
 
06:54:23.448 --> 06:54:23.458 align:start position:0%
and that's at risk and they find
 
06:54:25.310 --> 06:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
themselves in a process that's sort of
 
06:54:27.110 --> 06:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
foreign to them in terms of the
 
06:54:29.270 --> 06:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
terminology and the forms and someone
 
06:54:31.910 --> 06:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
from their point of view is reaching out
 
06:54:34.910 --> 06:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
to change that relationship that they
 
06:54:37.250 --> 06:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
have with their children it's it's not a
 
06:54:40.250 --> 06:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
Wonder to me at all that it's a very
 
06:54:43.310 --> 06:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
intense emotional kind of a process all
 
06:54:45.048 --> 06:54:45.058 align:start position:0%
we can do is try to make it as Fair as
 
06:54:47.510 --> 06:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
we can and and let the parties do as
 
06:54:49.368 --> 06:54:49.378 align:start position:0%
much as they can Empower them to do as
 
06:54:51.170 --> 06:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
much as they can to try to resolve their
 
06:54:53.330 --> 06:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
cases on their own it's their children
 
06:54:55.490 --> 06:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's their lives we really don't want to
 
06:54:57.890 --> 06:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
be rearranging those things if we don't
 
06:54:59.750 --> 06:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
have to and if they can do it so we
 
06:55:01.610 --> 06:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
encourage that but it doesn't make the
 
06:55:03.170 --> 06:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
cases much easier
 
06:55:05.990 --> 06:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
before we listen to the final few
 
06:55:08.930 --> 06:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
questions I want everybody to know that
 
06:55:11.750 --> 06:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
we will be adjourning at 4 30 or in your
 
06:55:15.610 --> 06:55:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:21.650 --> 06:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
no they get us they get a salary I know
 
06:55:26.930 --> 06:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
so um we'll have a few more questions
 
06:55:30.170 --> 06:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
and any of you who may stay please do
 
06:55:33.770 --> 06:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
and we'll hang out and ask you private
 
06:55:33.780 --> 06:55:34.670 align:start position:0%
and we'll hang out and ask you private
questions

06:55:34.670 --> 06:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:55:37.730 --> 06:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
you know uh this question I'm I'm I'm
 
06:55:40.190 --> 06:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
altering it just a little bit to make it
 
06:55:41.570 --> 06:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit broader to capture
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
what I think are is a matter that that
 
06:55:46.368 --> 06:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
I've heard issues on
 
06:55:48.708 --> 06:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
um people raising questions about
 
06:55:52.430 --> 06:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
um can you explain the process for uh by
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
which the uh the record is made uh when
 
06:55:58.190 --> 06:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
when a case is being heard
 
06:56:02.150 --> 06:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh how a party can get a copy of the of
 
06:56:03.650 --> 06:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
the record
 
06:56:05.150 --> 06:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and if there are you know if the
 
06:56:06.830 --> 06:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
party is Indigent are there funds
 
06:56:11.270 --> 06:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
available to to to Aid that process and
 
06:56:14.990 --> 06:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
when if ever is the wreck is a record
 
06:56:20.330 --> 06:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:23.208 --> 06:56:23.218 align:start position:0%
first thing I do when we get new judges
 
06:56:26.030 --> 06:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
is tell them that the record you do not
 
06:56:28.010 --> 06:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
want to do anything that's not on the
 
06:56:30.230 --> 06:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
record the old days when we practice law
 
06:56:32.448 --> 06:56:32.458 align:start position:0%
on Spirit core a lot was done in
 
06:56:34.190 --> 06:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
Chambers law was done off the record
 
06:56:35.868 --> 06:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
deals were made
 
06:56:38.570 --> 06:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
we tell our new judges everything is
 
06:56:41.810 --> 06:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
done in open court on the record our
 
06:56:45.410 --> 06:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
FTR for the record equipment is kind of
 
06:56:47.208 --> 06:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
antiquated some of it's some of the
 
06:56:48.830 --> 06:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
machines that we have in the courts are
 
06:56:50.868 --> 06:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
are older than others some are hooked
 
06:56:53.628 --> 06:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
into our Network we have varying stages
 
06:56:56.270 --> 06:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
of equipment and we're trying to replace
 
06:57:00.350 --> 06:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
it as we have the funds to do that it's
 
06:57:02.390 --> 06:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
the judge's responsibility to make sure
 
06:57:04.190 --> 06:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
that the record is on when there's a
 
06:57:05.330 --> 06:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
hearing going
 
06:57:08.030 --> 06:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
as I said at the outset sometimes the
 
06:57:10.128 --> 06:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
judge him or herself or court security
 
06:57:11.390 --> 06:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
officer someone is actually the one
 
06:57:13.128 --> 06:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
that's turning the machine on we don't
 
06:57:15.288 --> 06:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
have court monitors and we've had
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
certainly cases where everyone thought
 
06:57:19.910 --> 06:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
the record was running and the case is
 
06:57:21.530 --> 06:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
done and someone files as a notice of
 
06:57:23.390 --> 06:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
appeal and they go to retrieve the
 
06:57:24.890 --> 06:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
record and it's not there because it was
 
06:57:27.048 --> 06:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
some kind of a malfunction because we
 
06:57:29.690 --> 06:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
don't have court monitors sitting there
 
06:57:31.670 --> 06:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
making sure the record's you know
 
06:57:34.010 --> 06:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
working all the time that's not a good
 
06:57:35.448 --> 06:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
thing I would love to have court
 
06:57:37.010 --> 06:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
monitors like the superior report does
 
06:57:39.890 --> 06:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
which would pretty much ensure that in
 
06:57:43.250 --> 06:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
every case the record will be done and
 
06:57:47.810 --> 06:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
operating properly anyone can order a
 
06:57:51.830 --> 06:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
copy of the audio from a hearing they do
 
06:57:53.208 --> 06:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
it through the clerk's office as a fee I
 
06:57:55.510 --> 06:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
think it's 25 to get a copy of the CD
 
06:57:57.350 --> 06:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
transcripts are ordered through and out
 
06:57:59.448 --> 06:57:59.458 align:start position:0%
we Outsource those to escribers which is
 
06:58:02.750 --> 06:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
an independent company that we they
 
06:58:04.968 --> 06:58:04.978 align:start position:0%
download the audio to them and they have
 
06:58:06.288 --> 06:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
transcriptionists that type the record
 
06:58:08.990 --> 06:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
in cases where parties are Indigent and
 
06:58:10.670 --> 06:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
qualify for appointed counsel like a
 
06:58:13.070 --> 06:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
public defender situation the state pays
 
06:58:14.990 --> 06:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of the transcripts if it's a
 
06:58:16.610 --> 06:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
civil case and the parties are appealing
 
06:58:18.230 --> 06:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
or just want a copy of the record they
 
06:58:21.650 --> 06:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
pay a per page cost it it goes up
 
06:58:23.570 --> 06:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
depending on how quickly you want the
 
06:58:25.310 --> 06:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
transcript if you want it in seven days
 
06:58:27.650 --> 06:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's so much a page if you can wait 30
 
06:58:30.708 --> 06:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
days it the cost is reduced but there
 
06:58:32.150 --> 06:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
should be a record available
 
06:58:35.090 --> 06:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
for every case in the Circuit Court in
 
06:58:37.070 --> 06:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
Superior Court as well and and hopefully
 
06:58:39.350 --> 06:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
the equipment's functioning properly the
 
06:58:41.330 --> 06:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
judges during the course of a hearing I
 
06:58:42.530 --> 06:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
know you may have heard some testimony
 
06:58:44.930 --> 06:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
during a hearing judge doesn't have a
 
06:58:46.850 --> 06:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
secret lever on the bench that they can
 
06:58:48.708 --> 06:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
turn off and on
 
06:58:50.628 --> 06:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
um secretly turn the record on and off
 
06:58:52.310 --> 06:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
the Record is either on or it's not and
 
06:58:54.288 --> 06:58:54.298 align:start position:0%
you'll if when you go to visit courts
 
06:58:55.730 --> 06:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
and I encourage all of you to do that
 
06:58:58.190 --> 06:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be be happy to host you on the
 
06:59:00.530 --> 06:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
judge's bench you'll see a digital
 
06:59:03.288 --> 06:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
display with a Time on it in Big Red
 
06:59:05.868 --> 06:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
Letters and those numbers are turning
 
06:59:07.968 --> 06:59:07.978 align:start position:0%
that means the records that means the
 
06:59:10.070 --> 06:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
record's on the recording is on
 
06:59:11.930 --> 06:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
and that the record is functioning
 
06:59:14.510 --> 06:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully properly again in the Superior
 
06:59:16.250 --> 06:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
Court you'll see a court monitor sitting
 
06:59:18.250 --> 06:59:18.260 align:start position:0%
in front of the bench with headphones on
 
06:59:21.230 --> 06:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
and they're constantly making sure all
 
06:59:22.610 --> 06:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
the microphones are working and that
 
06:59:24.770 --> 06:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
there's no hiccups with the record we we
 
06:59:26.448 --> 06:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
don't have that we just don't have that
 
06:59:28.310 --> 06:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
luxury and fortunately most of the time
 
06:59:30.650 --> 06:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
the record is okay but as I said from
 
06:59:32.810 --> 06:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
time to time we'll have an appeal filed
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
and there'll be a problem with a record
 
06:59:36.170 --> 06:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
and typically in that case the case has
 
06:59:38.030 --> 06:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
to be retried there's really no other
 
06:59:41.948 --> 06:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
remedy so we don't want that to happen
 
06:59:45.288 --> 06:59:45.298 align:start position:0%
one more question or topic
 
06:59:49.810 --> 06:59:49.820 align:start position:0%
so um this question uh
 
06:59:53.510 --> 06:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
why do judges call suisponty hearings
 
06:59:55.850 --> 06:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
not at the request of either party can
 
06:59:57.650 --> 06:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
you just sort of
 
06:59:59.570 --> 06:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
tell us if that happens with any
 
07:00:08.690 --> 07:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:10.910 --> 07:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
it probably happens from time to time
 
07:00:13.548 --> 07:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
when a case has been sitting for a
 
07:00:15.170 --> 07:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
period of time and something hasn't been
 
07:00:17.930 --> 07:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
scheduled for example if there were a
 
07:00:20.090 --> 07:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
temporary Hearing in temporary orders
 
07:00:22.010 --> 07:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
were entered and there was no order then
 
07:00:23.810 --> 07:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
for a pre-trial conference or for a
 
07:00:25.968 --> 07:00:25.978 align:start position:0%
final hearing whatever it might be and
 
07:00:27.288 --> 07:00:27.298 align:start position:0%
the case is sat for a little while
 
07:00:28.730 --> 07:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
because the court was expecting
 
07:00:30.468 --> 07:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
something to be filed or something had
 
07:00:32.030 --> 07:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
been filed and we were waiting for the
 
07:00:32.040 --> 07:00:32.990 align:start position:0%
been filed and we were waiting for the
objection

07:00:32.990 --> 07:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
objection
 
07:00:35.690 --> 07:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
then the court might the court clerk
 
07:00:37.850 --> 07:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
might bring the case to the judge's
 
07:00:39.530 --> 07:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
attention and say what's going on with
 
07:00:41.930 --> 07:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
this what do we need and then we would
 
07:00:44.750 --> 07:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
typically we'd look at it and typically
 
07:00:46.548 --> 07:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
schedule a status conference or a
 
07:00:48.170 --> 07:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
pre-trial conference if one hasn't
 
07:00:51.288 --> 07:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
happened to keep the case moving
 
07:00:51.298 --> 07:00:51.948 align:start position:0%
happened to keep the case moving
um

07:00:51.948 --> 07:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:54.230 --> 07:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
those are the only circumstances I can
 
07:00:56.030 --> 07:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
think of outside of the emergency
 
07:00:58.850 --> 07:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
category when something is filed as an
 
07:01:00.288 --> 07:01:00.298 align:start position:0%
emergency and something has to happen
 
07:01:01.548 --> 07:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
right away
 
07:01:03.530 --> 07:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
cord is going to schedule a hearing it's
 
07:01:04.850 --> 07:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
either going to be after Services
 
07:01:06.948 --> 07:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
achieved on the other on the other party
 
07:01:09.288 --> 07:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
or if it's a pending case it's going to
 
07:01:10.968 --> 07:01:10.978 align:start position:0%
be within a period of time that the
 
07:01:12.650 --> 07:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
court thinks necessary to let the
 
07:01:15.048 --> 07:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
parties prepare but to get orders out as
 
07:01:17.270 --> 07:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible after a hearing so
 
07:01:19.010 --> 07:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
from time to time the clerks will bring
 
07:01:21.410 --> 07:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
cases to our attention and just ask what
 
07:01:22.910 --> 07:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
should we schedule here nothing's been
 
07:01:24.610 --> 07:01:24.620 align:start position:0%
scheduled and we'll do that
 
07:01:27.350 --> 07:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
so I guess it is suas Ponte but it's
 
07:01:29.270 --> 07:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
really just typically a means of getting
 
07:01:32.570 --> 07:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
the case back on track in the usual case
 
07:01:34.430 --> 07:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
when we do a temporary hearing part of
 
07:01:36.770 --> 07:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
the temporary orders will say Discovery
 
07:01:38.690 --> 07:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
to be complete by this period of time
 
07:01:40.430 --> 07:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
schedule a pre-trial conference after
 
07:01:43.010 --> 07:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
discovery is complete or if the case has
 
07:01:44.810 --> 07:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
limited issues and we can schedule a
 
07:01:46.430 --> 07:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
final hearing with confidence that they
 
07:01:48.110 --> 07:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
need the amount of time being scheduled
 
07:01:50.330 --> 07:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
we'll just schedule a final hearing then
 
07:01:52.730 --> 07:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
that issue is taken care of so it does
 
07:01:54.830 --> 07:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
happen sometimes and and typically it's
 
07:01:57.230 --> 07:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
just the Court's way of nudging the case
 
07:01:59.448 --> 07:01:59.458 align:start position:0%
back onto track
 
07:02:01.750 --> 07:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:02:04.788 --> 07:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to let you bang the gavel
 
07:02:06.590 --> 07:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
because I started
 
07:02:06.600 --> 07:02:07.788 align:start position:0%
because I started
um

07:02:07.788 --> 07:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:10.850 --> 07:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
this concludes our wonderful two-hour
 
07:02:13.670 --> 07:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you and I hope this
 
07:02:15.350 --> 07:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
isn't the last I hope we'll see you
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
again sometime and yeah we'll take you
 
07:02:18.948 --> 07:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
up on we're going to do a road trip or
 
07:02:18.958 --> 07:02:19.670 align:start position:0%
up on we're going to do a road trip or
two

07:02:19.670 --> 07:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:02:22.548 --> 07:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
in 26 years as a judge I never used a
 
07:02:27.850 --> 07:02:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:31.128 --> 07:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
07:02:31.138 --> 07:02:33.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
okay
