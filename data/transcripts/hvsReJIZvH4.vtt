Allegiance thank you raron for coming
 
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
today um we're we're still waiting on a
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
couple of answers to a couple questions
 
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
um but um I'd like to um go right to the
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments that have been drafted um in
 
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
in in the committee testimony we heard
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
that um there has been a lot of issues
 
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 align:start position:0%
with leases um with state agencies and
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions so we wanted to
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
create um a statute that kind of brings
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
it um it brings fairness into it by um
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
using uh fair market rates in uh lease
 
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
renewals so I did draft an amendment um
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
specifying that um and we received um
 
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
another amendment from I'm sorry your
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
name would you like to come up to the
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
table and um just explain what you did
 
00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh members of the
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horan I
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
of counties so uh representative Lon had
 
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
asked us to work on defining what fair
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
market value was um so we played around
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
with that a little bit and what we
 
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
determined is so buildings are appraised
 
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
every 5 years um but you could get an
 
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
appraisal at any time if you know the
 
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
county or the state wanted to pay for it
 
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
to get a more upto-date
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
number um and so what we did was so you
 
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
take that divide it by the square
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
footage of the building and then take
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
out any depreciation that the building
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
has so like if the building doesn't have
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
working electricity and the state's
 
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
going to come in and they're going to
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
have to do an upgrade so that the
 
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
building works that number would be
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
counted for in the determination of fair
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
market value um and then we just added
 
00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 align:start position:0%
in any additional expenses included but
 
00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
not limited to utilities custodial
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
Services things like that should be
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
negotiated separately um we didn't want
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
to make it a very Define list because uh
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
I think I pointed out like 50 years ago
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
no one needed you know fiber optic lines
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
and things like that you know who in
 
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
another 50 years everyone may need a
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
drone landing pad or something like that
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're building um but um that's kind
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
of what we did and as I said um to the
 
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
chairwoman you know no pride of
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
authorship here we just wanted to try
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
and put something in front of you for
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
you guys to work
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
with go
 
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you for taking my question
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
Kate so uh kind of uh to go back to the
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
question about uh depreciation that we
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
were talking about before the meeting uh
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
is that the average loss over time or
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
what what are we talking about when
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that depreciation um I
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
think that's uh counties do depreciation
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
on things all the time
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's usually at that point
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
so you know a building or a piece of
 
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
land may be worth because of where it's
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
located a whole bunch more but at that
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
moment in time if it doesn't have you
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
know functioning electrical or water
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
sewer or something like that then we
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
wanted we were trying to be fair to make
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
it account for any uh deficiencies that
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for testifying today um
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
market value for a property can vary
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically from an appraised value and
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're not even close right
 
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
um the goal is have an apprais value
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
that approximates market value but it
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't always work that way yeah and I
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
will say so that there's no nothing in
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
this language requires them to use this
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
so if they want to negotiate a different
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
rate I think in that line before that
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
unless agreed to upon a different rate
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
this is just an option if you wanted to
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
negotiate by fair market value yeah I I
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
think it's better to just stick with the
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
phrase fair market value and not bring
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
in appraised value because you can get
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
off track like in our town in Milford uh
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
the the average market value uh the
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
appraised value is
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
67% of sure market value uh which which
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
is very low sure and um
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know you you could be way off and
 
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of a typical thing when
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
the prices of properties are changing
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
like they've been skyrocketing lately
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
yeah you know a ratio of 67% is not out
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
of line it used to not be that way you
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
know things didn't change that much and
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
it would be pretty close 90% or or
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
something um yeah we were just trying to
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
find something that would work across
 
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties uh because obviously you
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
know uh property and cost is very
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
different than Rockingham is very
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
different from chesher so but honestly
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
if you guys don't want to use this and
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
leave it at fair market value I think
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with that can can can
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that um market value
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
for a lease of a of a uh a unit can be
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
quite different than the value of the
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
building sure uh you can um lease a unit
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
for $1,000 doll uh and by looking at the
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
value of the building it may it might be
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
$500 worth out $4,000 you know it could
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
be way off from what the market value of
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
leasing that space is right um I did
 
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
hear back from Mr farlin as well he does
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
not know what that chart says on the
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
gross item line he apologizes okay okay
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
okay so rep dargy
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
um are you saying that um in the red
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
there we would take out um the first
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
part of that first sentence and just put
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
additional expenses including but not
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
limited utilities custodial Services
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
Insurance exactly I I would delete that
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
first sentence Al together yeah the
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
sentence and that kind of matches up
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
with um the letter that we received from
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
Mr furland and he he has this list of uh
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
categories related to um a particular
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
lease that they did and the he details
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
the individual things maintenance
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance utilities C
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
custodial Etc right right yeah I would
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
have to agree with you there yeah thank
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%

I'm just wondering if if that would help
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
with um your constituent and his
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
concerns if we were to amend the bill

language okay I'm I'm not sure I know
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
red so we would delete um that first
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
sentence in
 
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.870 align:start position:0%

Horgan then I'm fine with it to make
 
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
Horgan then I'm fine with it to make
whatever

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
change thank you um there's a a
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
difference between the two lists um the
 
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
the actual um 0825 Amendment um in line
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
three three uh talks about space owned
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
by a political subdivision mhm so uh
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
that limits uh this change to just uh
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
things owned by a political subdivision
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
like a county and it's not
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
um a independently owned piece of
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
property um in the the one that's
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
described as cost approach it could just
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
be any lease and it doesn't have to be
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
owned by a thing of the town so I of the
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
state so I like the the the phrase owned
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
by a political
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision to be in there yeah uh what
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is go down to OS and
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
work off my Amendment just adding that
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
last sentence in red and of course
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
changing um the RSA number that you
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
found um and um where it says custodial
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
Services Etc um I would like to take off
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
the the ETC and just put insurance and
 
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.750 align:start position:0%
the the ETC and just put insurance and
maintenance

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
I I want to disagree with that going
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
back to representative or not
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative sorry uh Kate Horgan's
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and the fact that we don't
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily know what some of these new
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
expenses may be uh for instance uh one
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
of one of the examples was
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
Communications uh we didn't need uh
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
internet service uh 50 years ago uh
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
being delivered to the counties but we
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
do now so it is something where we may
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
want to uh kind of give a little bit of
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
leeway on that one we have the wording
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
not limited to
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah you could just take out
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
the ETC I think that would cover it
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
could say additional expenses including
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
but not limited to utilities and
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
custodial at services period okay um no
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
no reason to put insurance and
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance in there no because you're
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
you've got the phrase including but not
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
limited to so all right I don't know if
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
you really if you need to like list them
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
all what makes sense all
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
right good good oh yes R dargie um I
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
have a question do we want to consider
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
making this uh going both ways right now
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
uh it only talks about space owned by a
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
political subdivision right being leased
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
by the state uh what about making it
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
space owned by the state and leas to a
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
political subdivision right how about I
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
um do we add the word
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
between any renewal between any renewal
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
of a lease for land buildings or space
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
between a political subdivision or a
 
00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:18.110 align:start position:0%
between a political subdivision or a
state

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
rate did you repeat that again I did um
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
any renewal of lease for land buildings
 
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.670 align:start position:0%
any renewal of lease for land buildings
or

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
space between a political subdivision
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
and a state agency and a state
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
sense so is there is there any case
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
where property would be owned by the
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
state but not by an agency or is it
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
know would that cover a yeah if if we
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
just said State I think that would also
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
include the state agencies so I think
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
that if we just leave it at state that
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
and so so we don't need this reference
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the RSA if we were getting rid of the
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.389 align:start position:0%
right
okay

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
so the amendment would read any renewal
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
of a lease for land buildings or space
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision and the State of New
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall be renewed at a fair
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
market rate unless otherwise agreed upon
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
lessor additional expenses including but
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
not limited to
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
utilities and custodial Services shall
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
separately that does it sounds good to
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
me that's good yeah sounds great all
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
agree in it yeah okay I'll go draft that
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
at OS okay right now awesome and I will
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
close the public um the sub committee
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
meeting on HB 694 thank you so much for
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
your working on this we really
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for being here
 
00:15:35.720 --> 00:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you for being here
today

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
either of you involved in voting
 
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:18.629 align:start position:0%
either of you involved in voting
tomorrow

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
no yeah that that's that's very
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
strange that that would be the one
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
committee that you would think would
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely not be meeting tomorrow
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
