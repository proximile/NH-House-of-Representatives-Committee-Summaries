00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
think that's uh counties do depreciation

so if they want to negotiate a different

this<00:06:30.800><c> is</c><00:06:31.039><c> just</c><00:06:31.199><c> an</c><00:06:31.520><c> option</c><00:06:32.479><c> if</c><00:06:32.639><c> you</c><00:06:32.759><c> wanted</c><00:06:33.120><c> to</c>

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
this is just an option if you wanted to
 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.469 align:start position:0%
this is just an option if you wanted to

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
negotiate by fair market value yeah I I
 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.309 align:start position:0%
negotiate by fair market value yeah I I
think<00:06:36.599><c> it's</c><00:06:36.759><c> better</c><00:06:37.000><c> to</c><00:06:37.240><c> just</c><00:06:37.720><c> stick</c><00:06:37.960><c> with</c><00:06:38.120><c> the</c>

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
think it's better to just stick with the
 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.350 align:start position:0%
think it's better to just stick with the

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
phrase fair market value and not bring
 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.589 align:start position:0%

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.749 align:start position:0%

00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:18.509 align:start position:0%
know would that cover a yeah if if we
just<00:14:16.880><c> said</c><00:14:17.160><c> State</c><00:14:17.560><c> I</c><00:14:17.639><c> think</c><00:14:17.839><c> that</c><00:14:17.920><c> would</c><00:14:18.120><c> also</c>

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
just said State I think that would also
 

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:21.189 align:start position:0%
just said State I think that would also
include<00:14:18.920><c> the</c><00:14:19.079><c> state</c><00:14:19.440><c> agencies</c><00:14:20.440><c> so</c><00:14:20.800><c> I</c><00:14:20.920><c> think</c>

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
include the state agencies so I think
 

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.710 align:start position:0%
include the state agencies so I think
that<00:14:21.560><c> if</c><00:14:21.639><c> we</c><00:14:21.800><c> just</c><00:14:21.920><c> leave</c><00:14:22.040><c> it</c><00:14:22.160><c> at</c><00:14:22.320><c> state</c><00:14:22.600><c> that</c>

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
that if we just leave it at state that
 

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.550 align:start position:0%
that if we just leave it at state that
would<00:14:22.839><c> be</c>

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:32.670 align:start position:0%
would be
good<00:14:24.560><c> in</c><00:14:24.720><c> the</c><00:14:24.839><c> state</c><00:14:25.040><c> of</c><00:14:25.199><c> New</c><00:14:25.519><c> Hampshire</c><00:14:26.519><c> okay</c>

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:14:32.880><c> so</c><00:14:33.399><c> so</c><00:14:33.560><c> we</c><00:14:33.680><c> don't</c><00:14:33.880><c> need</c><00:14:34.160><c> this</c><00:14:34.920><c> reference</c>

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
and so so we don't need this reference
 

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
and so so we don't need this reference

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
right
 

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.389 align:start position:0%
right
okay

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:50.430 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:14:48.399><c> the</c><00:14:48.560><c> amendment</c><00:14:49.040><c> would</c><00:14:49.199><c> read</c><00:14:49.600><c> any</c><00:14:49.839><c> renewal</c>

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
so the amendment would read any renewal
 

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.030 align:start position:0%
