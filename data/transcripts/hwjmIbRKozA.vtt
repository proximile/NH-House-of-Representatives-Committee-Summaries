Administration thank you just for your
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
own awareness I do have a third director
 
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
of enforcement I'm happy to give you her
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
her name and titled just for your
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
benefit she's not here today might as
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
well while you're doing yes so director
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
of enforcement is Sarah Rogers Sarah
 
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
H D and
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
Rogers no d r o g
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely so just go ahead and start um
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
the mission of the New Hampshire oplc is
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
to safeguard public health safety
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
welfare environment and the public Trust
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of the State of New
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I like to say if the law
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
says it we do it if it doesn't we don't
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
so uh that is my preference that's my
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
mode of operation at any point if we're
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
trying to untangle a situation whether
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's in Ru making procedure operations
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're always going back to the law to
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
see what does it say what do we need to
 
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
do what are we mandated to do um so
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's more mymo it's not very
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a very flashy mission statement
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
but but that is is largely how we're
 
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
pursuing doing our current operations so
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
the office structure here just to give
 
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of a picture sense so
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have the director the division of
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement against Sarah Rogers so that
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
is investigations and prosecutions on
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
that side of the house so complaints
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
come in they're evaluated they're either
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's a can be a recommendation for
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
dismissal we can talk more about that
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement process on a future slide
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
but there's investigations and
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutions two separate pieces of that
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
division licensing and board
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
Administration again under the direction
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
of Bethany Katrell that has board
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
Administration the office has 57 boards
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
that it currently provides
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
administrative support to seven of those
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
are advisory and 50 of them are what we
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
would just describe as a full licensing
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
board just for the sake of the
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
distinction um that division has uh
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
board administrators so we have a a team
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
that support each of them support
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
several boards but our assigned to them
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
are at every board meeting manag ing the
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
agenda coordinating with the chair um
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
technology different pieces basically
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
that service to the boards um licensing
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
which is individ and customer service
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
are in that as well so that is the folks
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
answering our phones um and then issuing
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
credentials responding to emails I have
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
a few more details on a future slide
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
about that as well and the third piece
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
over there is compliance
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
so um that is inspections now in the PLC
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
400s so
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology facilities are inspected
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
pharmacies um and then other pieces so
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
where there's a compliance component
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily enforcement it's
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
just ensuring that they're complying
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
with the the statutory and the
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory mandates so those are all
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
live in that division that is our
 
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.869 align:start position:0%
live in that division that is our
largest

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
largest
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
division um the third is operations so
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
that is Heather Kelly that includes
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
Human Resources Finance Information
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
Technology contracts project management
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
and anything else that I
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
need on currently and Under the Umbrella
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
kind of of the executive director's
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
office is general counsel and board
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
counsel so those are so that would be
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
attorney fry and then I also have an
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
attorney Elizabeth Baker who provide
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
agency counsel and then there are three
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
positions that are um designated as
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
board councel they're assigned
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to boards they're in every
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
board meeting advising the boards
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
providing them legal support during
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
their meeting
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
and then the hearings Bureau also
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
reporting up to the executive director
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have two administrative law judges
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
this um before the reclassification from
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
dop would have been um a hearings
 
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
officer basically a presiding officer um
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
for adjudicative and Licensing
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings um and then one hearings
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
clerk that facilitates the
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
administration of that I will pause
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
there it's a big a big umbrella overview
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
but if you have any other questions I
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
will get into more details but how many
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh hearings off officers
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
two and then one clerk so just the three
 
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:40.670 align:start position:0%
two and then one clerk so just the three
down

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
there so what's the total uh number of
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
Staff in your in the um oplc now I'm
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
going to look at Heather it as you
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
understand that it's fluctuating
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
regularly just with hirings and
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
departures and changing over there do we
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
have a head so authorized is 120 I think
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the next slide I will uh not bore
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
you with reading every single border
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
profession that we thank you very much
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
that we regulate but just for your own
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
situational awareness and if you're
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
wondering does that live it OPC or
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else this will provide you an
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list of what is here I will
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
just make a quick note um out of Al
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order at the very end I
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
just I have douas lactation consultants
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
and Community Health worker those are
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
new voluntary certifications that we're
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
currently engaged in rule making on um
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
we're engaged in that process right
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
now would you mind indicating the ones
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.949 align:start position:0%
that are
advisory

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
yes was going through the list assessing
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
certification is advisory
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going in alphabetical start from the
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
top certification
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
yes yes there's seven there are seven
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:23.710 align:start position:0%
 
reporters

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
massage

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
therapists medic Medical Imaging and
 
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.470 align:start position:0%
therapists medic Medical Imaging and
radiation

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
technology Imaging and radio yep about a
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
third down the second column there we're
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
six medical technicians medical
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
technicians is not presently an Advisory
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
therapy seven all right actually Medical
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
technicians aren't exactly a board
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're just a profession right there is
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
currently no there's not presently a
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
board that is correct thank you yes and
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
then um around that same thing opthamol
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
dispensing professionals is also just a
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
credential there is no Associated board
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
profession

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to the next
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
this is pulled directly from the statute
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
but I figured just for a a broad picture
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
I would go over the Executive Director
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for RSA
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
3104 so responsible for supervision of
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
division directors um currently has
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
Chief legal officer and Chief of Staff
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
those positions the legislature was um
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
included in a bill last session those
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
positions have not been posted or filled
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh due to uh current budgetary
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
constraints so those those are vac
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
funding um you said chief of staff and
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
which Chief legal officer thank
 
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
you so again employment of personnel
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
needed to carry out functions of the
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
office and the
 
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
boards examination processing and
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
approval of denial of an application for
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
lure certification or registration for
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
all license
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
types so the the Nuance there is the
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
boards the licensing boards they will
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
determine the objective standards for
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
the lure so the professionals that are
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
assigned to these boards are developing
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
the criteria and the office is the one
 
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's basically doing the processing
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
and the evaluation if there is a
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
question about whether a leny has met
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
the qualifications whether it's
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
something very technical or related to
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
the profession then staff are sending
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
those to the board for review for their
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
expertise so if there is a question
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
we're not guessing we we're Consulting
 
00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:01.389 align:start position:0%
we're not guessing we we're Consulting
the

00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
board um letter D is the investigation
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
of all complaints of professional
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
misconduct so again the office is
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for that investigation those
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
reports of Investigation go to the board
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
and then adjudication or a dismissal
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
that action is taken by the board from
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
there maintenance of the official record
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the office and Boards in accordance
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
with the retention policy so that's just
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
the all the the record holders are not
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
held by the boards it's held just by the
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
office um so any compliance with um 91a
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
records requests are processed by The
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
General Counsel office not by individual
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
boards um letter F Drafting and
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
coordinating rul making for all boards
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
within the office with advice and
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the boards so in that
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
case that is the same across every board
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
whether advisory or a licensing board is
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
that we're getting advice and
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations now if it's a the full
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
licensing board they have their own
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
chapter so um optometrist is one that I
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
was reviewing yesterday so that's
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
Optometry rules and they have their set
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
if it's an Advisory Board it would be
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
part of the PLC so the office chapter
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
related to that profession but again in
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
consultation with those advisory boards
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
who are the technical experts in that
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
regard and then yeah so letter G I
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
already alluded to maintaining
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of information documents
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
and files in accordance with 91a
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
the the last one in that statute I left
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
off because it just says I have to
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
produce an annual report and I didn't
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that was particularly relevant for
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
there wanted you quickly so those are
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director kind of the
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
office responsibilities and I wanted to
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
go over the board
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I touched a little bit
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
on board versus Advisory board so the
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
rule making is the first piece
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
here um just to give you a general
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
outline of how are laid out the 100s
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
would be organizational rules
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
definitions um kind of just general
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
grounds um table setting if you will a
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
criteria for initial lure would be
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
established in the
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
300s criteria for Renewal would be in
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
the 400s as well as continuing ed
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
requirements ethical standards would be
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the 500s generally and then there's
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
other regulation scope of practice you
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
know Pharmacy goes up up to 2600 they
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
have pretty extensive rules so anything
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
after 500 is miscellaneous at the
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
determination of the board and the
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
office in the drafting there but if
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're if you're looking for
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
organizational rules initial or renewal
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking at one three and 400s for
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
any given profession or the PLC rules
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
which would control the process for
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
those things so just to give you a
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of a
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
framework the disciplinary process again
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
for boards they make the final
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
determination on whether to investigate
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
a complaint or dismiss
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
it that
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
determination can happen at two at two
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
points so the office under goes an in a
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
facial review of a
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
complaint if they determ that it is not
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
determine that it's not legally
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
viable there will be a dismissal memo
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
drafted and sent to the board and say we
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
recommend that you dismiss this
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
complaint the board does not have to
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
dismiss it they could say nah you really
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
got to look at this again send it back
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
up for investigation so that's the first
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
the facial review we say dismiss it the
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
board says go take a closer look send
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
comes back up to enforcement that
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
determination could also be made if the
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
office says we think there might be
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
something here Pro produces a report of
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
Investigation at the end of that make a
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation to move forward they
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
could say either dismiss or move forward
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
so then the board would make a decision
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
there so those are kind of two parallel
 
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
tracks pending that facial review yes um
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
I've had some some uh concerns from
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
lenses that at that point you should be
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
complainant that the board accepts or
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
rejects the uh complaint is that your
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
common practice that is that is the
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
common practice I I have been hearing of
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
instances where that has not occurred so
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're tightening up that process in
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
policies to ensure that is happening
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
because that is the goal is to notify
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
them when a matter is closed they know
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
it is over yes yeah or even thank you
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
for your complaint we've decided it
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
merits investigation and we'll be
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
working on it m i mean either way the
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
the problem is when someone makes a
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
complaint and it you know
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
radioes yes I I will add we did
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
Institute a reply um just when a
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
complaint is um when it is filed just
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
even just confirming receipt of the
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
complaint and saying thank thank you for
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know for filing this here are the
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
two either it will go this way out you
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
know that it'll have this review it will
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
either go to the board so basically kind
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
of laying out what I just laid out for
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
you here are the next steps you will
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
hear from us in these instances so I'm
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
hoping that provides some clarity that
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
isn't a new within the last month new
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
kind of just communication out to
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
complainants thank you that solves one
 
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.750 align:start position:0%
complainants thank you that solves one
concern

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I will keep going pending
 
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
yeah I will keep going pending
questions

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
um so they um they make the final
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
determination on whether to dismiss
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue a confidential letter of concern
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
or commence with a disciplinary
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
proceeding so similar piece there they
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
are the fact finders in disciplinary
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings so if we are in an
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearing the board sits as
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
the finders of fact they work uh
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
frequently with board counsel to produce
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
those findings of
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
fact um for the presiding officer uh to
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
impose sanctions in disciplinary
 
00:19:57.919 --> 00:19:59.549 align:start position:0%
impose sanctions in disciplinary
proceedings

00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
approve or deny settlement agreements in
 
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.669 align:start position:0%
approve or deny settlement agreements in
disciplinary

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
proceedings they decide motions to
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
dismiss that are based on fact in law
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
with the presiding
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
officer they can emergently suspend a
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
lenses license with the presiding
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
officer and they can delegate any of
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
their disciplinary proceeding
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the presiding
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
officer so um one instance there's a an
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
Emergency process which I'm happy to
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
talk through probably I would have
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
attorney fry talk through it he has a a
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
really good understanding of that
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
because distill for you um but one
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
example would be 3:00 on a Friday
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon we receive a complaint that we
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
would consider emergent that action
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken expeditiously we don't
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
want this person to be able to work to
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
practice through the weekend because of
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
whatever alleged violation uh those are
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
quite minimal it's it's not a regular
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
occurrence but they do happen um to
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
convene a board in the last hour or even
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know we could work late but on a
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon would be quite
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
challenging so we do now have the
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity where if something comes
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
down to hearings and we need that we can
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
work with the board chair we can try to
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
get a quorum if we cannot get a quorum
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
available for that they can delicate
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
that decision to the presiding officer
 
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to move forward um in that
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
case so that's what is covered in that
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
point I've never heard the adverb ently
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
does that mean on an emergency basis or
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
in case of an emergency yes is that what
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
that wow that's quite a word thank
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
educational I will all right I'll keep
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
going the next slide for licensing as I
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned already the board is
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for determining the criteria
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
for lure under statutory scheme as
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
permitted by law
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
um consult with the executive director
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
on criteria for licensure by endorsement
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity under 310 so that is the um
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different words that
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
are used somewhat interchangeably but
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
the the license your reciprocity that's
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
the portability if you're licensed in
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
another state that piece there the word
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
endorsement is used for clarity I think
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney but I think when you
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
say reciprocal it implies it goes both
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
ways we obviously can't tell other
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
states what they have to do so it is by
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
definition we cannot say it has to go
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
both ways we'll accept you and you
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
accept us um that's more of a compact
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
model but again that's a different
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism so licensing by endorsement is
 
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.029 align:start position:0%
mechanism so licensing by endorsement is
the

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of um HP 594 from 2023
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
that would say that portability between
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
states making recommendations to the
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
office on how to proceed with processing
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
and application so again that was if
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
there is a question uh criminal
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
background check comes back and we need
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
um some consultation there there's
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
pieces um included in that and then act
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
as a FactFinder in licensing hearings
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
upon request of the office
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the board request of
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
the applicant or upon board decision so
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of variables
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
there if you get too technical I'll kick
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
it over to attorney fry
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
but again would you mind walking us
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
through the process my daughter
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
graduates as a nurse okay what she does
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
her Clinic
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
who examines her who says uh she's
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
qualified do you send the papers who
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
keeps track of her hours uh how does
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
that actually happen can you mind
 
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.230 align:start position:0%
that actually happen can you mind
walking

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
through Mary scitech nurse um if you
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
don't mind i' I'd love to have Bethany
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
catrell come up and answer that just at
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
some point if that's appropriate now or
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
when she's going to get to
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
it I think that was be appropriate now
 
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
it I think that was be appropriate now
okay

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay good morning Bethany Katrell
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
division director of Licensing and board
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
Administration nice to see you all um so
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
every uh license type is a little bit
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
different in their processes but nursing
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
for example if um I graduate from my
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
nursing program say I go to St a I
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
finished my clinical hours all of that
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
has been documented through the school
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
and then once I graduate I apply to oplc
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
um to take my exam what we call it is a
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
ATT they apply to take their test um as
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
a new nursing grad I then get approval
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
from oplc to sit for that exam and we
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
let the exam company know um and that go
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
ahead the the bo oplc administers the
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
exam or the we uh nope we have a third
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
party that administers the exam that we
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
have on contract with okay sorry we're
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
lucky that we're all very collaborative
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
so we're very thankful to be able to
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
work together um during that time the ly
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
has like a provisional um license where
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're able to work under certain
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions which you wish correct and
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
then uh we get the results back from
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
their exam they have to have their also
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
their FBI criminal background check done
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
and then once we get get all of that
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
together then they get their full
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
unrestricted license which you would you
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
deliver that you send the paper we uh
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
email them but yes they receive that
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
from us you get an email certificate
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
yes wow it's not nearly as dramatic as
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
it used to be right it saves a lot of
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
money in postage so we're much more
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible when you have
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
lenses I do um want make a comment about
 
00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
that so last year
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we did was we
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
gave the office the authority to issue
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
the licenses and an online system was
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
put together so that what was typically
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
happening and correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
was that somebody would send an
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
application in by mail it would be
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
missing a document so the office would
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
have to mail it back to the person with
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
all their packet have this thing added
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
mailed back and it was this going back
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
and forth that was causing an issue and
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
so now the way the system is is imple it
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
implements itself is that someone
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
applies through the portal and unless
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
they've attached all those documents
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
properly they can't go to the next step
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
so there isn't this regurgitation of
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
male going back and forth and I think
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
this has from what I understand and from
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
speaking for the people who have who um
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
have requested licenses the process
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
is uh is flows better yeah and I will
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
say um excitedly that yesterday we run
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
our numbers uh bi-weekly and so
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was looking at our bi-weekly
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
reports for new applications and
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
statutorily we have 90 days to make a
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
decision on our applications um that in
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
the past because of this back and forth
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
that representative grto was talking
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
about um often has gone beyond that uh
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday when I looked 87% of our
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
applications were were a decision was
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
made within uh the 90day time frame and
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
57% were within 14 days so Within 14
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
days 57% of our applications were
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
approved and out the door which is huge
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
especially compared to other states why
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be 10 minutes not 90 days
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
once the third party sends back that
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
they passed the test and submitted their
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
credentials so in the nursing situation
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
the initial application is that first
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
part where they say okay I've graduated
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
and can I take the test and so then we
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
have to approve them they have to take
 
00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:54.919 align:start position:0%
the approve them to test they have to
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
take the test so there's there's pieces
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
in there that that do delay that um
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
Engineers for example have up to two
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
years to take their exam so that could
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
delay the initial application to when it
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
actually gets approved some of those are
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
the outliers um but we are within uh two
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
weeks most of our applications are being
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
approved and out the door why does
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
anyone need approval to take the test
 
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.029 align:start position:0%
anyone need approval to take the test
that's

00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
long why does anyone need approval to
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
take take a test uh if that's not the
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
final step in their licensing process
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
because you could always deny the
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
license on some other basis if there's
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
some other reason they're not
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
eligible it's an interesting policy
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
question I it really it changes not even
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
just board by board profession by
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
profession so some have statutory
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have to be
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
approved to sit for the test some boards
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
have made that decision in rule that
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
they that they would have to approve
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
members to take the test we could get I
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
don't have off the top of my head the
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
number of boards that have that
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirement but there are there are more
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
than one that would say you they they
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
control who can sit for the exam before
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
application you don't you don't make
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
that you don't make the decision who can
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
sit for the board the boards do right
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
the board set those rules or the statute
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh and then we Pro or deny based on that
 
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.509 align:start position:0%
uh and then we Pro or deny based on that
correct

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
yep yes if you want to do some statutory
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
cleanup on this issue I'm sure it be
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
well rep this goes back to my point if
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
the law says it we do it if it doesn't
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
we don't if you change the law and says
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
you cannot approve anyone anyone can
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
take the test that's what we will do
 
00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:51.789 align:start position:0%
take the test that's what we will do
yeah

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
Bethany so then then just the last piece
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
here kind of our miscellaneous catchall
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
is um issuing declaratory rulings on its
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
rules or on the statutory scheme so
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes a question comes
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
up somebody petitions the board and says
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
what what do I do in this scenario what
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
would happen the board can issue a
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling to give Clarity on
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
that piece of it and then standing
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
orders related to its statutory
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
Authority so a board can issue a
 
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
standing order to say every single time
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
this happens I want X to happen please
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
don't ask me and have an hour convers
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
happens yes saying a criminal record
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
check that only has one Wii doesn't need
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
to be considered by the board for
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
example yes and we do um specific to
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks we are working on
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
we have it established for several
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
boards we'd like to have it across all
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
boards that require that criminal
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
history check that there is some
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
standardization where it says where the
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
board agrees here are the instances
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
where we don't need to see it just issue
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
the credential 100% of the time we're
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to say yes you don't have to bring
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
it to us or here's the ones that we
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
still need to see so we're working on
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
implementing that across all of them
 
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
we're partway there on that piece of it
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that came up representative
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
McGuire we were talking with the lak
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
board specifically there were some
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
challenges there so I think that that
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
has quieted down and we'd like to do
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
that across across everything um just
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
touching on a few more licensing and
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
customer service numbers so in 2024 we
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
had 212 12 plus that number is always
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
fluctuating active
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
lenes um our population has grown so my
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
20% of the state is not quite accurate
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
because we're up over 1.4 million dollar
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
um not dollars people now in population
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
but a large percentage of the state has
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
a credential from the office to work um
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
and that's constantly it's constantly on
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
my mind a a conversation I'm having
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
regularly with staff is that we need to
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
continue to be efficient effective not
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
do more than we need to do
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
um And Timely resolution of these
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
concerns because this is people's
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
livelihood it's it's their ability to
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
work and so that that is top of mind for
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
me at all times um
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
profession so if I
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
take let's just take I take 2500 people
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
which is in the begin in the middle of
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
20 of 2,000 and
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
3000 and If I multiply how how long I
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
guess I'm saying that if we take let's
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
just say we take 50 weeks okay that's um
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
50 I don't I don't let me just do it the
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
top of my I can't do it off the top of
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
my head so 5050 time 2500 is
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
125,000 people so how can we
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
have and and a license is two years
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
right so does
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
that so we're saying that we're turning
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're turning it over every two years
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
and that requires 2,000 to 3,000 people
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
a week so that's that's a really rough
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
estimate some weeks it's under a th000
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
some weeks it's 8,000 uh if it's
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
renewals so there it is extremely
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
variable these expiration dates are the
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's from the date of issuance so this
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
just to give you a general sense of the
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
amount of licenses that they're
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
processing somewhere 2 to 3,000
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a lot higher sometimes
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's a lot lower but this is just to
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
give a General a general gauge of of how
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
many they're processing week in and week
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
out follow up follow up because one of
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
the um things that we did change was
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
that rather than every two years on an
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
anniversary date which was causing this
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
big clog of Licensing was that we would
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
do it would be doing it would be done on
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
the date of
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
issuance so do you think that I'm sure
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
that change over is still in process
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm wondering I think that
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
change over is probably still in process
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
and and there are some I will say so
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
nursing is a good example of this all
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
nurses graduate from school at the same
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
time they all sit for their test at the
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
same time right or at two or three times
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
in the year so you have very busy
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
renewal periods just based on the school
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
calendar so it's not that they're
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
required to be issued on a certain date
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
by anything except for most of them are
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
taking their exams in May so there's a
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
large there there are still those large
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
Seasons there just for the situational
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
Awareness on them one less thank you so
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps what it might what might
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
be interesting to us is the number of
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
lenses you we have 212 lenses so maybe
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
we pick you know
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
what do will the 8020 rule apply do 80%
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
of our lenses fall under a certain
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
number of specific boards you don't have
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
to answer that question now but it would
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
be interesting to know M the uh the
 
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:54.790 align:start position:0%
be interesting to know M the uh the
annual

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
annual
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
report um we've I've only seen the 20
 
00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:58.710 align:start position:0%
report um we've I've only seen the 20
through

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
report oh I apologize I do think I sent
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
it to you I will I will send it to the
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee please yes we'd like to see
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
that has a report of how many licenses
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
per board yeah so I we I know so not for
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this presentation but I I
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
know exactly the number of lenses for
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
every single board and and as director
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
katell mentioned I we I could send you a
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
report of every two weeks the exact
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
number of credentials we issue I don't
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
think you want that but we do have those
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
numbers we do want the uh the annual
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
liing yep happy to do that repres Howard
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
oh representative Schmid thank you madam
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
chair so I I I appreciate the the value
 
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.510 align:start position:0%
chair so I I I appreciate the the value
of

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
standardization uh in in many
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
instances what works for board X can
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
work equally well for board y board y uh
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
but are we do do we know that a standard
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
license uh period is is appropriate
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
for all boards all professions and so
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
forth are we are we looking at what
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
other states do to see whether uh we are
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
evolving as as the board uh as oplc
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
evolves I mean uh some of us were here
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
before the oplc was I'm one of them uh
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
and and it's gone through a lot of uh
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
twists and turns with executive
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
directors who were relatively shortterm
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
and candidly uh not all that effective
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh it sounds to me like like oplc
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
has get gotten kind of through the
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
Shakedown uh period of uh
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
of discovering that this doesn't work
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
that well and no let's do it this way
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
and give it a try or whatever so I think
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're into a more intermediate stage of
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
development uh but are we let's get into
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
my individual question so are we looking
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
at what other states do with regard to
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
duration of
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
licenses um I have not personally looked
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
into that I will say well you've only
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
been in the position for relatively
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
short period of time you're you're in
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
your Shakedown period to some degree as
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
well getting to know what what you're
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
doing and how EXC me representative
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
Schmidt the duration of the license in
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
all cases is specified in statute we are
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
the ones who should be looking into what
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
other states are doing should we wish to
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
make a change well I I I it take the
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
chair's a correction uh for the value
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
that it has uh but the thing
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
is some of us are brand new some of us
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
are quite old and have been in this
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
position for a long time so to the
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
degree that we don't have the kind of
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
global experience that that a board or
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
an organization such as oplc would have
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
because they attend conferences they
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
interact with all kinds of other states
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
in many respects so I think it's what
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
they what they learn
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
from working with other boards in other
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
states is something that they should
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
refer to us for statutory changes I
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
totally get that but that's that's the
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
direction I'm going with my question I
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
haven't noticed any hesitancy on the
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
part of the boards to request statutory
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
changes when they want them so I mean
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
they I think three or four boards have
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
have come to me this year for statutory
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
changes that's interesting I'm glad to
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
hear that but the point is we have
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
whole half of our committee is brand new
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
to the legislative process as well as to
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
this this committee so so I'm exploring
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
things which I think the new members can
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
benefit from discussing or hearing
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
raised by more experienced members of
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
the committee and so forth but also from
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
the director uh so if you don't mind I
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have an answer to my
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
question I would just add so again if
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
the lot says it we do it if it doesn't
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
we don't uh the two-year license period
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
is extremely helpful to us operationally
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
because we're on a banial budget and so
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
it makes Revenue much easier to predict
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're much more accurate in those
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
predictions what because we know every
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
two years this is ex not exactly right
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many people will get a
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
license but it's much easier to predict
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
within that two-year window so for the
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
process of budgeting Revenue estimates
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
is again we if you said nope three years
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
we would make it work but it
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
operationally we really do actually like
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
the two years what other states are
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
doing uh their their funding sources
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
might obviously um be significantly
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
different than ours as well so for the
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
current process that we have now where
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's you know uh all agency funds it's
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
set by fee it's very helpful to us so I
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
just anecdotally say that we we would
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not request that you change
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
you anyone else all right thank you okay
 
00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:27.870 align:start position:0%
you anyone else all right thank you okay
um

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
I I'm really excited to um just
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
highlight our customer service team so
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
between licensing and customer service
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
we have about 35 Staff members um that
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
their their full-time job is answering
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
the phone answering email issuing
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
license credentials they do an excellent
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
job um we're answering between 95 and
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
99% of calls presented and 100% of daily
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
emails um Monday was a abnormally high
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
but on Monday the office in the seven
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
and a half hours that well the eight
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
hours were open fielded 350
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
calls uh it is it is in the thousands
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
every week it it is quite extensive um
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
so we have a large team that is doing
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
that um and uh director Kell highlighted
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
this piece of the um the licenses so
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
more than 80% we're issued within 30
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
days and that's I put the dates in
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
specifically because between 1228 and
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
110 would be holidays lots of people on
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
vacation we have a lot of renewals so
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
even over this holiday period more than
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
80% of them were out within a month so
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just um I'm really excited about
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
that um kind of going back to a little
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
bit about what representative Schmidt
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
was talking about the office has
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
undergone a lot of changes um and with
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
that so with Law changes comes rule
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
changes comes policy changes um we're
 
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
still building a lot of those processes
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
out the focus certainly was we need to
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
get licenses out the door and we need to
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
answer the phone and so that side of the
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
house the Licensing Division um has
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of work a lot of procedural
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
pieces there
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and you can you can see by the
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
Numbers we have the the data from this
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
time last year to now as a dramatic
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
Improvement and and I'm really happy to
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
be able to share with you um that leads
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
me to my next slide to say that the
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of the house is next
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
and that's the plan for 2025 is to
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
really iron out those processes uh to
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that our data is good that
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
there's a timely review of complaints
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the investigations are thorough but
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
they're expeditious and so to give you a
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
little bit of a sense here um the
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
division is currently auditing all
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
pending complaints to verify the status
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
so there were a number of factors here
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
um there was there were some data issues
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
like physical in the the system that
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
need to be verified there's fields that
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
are incorrect and so now we're looking
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
into every single indiv individual
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
complaint to to ensure that that data is
 
00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
accurate um and to verify this is indeed
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
a complaint all of this is accurate the
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
other piece that they're working on is
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
the review for legal viability so that
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
the facial review I talked about at the
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
beginning where a complaint comes in and
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's initially reviewed was not
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
completed for complaints that dated back
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
that were in the backlog when that law
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
went into effect and so what we're
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do is go back and do that
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
review as well to say do do we have some
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
more that we can recommend dismissal for
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
here and then chip away at the backlog
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
so um they're currently working I have
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
messages in my phone right now from the
 
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
division director who says that we're
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
we're even further Expediting that
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
process the goal is to be done within
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
the next three weeks of all to verify
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
all of the complaints to have that data
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
be clean and then to start working
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
through that
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
backlog um so you can see the numbers
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
here we have 271 verified and say almost
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
exactly 10% of the
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
2771 unverified pending complaints so
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's a large number um I am
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
undeterred we're uh we need to make sure
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
that the data is good I don't want to
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
send investigators out on something I
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that it is a verified
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
complaint before we start doing that
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
work um we're working to streamline
 
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
processes collaborate with boards I
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
think um with all of the changes that
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
happened with the office one of the
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
things I think is there there sometimes
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
was a perceived division between the
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
work of the boards and the work of the
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
office and I just don't see it that way
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
um in conversations I'm having with the
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
board I say look we all have the same
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
legislature passing our laws right we we
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
we have the same statute and we have the
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
same boss we all work in the executive
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
branch especially even for myself and
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
board members we all have the same
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
appointing authority we all work for the
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
same people we're doing the same thing
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
and so I'm trying to if there was a Gap
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
close it and even if it's perceived
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
close that perceived Gap to say we're
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
all moving in the same direction we all
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
want to ensure public health and safety
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
we want this to move as efficient as
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
efficiently as possible and we want to
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
we want to protect the public um and so
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
that looks like this improved
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
communication with them collabor ating
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
seeing okay we're sending you dismissal
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
memos and you're just not agreeing and
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
you're sending everything back up what
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
do we need to change and they're saying
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
we need more details you can't just say
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
dismiss it we know right we give us some
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
more specifics tell you know um just a
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
few more words on a page so a memo
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
instead of a half or three qus of a page
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little over a page the board can
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
able they but they have enough
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
information that they feel like they can
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
make an educated decision and that
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
they're they're um they're not afraid
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
they're missing something so that's one
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
that we're instituting we're we're
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
collaborating in that way now we can't
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
always talk specifics of a case because
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
they have to sit as FactFinder in
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
adjudication but just to speak generally
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
what what can we do how can we work
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
together to move this forward and uh and
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm excited about the progress I I do
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
think we're we're moving in the right
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
direction um I monthly call a monthly
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
call with all the board chairs I'm
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
hoping to increase that attendance I
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
don't um you know we have 57 boards I I
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
might have 10 at any time that would be
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
a higher week and so I I'd like to
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
facilitate more of that conversation I
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
do think the ones who attend find it
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
profitable and so just trying to make
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
sure that we're open and we're moving
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
forward in that way I'm happy to talk a
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more enforcement and my
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
director is not here and like I said
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
that this is the one right I I want to
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
be able to come and give you the
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
licensing slide but for enforcement at
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
this time next year
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
so lay um thank you madam chair um thank
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
you for being here we spent some time
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
together last year here with um a with a
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
bill that dealt with the medical the
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine and review um pretty
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
much what you're speaking about right
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
now we walked away from that interim
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
study bill saying that you guys were
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to work together in order to find
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
a process um I was curious if that's one
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the ones that's moving along smoother
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
or because there were some big issues
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
that led to that discussion is that
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
something that's still a work in
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
progress I would say that all of our
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement is a is a work in progress
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
um but I I think the the collaboration
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
between the boards so that the potential
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
wedge that I was saying that perceived
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
wedge I I do think is removing I'm I'm
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
in their board every month when they're
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
there um we're we're in communication I
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
think we're we're getting ourselves on
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
the same page to all move in the same
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
direction so there there is not
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
animosity I do um so I think it's
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
there's no quantifiable way for me to
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
say that except for that the the
 
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
relationship is much better the
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
collaboration is better and I we are all
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward in a good direction so I
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm optimistic about specifically
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:42.069 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
um uh I wanted to touch a little bit on
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
rule making I know that this is the
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
policy committing it's it uh it is not
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
the joint committee on legislative
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh I won't even name the acronym you
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
know what Jil car is um oplc was
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for over 25% of the initial
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
proposals in the rle making register in
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
2024 I like to highlight that because um
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
I I'm very supportive of all my
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch Partners but I I have
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
one full-time and two part-time people
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
doing rules in this office and we do 25%
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
of the state's Ru making so I'm I'm very
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
proud of that we we do need some
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
additional resources there's a lot of Ru
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
making to do but we are getting it done
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
um with the limited staff so I have I
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
have three not even three full-time
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
people doing 25% of the state's rules
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
just because each board has its own
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
Practice Act there's a lot of rule
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
changes that are happening regularly so
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
I like to highlight the work that
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
they're doing um and if any of you are
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
on jail car get ready you'll be hanging
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
out with us a lot you expect 25% in 2025
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
also Pro
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
probably yeah because uh see bullet
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
point to um we're still working with
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
boards to update rules in light of HB
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
655 and then 1095 that statutory cleanup
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
um there's um yes so I think there's
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
still going to be quite a bit of rle
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
making um I wanted to just touch on so
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 31016 includes a new mandate for we
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
making specific to military service
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
members so right now we're working with
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
individual boards um we have contacts at
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
the department of military Affairs and
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
veteran services and so we are um we're
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
working on that that is going to involve
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
a lot more rule making that's a pretty
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
comprehensive project I have one staff
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
member who is the lead on that who was
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
coordin ating organizing um scheduling
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
time with boards specifically to discuss
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
this outside of any other rule making
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
that they're doing or other business um
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
there is some winning of hearts and
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
Minds because it is a little bit of a
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
shift it's not traditional education um
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
but we're very committed to it and um
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
excited to see progress on that in this
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
year so you will see I think across
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
several boards you will see rule making
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um the last piece
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
here is um I'll just touch really
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
lightly on budget and fees again I know
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is a policy committee and that is
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
why I have director Kelly here if you
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
have specific in theed questions you
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't want me to answer them therapist
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
by training so um we're now responsible
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
for fee setting for all Associated
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
professions um so we have a fee package
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we're working on the proposal it's
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
going to accompany our next banial
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
budget uh we are awaiting Direction on
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
what that budget will be and then the
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
fees will be set accordingly to the the
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
cost there and this will this be in the
 
00:50:33.559 --> 00:50:34.870 align:start position:0%
cost there and this will this be in the
governor's

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
budget the our budget will be in the
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
governor's budget the fees are just set
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
in rule it's the PLC 102s and that will
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
be a jail car proposal but we're we're
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
not putting the cart before the horse to
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
say hey give us our fee Revenue before
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
they've set our budgets well you know
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
the the the idea is is that the uh
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
budget is set according to the
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
fees at least that's what the state does
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
so yes so we we also yes all right thank
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
they will be in tandem that is certainly
 
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:15.870 align:start position:0%
they will be in tandem that is certainly
true

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
yep any general
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
questions specific questions
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
anyone representa so I'm concerned about
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
the enforcement frankly because um that
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
is the piece that I think is difficult
 
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.670 align:start position:0%
is the piece that I think is difficult
to

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
tackle and um so I'm just wondering
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
if when you said that you would have a a
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
better idea in a
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
year I'm sorry not a better idea what my
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
hope is to have the met the success
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
metrics that I'm able to present to you
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
for licensing and customer service these
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
are good percentages the time like we're
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
efficient we're getting things out on
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
time what I'm saying is that took some
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
time right it was a year of ironing out
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
processes making progress forward so my
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
my hope is within a year to have that
 
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.069 align:start position:0%
my hope is within a year to have that
success

00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
story we're always improving but that
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
success story so not that in a year I'm
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
going to know what's happening but in a
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
year I can say here's the number of
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
cases that we got through here's the
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing here's the H the
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
time in which we're processing cases and
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be a much better
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
story than I have presently well so how
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
would we know that happened in a
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
year I'm I'm assuming I will be talking
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
to you again at at some point or uh
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
happy to have a special meeting I mean
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'll probably see you every week for the
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
next six months right yes okay that's
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
great so in a year we'll and and it
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in my annual report
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
which I will send to you now in my 2025
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
annual report hopefully would have that
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
as well representative Schmid thank you
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair so we have a new governor uh
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we have heard on
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the past was that that
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
I have heard in any case uh from uh
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
people who have experienced it uh that
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
some boards have um members who are well
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
beyond their uh cell by date so to speak
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
and they're above beyond their statutory
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
limit in terms of how long they've been
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
on the board U and I've heard complaints
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
about people who uh need need to be
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
replaced um and we not replaced by the
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
previous governor so we that's why note
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a new governor but
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
she's going to need to know um from you
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
about uh complaints or uh a situation
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
where people are on the board for too
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
long and where they the their term has
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
been exceeded and they're still there
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
because they haven't been replaced when
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
they should be so is that something
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
you're that you're specifically aware of
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
and looking into and so
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
forth I think this committee will recall
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm personally very vested in that um
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
as it was my responsibility in the
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
previous governor's office for several
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
years to be looking at those vacancies
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
across the entire State um so we're very
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
aware of that I I don't know what this
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
um what governor aot's preference is
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to be for um receiving that
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
information but we we have uh all in one
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
place the roster of all board members we
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
know at any time um any vacancies any
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
members who are in hold over we're
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
regularly communicating with board
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
members as well to see if they are
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
eligible for reappointment and
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
interested that they're personally
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
keeping them like themselves in in the
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
mix shall we say um so we are keeping
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
tabs on that and um and at any point can
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
and and do communicate that there are
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
these vacancies and uh again as a person
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
who looked at boards and commissions
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
full-time for a long time um keenly
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
aware of that uh I think it is a tale
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
that is not unique to any state many
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
Governors um get doing lots of things
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
and boards and commissions are not the
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
most exciting piece of U of any
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch so but I will keep it
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
at the Forefront because it does it
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
impact we have about 350 volunteers that
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
come through every month in this office
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
so there's there's no other agency
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's looking at that right the board
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
members there's a lot of board members
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
so um we're definitely aware of that and
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
and like to keep that up to date as you
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
know our process says it goes through
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
GNC uh and and uh and it is it is a a
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
real drudge to try to keep on top of
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
that situation because it there are so
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
many people involved um and uh and so
 
00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:47.039 align:start position:0%
finding people uh but we also I served
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
on another committee 20 years ago before
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
coming to this committee and we had a
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
situation where the where the committee
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
chair went to the then governor
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh not Governor sonunu a long time ago
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
um and said we don't
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
want such and such a commissioner to be
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
reappointed the our committee the
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
previous committee it was was uh not
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
satisfied with that commission and and
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
our chair went to the governor and said
 
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
do not re reappoint this person so uh
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
that that's a pretty drastic step for a
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
committee to take but but we do hear
 
00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
things because we're the eyes and ears
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
of our citizens but also of the
 
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
executive branch in many respects um and
 
00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.230 align:start position:0%
executive branch in many respects um and
so

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh we will want to know that uh that you
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
are receptive to input from our side as
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
well always happy to hear from any of
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you and there are four of us
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
on the committee you you
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
indicated if any of us are there are
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
four of us own the jail car the three
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
ladies we talk with them regular myself
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
the last session we had
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
a a notice in the house calendar saying
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
we're looking for public members of Bo
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the boards did that provide enough
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
success that we should repeat
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
it I didn't hear of any who applied
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
because they saw it it doesn't mean that
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
they didn't but that was not stated as a
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
reason that they were interested so I
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
don't we'll wait a while then I can't
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
say it not to but I don't I don't know
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
how much it yielded yeah I think we'll
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
wait a while and then it'll be new again
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
when we put it in I do appreciate your
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
support in that yeah all right does
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%

give a little bit of history and context
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
just so you know where this lure tier
 
03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
came from and also uh in the mix of
 
03:04:29.110 --> 03:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
alphabet soup what this is and what this
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
is not so about four years ago Senator
 
03:04:37.150 --> 03:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
Bradley and new Futures were looking at
 
03:04:40.389 --> 03:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
the challenge that we were and are
 
03:04:43.389 --> 03:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
facing around people who are in
 
03:04:45.630 --> 03:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
emergency departments awaiting
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospitalization looking at
 
03:04:50.429 --> 03:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
what some of the barriers to Services
 
03:04:53.429 --> 03:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
were what they found one of the things
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
that they found was that the adults who
 
03:04:58.830 --> 03:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
were awaiting psychiatric
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
hospitalization the majority of them are
 
03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:01.830 align:start position:0%
hospitalization the majority of them are
on

03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:05:04.830 --> 03:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid when looking at the children
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
who are awaiting psychiatric
 
03:05:10.510 --> 03:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalization the majority of them are
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
on their parents' private insurance and
 
03:05:15.990 --> 03:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is important because our community
 
03:05:19.229 --> 03:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
mental health centers have a Medicaid
 
03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
waiver which means that the services
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
provided by anyone regardless of lure
 
03:05:32.030 --> 03:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
whether they have their masters or their
 
03:05:35.790 --> 03:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
doctorate every service gets covered by
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid however for private
 
03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
insurance which the majority of these
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
children are
 
03:05:48.110 --> 03:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
on private insurance requires that for a
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
service to be reimbursed that the person
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
who is providing the service hold a
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
license so the
 
03:06:01.510 --> 03:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
solution three and a half years ago was
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
to create two additional licensure
 
03:06:08.990 --> 03:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
tiers one of them was the licensed
 
03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
social worker that's a bachelor somebody
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
who has graduated from an
 
03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
accredited Bachelor's in social work
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
program we are not talking about that
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
license the other license was the
 
03:06:27.630 --> 03:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
licensed Social Work associate
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
lswa this is somebody who has their
 
03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
associates degree or their bachelor's
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
degree in something other than Social
 
03:06:38.190 --> 03:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
Work might be Human Services might be
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
psychology could be a number of
 
03:06:44.429 --> 03:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
things in providing the
 
03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
in having these two additional lure
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
tiers that would allow for agencies to
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill for these Services provided by
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
people who do not have a master's or a
 
03:06:59.399 --> 03:07:03.750 align:start position:0%
people who do not have a master's or a
doctoral

03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:07.309 --> 03:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
degree the
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh what we are looking to have one of
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
the requirements for the licensed Social
 
03:07:17.550 --> 03:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
Work associate in statute right now is
 
03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
that they sit for the bachelor's social
 
03:07:20.040 --> 03:07:21.190 align:start position:0%
that they sit for the bachelor's social
work

03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:07:25.710 --> 03:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
exam that is uh put forward by aswb
 
03:07:27.550 --> 03:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
which is the Association of Social Work
 
03:07:30.190 --> 03:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
boards we are looking to have that
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
removed as we believe it is a barrier to
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
people being able to actually access
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
tier the reasons why we are asking for
 
03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
the exam requirement to be removed is
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
that we believe it's it's not necessary
 
03:07:49.469 --> 03:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
the these these people a lot of them are
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
case managers Family Support Specialists
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
are already providing these
 
03:07:58.870 --> 03:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
services without a
 
03:08:02.750 --> 03:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
license it is also expensive and we
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
don't want for one more we don't need
 
03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
for one more uh Financial barrier to
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
stand in the way of somebody um getting
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
their lswa their licensed Social Work
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
Associates um
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
not only to take the ex exam test
 
03:08:24.990 --> 03:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
preparation if they don't pass the exam
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
retaking the
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
exam I will say
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does not remove the exam
 
03:08:36.269 --> 03:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
requirement for any other license your
 
03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
tier it is just for the licensed Social
 
03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:41.710 align:start position:0%

03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
plans those things are can only be done
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
by somebody who has their license

about case managers Family Support

oftentimes in in people's homes or in
 
03:10:06.269 --> 03:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
the community thank you representative
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
groa and then representative sellers
 
03:10:11.469 --> 03:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I just want to make sure
 
03:10:13.870 --> 03:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
that I understand up until three and a
 
03:10:17.950 --> 03:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
half years ago when this
 
03:10:21.070 --> 03:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
requirement was put in
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
place it was a way for people who had
 
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
who were um LS
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
swas to be licensed so that the agency
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
could build for their work correct right
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that you want
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
them to continue to have this license
 
03:10:45.750 --> 03:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
and no test
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
correct so how do
 
03:10:51.550 --> 03:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
we what's the point of the license then
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
the point of the license is so that the
 
03:10:59.389 --> 03:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
agency can Bill third-party Insurance it
 
03:11:01.309 --> 03:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
is also a step on the professional
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
development ladder follow up follow but
 
03:11:06.429 --> 03:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement I mean you're
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
saying that they can get a license but
 
03:11:10.750 --> 03:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
the requirement is that they have a
 
03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
bachelor's in something oh no there I I
 
03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
apologize there are other requirements
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they have have they need to have a
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
supervision agreement in place they need
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
two years of
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
supervision be before they can get their
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
license if they have their bachelor's
 
03:11:32.349 --> 03:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
three years of supervision if they have
 
03:11:32.359 --> 03:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
three years of supervision if they have
their

03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
their
Associates

03:11:35.590 --> 03:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
Associates
 
03:11:39.150 --> 03:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
um and yes they they have there are
 
03:11:42.150 --> 03:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
other requirements beyond the exam we're
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
just looking to have the exam removed as
 
03:11:47.070 --> 03:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements because we think
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's a real barrier followup follow
 
03:11:52.830 --> 03:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
up so this test this is is it a national
 
03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
test yes it is
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh aswb the Association of Social Work
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%

workers thank you representative Sellers
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%

03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair uh my
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:12:25.990 --> 03:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
um these uh workers at this point
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
without the requirement for the license
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
do you see them working at the our
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
school systems and our school districts
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
as part of the Seal program that they
 
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
have in places now social emotional
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
learning with the thank you for the
 
03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
not I have not heard of anybody looking
 
03:12:52.830 --> 03:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
to get their social work associate
 
03:12:56.389 --> 03:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
license to do that work because it would
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
be about
 
03:13:01.630 --> 03:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
billing private insurance and usually
 
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
schools do not Bill private insurance as
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
know I I guess I'm I'm unsure whether or
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
not somebody
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
would would do that I'd H I'd have to
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
think more about whether or not that is
 
03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
is a possibility for them okay
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative re thank you madam chair
 
03:13:25.630 --> 03:13:25.640 align:start position:0%
this may not be a fair question so uh
 
03:13:27.790 --> 03:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
please feel free to say so but is the
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
impediment the cost of the test or is is
 
03:13:33.150 --> 03:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
the impediment the passage rate of the
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
test it's both uh
 
03:13:42.269 --> 03:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
the the cost is it's $230 to sit for the
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
exam if you do not pass it it's another
 
03:13:49.349 --> 03:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
$230 and people's spend
 
03:13:52.550 --> 03:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds hundreds on test preparation
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
materials books flashcards
 
03:13:59.870 --> 03:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
classes uh the pass rate
 
03:14:03.910 --> 03:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
for the bachelor's level exam is
 
03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
70% first time and that is for people
 
03:14:12.469 --> 03:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
who have their bachelor's in social
 
03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
work that's not people who don't have
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
their degree in social work
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
work Madam chair would you um the how
 
03:14:24.670 --> 03:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
about the what would be the passage rate
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
the first time around for people who do
 
03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
not have their bachelor's in social work
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know that because those
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
are the people who we're talking about
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
here right right if the passage rate say
 
03:14:39.309 --> 03:14:39.319 align:start position:0%
for example were 30% I'm making up a
 
03:14:41.950 --> 03:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
number competent I do I do not know what
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
the pass rate for people who do not have
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
their bachelor's in social work would be
 
03:14:49.630 --> 03:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
my assumption is it would be
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
considerably lower okay thank you so
 
03:14:56.190 --> 03:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
much yes thank you repres Leo um thank
 
03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
the question uh so is the role of this
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
position basically clerical and setting
 
03:15:05.429 --> 03:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
them up with Services when somebody else
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
is making the care decisions or are they
 
03:15:09.309 --> 03:15:09.319 align:start position:0%
actually using some of those skills that
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:20.269 --> 03:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.309 --> 03:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
it is possible that
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
there I will say it is likely that there
 
03:15:30.309 --> 03:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
are things on the exam that would be
 
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
pieces of knowledge that the person
 
03:15:35.070 --> 03:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
who's doing this work should
 
03:15:35.080 --> 03:15:37.389 align:start position:0%
who's doing this work should
have

03:15:37.389 --> 03:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:15:41.349 --> 03:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh and skills that they are
 
03:15:45.150 --> 03:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
using one of the but I think that is
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
covered in the supervision
 
03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
covered in the supervision
and

03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:53.150 --> 03:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
also uh one of the other requirements is
 
03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:53.950 align:start position:0%
also uh one of the other requirements is
a

03:15:53.950 --> 03:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:15:57.229 --> 03:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
30-hour um prescribed training that
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
covers all the social work competencies
 
03:16:01.710 --> 03:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
in between the time that they have their
 
03:16:04.950 --> 03:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
supervision agreement on file with oplc
 
03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
and getting fully licensed so not only
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
are they going through this this 30-hour
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
training over the course of two or three
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
years but they're also getting the
 
03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
on-site training and supervision at the
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center or other
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
organization that they're working
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
for follow um and thank you and with
 
03:16:25.950 --> 03:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
that supervised training is that just a
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
receptive training or do they need to
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
test and show their competency in it as
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
a part of that training program they do
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
not need there is no test um with that
 
03:16:40.990 --> 03:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
30-hour training I think the showing and
 
03:16:45.630 --> 03:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
meeting competencies is happening within
 
03:16:47.950 --> 03:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
their workplace where they are where
 
03:16:52.510 --> 03:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
they are already doing the work and uh
 
03:16:57.309 --> 03:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
and discussed with supervisors and um
 
03:17:00.510 --> 03:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues okay more follow yeah um
 
03:17:02.910 --> 03:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um then this is my last
 
03:17:05.710 --> 03:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
followup you said that normally it would
 
03:17:08.110 --> 03:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
be more of the administrative clerical
 
03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
but they would sometimes from well yeah
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
that from time to time they would need
 
03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
those skills how confident are you that
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
in that training when they're supervised
 
03:17:17.790 --> 03:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
and in the train TR course they'll have
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
enough exposure to those more critical
 
03:17:22.510 --> 03:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
parts that are covered in the test um
 
03:17:24.910 --> 03:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
just by because you know that you know
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
the number of hours you spend in a chair
 
03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't always correlate or following
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
behind somebody doesn't always correlate
 
03:17:32.469 --> 03:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
to the depth of what you've
 
03:17:36.189 --> 03:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
learned thank you for the question and I
 
03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
would I'm not sure that a standardized
 
03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:45.189 align:start position:0%
would I'm not sure that a standardized
test

03:17:45.189 --> 03:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
test
 
03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
is always the best measure of what
 
03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's competency and ability is um
 
03:17:56.110 --> 03:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
what it might mean is that you're good
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
at taking standardized tests um
 
03:18:03.750 --> 03:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
I I trust in the
 
03:18:08.429 --> 03:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
supervision process and uh and the
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
experience that that these case managers
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
and family support workers and and other
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
non-masters and doctoral level workers
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I also want to emphasize that I
 
03:18:29.309 --> 03:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
am a strong believer in consumer
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
protections I am
 
03:18:37.070 --> 03:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
a i fiercely want to protect uh anybody
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
who who uh any client any patient who
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
comes in in contact with with social
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
workers it's a top priority if I thought
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
that there was any chance that this put
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
the public in danger I would not be
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
sitting here we would not have asked for
 
03:18:57.550 --> 03:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
this bill to be brought forward thank
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
you other questions pres
 
03:19:05.229 --> 03:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
long so if I understood you right uh
 
03:19:07.110 --> 03:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid was able to pay to get this
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
work done uh even without a lure process
 
03:19:14.830 --> 03:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh so what do they do or what do other
 
03:19:17.070 --> 03:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
states that don't have this do to to
 
03:19:20.429 --> 03:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
ensure quality standards are met in this
 
03:19:24.630 --> 03:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.030 --> 03:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
work thank you for the question I the
 
03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
the reason why Medicaid will cover these
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
services for the Community Mental Health
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
Centers is because the Community Mental
 
03:19:39.870 --> 03:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
Health Centers have a Medicaid waiver
 
03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
other organizations and agencies do not
 
03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a Medicaid waiver um they're either
 
03:19:49.990 --> 03:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
absorbing the cost or the cost is being
 
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh passed along to the client or the
 
03:19:52.880 --> 03:19:54.110 align:start position:0%
uh passed along to the client or the
client's

03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
client's
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
patience uh when you look at other
 
03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
states that do have similar lure tiers
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
for people who have their Associates or
 
03:20:03.439 --> 03:20:04.429 align:start position:0%
for people who have their Associates or
their

03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:20:04.439 --> 03:20:09.950 align:start position:0%
their
Bachelors

03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:13.790 --> 03:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh I think we have a more rigorous
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
process in that requirement of the 30
 
03:20:16.319 --> 03:20:17.229 align:start position:0%
process in that requirement of the 30
hour

03:20:17.229 --> 03:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
hour
 
03:20:18.990 --> 03:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
of of prescribed
 
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
training um but those other states like
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts like Maine are able to
 
03:20:29.189 --> 03:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill for the they are able to build
 
03:20:33.070 --> 03:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
private insurance and Medicaid for those
 
03:20:37.510 --> 03:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
services does that answer your question
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
followup sort of but I guess I would
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
assume that when Medicaid issues a
 
03:20:46.349 --> 03:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
waiver there's still some process they
 
03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
go through there or some demand they
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
make uh to ensure that a quality service
 
03:20:54.670 --> 03:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
is still being provided so what were
 
03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
their standards or what are their
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
standards for providing the waiver for
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
equivalent work to be done that's beyond
 
03:21:07.630 --> 03:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
my knowledge um I know that the uh the
 
03:21:10.110 --> 03:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
people who providing this direct service
 
03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:11.309 align:start position:0%
people who providing this direct service
are

03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
supervised things are sign somebody else
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
has to take a look at what's going on
 
03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
and sign off on it okay BR Zone sellers
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to make sure
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
I heard that clear so this person would
 
03:21:28.229 --> 03:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
always be working under a licensed
 
03:21:30.510 --> 03:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
person correct
 
03:21:33.309 --> 03:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
okay yet they cannot work
 
03:21:33.319 --> 03:21:35.150 align:start position:0%
okay yet they cannot work
independently

03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
independently
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
okay representative Pearson thank you
 
03:21:38.279 --> 03:21:40.870 align:start position:0%
okay representative Pearson thank you
madam

03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.750 --> 03:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
chair early on you you mentioned um
 
03:21:48.269 --> 03:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
something that occurred in the senate in
 
03:21:50.670 --> 03:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
a duration how long is how long has this
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for the question
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
I'm you don't have to give me like exact
 
03:22:02.830 --> 03:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
dat is this something that's been less
 
03:22:04.750 --> 03:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
than five years more than five years 25
 
03:22:07.110 --> 03:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
years what what are we looking at here
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.790 --> 03:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
in 2006
 
03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
so and
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
for longer than that so for so for the
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
for the Masters and the clinical
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
level uh the aswb exam has been around
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
for decades decades and this is the exam
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
you want to do away with the exam I want
 
03:22:39.389 --> 03:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
to do away with is the bachelor's level
 
03:22:41.309 --> 03:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
exam for the license Social Work
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
associate that's the only licenser
 
03:22:45.309 --> 03:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talking about how long
 
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
has that exist how long has that a
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
requirement New Hampshire to to since uh
 
03:22:52.630 --> 03:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
the bill came forward three and a half
 
03:22:55.790 --> 03:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
years ago and the lswa was created
 
03:22:56.990 --> 03:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking for three years
 
03:23:00.269 --> 03:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
this has existed okay but but the test
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
itself has been EX in existence longer
 
03:23:04.429 --> 03:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
for decades it's just that we are
 
03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
expanding the number of people we're
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
requiring to take it correct and I will
 
03:23:11.550 --> 03:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
say even though the bill passed three
 
03:23:14.429 --> 03:23:14.439 align:start position:0%
and a half years ago people have only
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
been able to get their LS their licensed
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
Social Work associate for six months
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
there was a whole Ru making
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
process to date we have
 
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
one lswa in New
 
03:23:32.670 --> 03:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that appears to be very
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
small number yep it is okay thank you
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
that's interesting any other questions
 
03:23:44.670 --> 03:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
representative re thank you if this were
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
to pass um how does this speed up or
 
03:23:51.150 --> 03:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
enhance access to me what is the impact
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
how does it enhance access to mental
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
health care for children who are
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
awaiting care does it speed it up by a
 
03:24:00.630 --> 03:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
day a week what is the outcome thank you
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the question I don't believe it
 
03:24:05.309 --> 03:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
speeds up the process for people being
 
03:24:09.870 --> 03:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
able to get Services one bit what it
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
does potentially speed up is the ability
 
03:24:15.870 --> 03:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
for the agencies and organizations to
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
get re re ured for their
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
services we we are not changing the
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
number of people who are doing the work
 
03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
we're changing the amount of work then
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed you yes thank you others
 
03:24:32.640 --> 03:24:33.670 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed you yes thank you others
represent

03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
broa thank you
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
the we put this in so that people could
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed but the
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
but it was at that time the
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
exam at the time
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to get the license was it it
 
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
is in statute that they sit for the exam
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
right so they can hand the licensure if
 
03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
they sit for the exam and that was the
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill that was introduced three and a
 
03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
half years ago yes and I believe the
 
03:25:15.150 --> 03:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
rules were just finalized is that
 
03:25:18.110 --> 03:25:18.120 align:start position:0%

Association of Social Work boards is

strongly opposed to House Bill 271 FN
 
03:26:26.510 --> 03:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
the aswb licensing exams play a
 
03:26:28.670 --> 03:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
critical uh and crucial role in
 
03:26:30.630 --> 03:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
advancing safe competent and ethical
 
03:26:32.309 --> 03:26:32.319 align:start position:0%

03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
social work as a
 
03:26:40.030 --> 03:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
profession this legislation which seeks
 
03:26:42.510 --> 03:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the licensing examination
 
03:26:44.830 --> 03:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
requirement for licensed social worker
 
03:26:46.469 --> 03:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
Associates threatens to undermine mind
 
03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
both Public Safety Professional
 
03:26:51.189 --> 03:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
accountability and the overall Integrity
 
03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
of the social work
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
profession a couple of is little
 
03:26:59.309 --> 03:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
something for to clarify who a aswb is
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
aswb is a nonprofit regulatory
 
03:27:04.510 --> 03:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
organization formed over 40 years ago to
 
03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
assist States in fulfilling their public
 
03:27:09.630 --> 03:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
protection mandates aswb is the
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization composed of

Social Work regulatory boards and and

colleges for all 50 states the District
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
of Colombia and uh some other uh
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
countries besides the United States aswb
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
is the only nonprofit organization
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated to Social Work regulation
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
their mission is to provide support and
 
03:27:32.830 --> 03:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
services to the Social Work regulatory
 
03:27:34.590 --> 03:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
Community to advance safe competent
 
03:27:38.910 --> 03:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
ethical practices to strengthen public
 
03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:41.309 align:start position:0%
ethical practices to strengthen public
protection

03:27:41.309 --> 03:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
um this bill pertains to RSA 330 capital
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
a colon 18 small C which became law in
 
03:27:53.150 --> 03:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
2021 and uh as we have learned this this
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon rule making was promulgated
 
03:27:57.229 --> 03:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
and completed just 6 months ago
 
03:27:59.950 --> 03:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
certainly this was a broad a bold step
 
03:28:01.389 --> 03:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the legislature and the
 
03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
governor to respond to uh what was going
 
03:28:06.830 --> 03:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
on uh in the behavioral health the
 
03:28:08.790 --> 03:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
social uh excuse me the behavioral
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
health and the mental health Realms
 
03:28:13.389 --> 03:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
after 2020 and 2021 it was to increase
 
03:28:16.189 --> 03:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
capacity to address the concerns that
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
that uh many people really needed this
 
03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
care and there didn't seem to be enough
 
03:28:24.750 --> 03:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh Workforce to respond to it in 2024 as
 
03:28:27.189 --> 03:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
well um the interstate social work
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
licensure compact became law with a
 
03:28:31.790 --> 03:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
promise it would help build capacity as
 
03:28:33.790 --> 03:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
well if I'm not mistaken it came out of
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
this committee last year and was signed
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
into law in July of
 
03:28:42.429 --> 03:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
2024 on behalf of the aswb we really
 
03:28:44.110 --> 03:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's too early to determine the
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
impact of RSA 330a 18c and the comp and
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
the compact uh and making a significant
 
03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
change to lure at this point is really
 
03:28:57.030 --> 03:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
premature I will share with you there is
 
03:29:00.750 --> 03:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
Broad support for licensing exams within
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
the social work profession a
 
03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking survey conducted by the
 
03:29:07.030 --> 03:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Work boards
 
03:29:09.269 --> 03:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
reveals an overwhelming endorsement for
 
03:29:12.670 --> 03:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
preserving Social Work licensing exams
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers 78% agree that new
 
03:29:18.030 --> 03:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
social social workers should pass the
 
03:29:23.229 --> 03:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
exam for lure 78% 73% believe removing
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
the exam would be a
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
mistake 76% see the exam as essential to
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
upholding the Professional Standards of
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
social work we certainly believe that
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
licens share is a public safety
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
imperative license share is a
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of public protection and
 
03:29:43.269 --> 03:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
Social Work ensuring that practitioners
 
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
meet rigorous standards of education
 
03:29:47.070 --> 03:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
training and competence
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
we also believe that lure enhances
 
03:29:52.590 --> 03:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
professional Integrity it upholds
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
professionalism it facilitates
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
Interstate Mobility so more people can
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
be served and it certainly does support
 
03:30:02.950 --> 03:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement one of the most important
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
things to aswb certainly is considering
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences this bill
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
may have though it may seem like a
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
simple fix to a problem a barrier to uh
 
03:30:16.030 --> 03:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
this um designation we think the
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences though are
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
really grave we really don't know
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what they are it's a change it's
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
a significant change in policy to
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
facilitate a reimbursement correction
 
03:30:30.429 --> 03:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
and we think that's a little too bold at
 
03:30:33.309 --> 03:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
this time particularly given that the
 
03:30:36.269 --> 03:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
the new law 330 really hasn't been en
 
03:30:38.189 --> 03:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
forced for very long at
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
all consequences of HB 271 would extend
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh to clients who rely on licensed
 
03:30:46.510 --> 03:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
social workers for essential Services I
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
would ask you to remember and I'm sure
 
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
that you already know and I know this is
 
03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
shared by a social workers Association
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
these are some of the most fragile
 
03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
people at risk people that our social
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
workers are dealing with right now we
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
certainly believe that this exam really
 
03:31:05.950 --> 03:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
has to do with practice it's not
 
03:31:08.349 --> 03:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily clerical as uh and I
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question representative
 
03:31:12.349 --> 03:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
Lon this is really will impact the
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
clinical skills exhibited by our social
 
03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
workers so I'm happy to take any
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
questions uh and wrap up my testimony
 
03:31:21.550 --> 03:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
right now thank you very much for your
 
03:31:23.830 --> 03:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
time thank you are there questions
 
03:31:23.840 --> 03:31:25.389 align:start position:0%
time thank you are there questions
representative

03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:31:29.550 --> 03:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
lung so if this is work that is getting
 
03:31:31.710 --> 03:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
done in other context such as a Medicaid
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
waver or potentially just not getting
 
03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed uh even when there is no
 
03:31:41.189 --> 03:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
licensing what Public Safety problems is
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
it creating there uh and how does
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
changing the exam requirement for
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
licensing prevent those
 
03:31:51.429 --> 03:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
problems thank you for your question
 
03:31:53.070 --> 03:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know if it's
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily I can speak to the problems
 
03:31:57.309 --> 03:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
it's creating right now what I will say
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
is a standardized exam testing the
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
competency of people who are dealing
 
03:32:04.389 --> 03:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
with our most
 
03:32:07.630 --> 03:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um uh friends and family
 
03:32:10.830 --> 03:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
members and constituents is certainly
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
levels the playing field I would liken
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
it to in in some respects whether you're
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
practicing law your certified public
 
03:32:19.630 --> 03:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
accountant or your commercial airline
 
03:32:22.590 --> 03:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
pilot the academic portion of all of
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
that is critically important but
 
03:32:27.309 --> 03:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately those who pass the test then
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
possess the license to do this really uh
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
high-risk work and I would suggest um
 
03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
social workers it's a high-risk work as
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
well and we think that this is really a
 
03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
standardization of the licensing and
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
plays a critical role in vetting as we
 
03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
see it's not an easy exam 70% pass rate
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
I'd say that's consistent with the bar
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
exam in many states as well and it's
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
certainly those that I'm familiar with
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
who have passed not pass those uh lure
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
examinations go back they have to dig in
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
a little more and when they do pass I do
 
03:33:02.349 --> 03:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
believe they emerge as as better
 
03:33:04.030 --> 03:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
Professionals in their chosen
 
03:33:06.150 --> 03:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
field thank you did I answer all your
 
03:33:07.510 --> 03:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions there representative or did I
 
03:33:07.520 --> 03:33:08.830 align:start position:0%
questions there representative or did I
miss

03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
miss
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
something um well I think you answered
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
it the best you're able to give the
 
03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
information aaable
 
03:33:18.910 --> 03:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Leia uh thank
 
03:33:20.269 --> 03:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for being here
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that information about
 
03:33:24.429 --> 03:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
the role uh my question is um since you
 
03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
seem to have a more of a national
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
perspective as well how many other
 
03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
states have this category of the
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker associate and uh
 
03:33:35.429 --> 03:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about the utility
 
03:33:37.189 --> 03:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
overall I understand why people would
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
want it but I'm trying to understand how
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
it fits into the whole red whole
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
framework thank you for the question
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative lean I do not have that
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
information uh uh right now um but
 
03:33:51.070 --> 03:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
certainly when this law was initially
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
passed the the idea was to build
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
capacity and to create another category
 
03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
and um I I think we see this across the
 
03:34:00.269 --> 03:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
country that we are trying to build
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
capacity in all 50 states to make sure
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
that those in need of care receive the
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
care but in growing those numbers we
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that anything that
 
03:34:14.110 --> 03:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
lowers the standard of Entry May
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
compromise the ultimate benefit we hope
 
03:34:19.469 --> 03:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
that patience and fragile individuals
 
03:34:22.990 --> 03:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
receive thank you question be um before
 
03:34:26.590 --> 03:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
I leave to Madam chair I have
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
um a letter from the
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
um Chief Executive Officer of uh The
 
03:34:36.790 --> 03:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Work boards I'd
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
like to leave with you and I also have a
 
03:34:41.229 --> 03:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
letter um that I'd like to leave with
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
you from uh Sheila Reno finigan who is a
 
03:34:46.110 --> 03:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical social work from
 
03:34:49.349 --> 03:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
Pembrook and they're both in opposition
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
to the bill as well you care which side
 
03:34:52.830 --> 03:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
I hand it out
 
03:34:55.710 --> 03:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
to representative Pearson is the closest
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh I'm the mailman but I
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
also have a question yes representative
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
chair and I'll have to lead with this
 
03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the interstate
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
compact that's been
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
referenced I though I I am Vaguely
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
Familiar with it yes so I've got limited
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge of it my question may be for
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
you as well because my concern is that
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
if the is that a lot of the compacts
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
that we enter into have standards have
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
minimum standards have basic
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
requirements because you are in entering
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
into a compact where you can function
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
across state
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
lines uh my concern is the relevancy of
 
03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
this exam to the interstate compact and
 
03:35:41.950 --> 03:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
if there is a an effect with the compact
 
03:35:43.349 --> 03:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
if we remove
 
03:35:46.830 --> 03:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
this it um
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this is a to
 
03:35:52.990 --> 03:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
find that out Mr do you think you can
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
check that for us thank you thank you
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for the question
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to defer we do we do need to
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
know that before
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
deciding all right any other questions
 
03:36:05.550 --> 03:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:25.710 --> 03:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair honorable
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jake
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
Barry I work for new Futures as Miss
 
03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
Stanley indicated earlier uh we worked
 
03:36:34.349 --> 03:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
very closely uh with with you the
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and with uh the nasw back in
 
03:36:39.990 --> 03:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
2021 when lure was originally
 
03:36:41.790 --> 03:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
established I don't want to repeat too
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
much of what has been said this
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon I do want to emphasize our
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
strong support for this bill uh and I do
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
want to uh sort of reinforce a few
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
points that have been made uh when the
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
legislature initially passed uh Cate
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
established lure it was not done so to
 
03:36:58.349 --> 03:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
enhance quality services or patient
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
protections as Miss Stanley indicated it
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
was done uh it was done to bring uh more
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
financial resources and greater
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
Financial stability to our our mental
 
03:37:10.870 --> 03:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
health uh uh our mental health system um
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
certainly to this day uh we
 
03:37:17.110 --> 03:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
have l lwa who continue to practice at
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers without
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
passing the exam uh or without being
 
03:37:23.309 --> 03:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
licensed and they do their jobs very
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
03:37:28.229 --> 03:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
and you know certainly again as Miss
 
03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
Stanley said you know we are an
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
organization that strongly strongly
 
03:37:32.670 --> 03:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
believes in service quality we would not
 
03:37:34.389 --> 03:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
support anything that we believe that
 
03:37:36.910 --> 03:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh uh lessen the quality
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
of of mental health treatment uh
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
available to patients but we do think
 
03:37:43.710 --> 03:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
this is an important step to uh undo
 
03:37:45.550 --> 03:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
what we think is becoming what could be
 
03:37:47.349 --> 03:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
become is becoming an unnecessary
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
barrier to lure uh and therefore an
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barrier for uh uh the influx
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
of insurance reimbursement dollars into
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
a system that desperately needs this
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
money to be able to uh hire more
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
professionals and provide more uh
 
03:38:04.750 --> 03:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
services to those in need um so I think
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is it I'm happy to take questions
 
03:38:07.389 --> 03:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
though I'm sure others in the room can
 
03:38:09.070 --> 03:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
answer them better than I can um
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
actually you might know more about this
 
03:38:16.030 --> 03:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
is this a step on the progress to Li
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
insur as a mental health independent
 
03:38:22.349 --> 03:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor or is this a a
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
low-level position that the people in
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
that position would stay in that
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
position you know it certainly depends
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
on the professional You Know It uh uh
 
03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
you know the these are important
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
services that are provided primarily
 
03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
Case Management Services helping
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
individuals to access the treat you know
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
the treatment they need as far as you
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
know but many of the uh Professionals in
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
this may seek further lure to become you
 
03:38:49.710 --> 03:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
know treatment providers themselves uh
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
so you know we do hope that this does
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
help to create and sort of reinforce the
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
career ladder that it does ultimately
 
03:38:56.429 --> 03:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
lead to further um you know
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
professionals up the chain as well but
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
but these are critical services that are
 
03:39:01.630 --> 03:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
being provided at this level as well do
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
I understand you correctly that it is
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
not part of the normal progression of
 
03:39:11.950 --> 03:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
lure I again the you know the law was
 
03:39:13.630 --> 03:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
just passed in 2021 we just got through
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
rules through last year so it's hard to
 
03:39:17.790 --> 03:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
tell I think yeah okay other questions
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you madam
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
shair thank you very much Mr Barry for
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
being here um you probably know I'm new
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
to this committee um could you could you
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
tell me which Committee in the house
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
this bill came to and how it was
 
03:39:33.389 --> 03:39:33.399 align:start position:0%
received with this language oh my um if
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
you don't know that's all right we can
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
look into it but it' just be good to
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
know sort of what the feel of the
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
committee was when it came through the
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
house yeah I I can tell you you know I
 
03:39:43.630 --> 03:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
think in the end it passed with with
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan support but as far as
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
which committee I don't recall which
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
committee it went through I
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you we'll have to find
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
out represent
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
Gro thank you so
 
03:40:00.030 --> 03:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
here's a little bit so I looked up 330a
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
colon 18c sure and it's about and it's
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
entitled The licensed Social Work
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
associate initial license yes and it has
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
some requirements and
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
typically when one has been un you know
 
03:40:19.750 --> 03:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
capacity after that
 
03:40:27.150 --> 03:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
supervisory period is over then the
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
person that has the license would
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that the person would
 
03:40:37.389 --> 03:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
graduate from that position to The
 
03:40:37.399 --> 03:40:39.349 align:start position:0%
graduate from that position to The
Next

03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
Next
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
Step C certainly that's an option that's
 
03:40:43.710 --> 03:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
open for sure yes mean that's what's
 
03:40:46.750 --> 03:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
typically I think about licensing I
 
03:40:48.910 --> 03:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that everyone's going to
 
03:40:51.870 --> 03:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
stay in the guppy pool forever and swim
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
around there they're going to eventually
 
03:40:55.389 --> 03:40:55.399 align:start position:0%
but what this is what you're
 
03:40:58.349 --> 03:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
asking is for us to eliminate that test
 
03:41:01.349 --> 03:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
and allow all the people who wish to
 
03:41:04.389 --> 03:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
stay at that initial licensing to stay
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
there yes that's right that's right and
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
certainly and and um you know again
 
03:41:11.550 --> 03:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that there is a level of
 
03:41:13.150 --> 03:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
supervision that they are coming in
 
03:41:14.830 --> 03:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
having been educated and trained you
 
03:41:17.550 --> 03:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
know I think that uh um as you said this
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
is initial licensing uh uh um you know
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
and we just it's important to bring
 
03:41:24.670 --> 03:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
people into the field in this way it's
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
important to support the work and we
 
03:41:28.030 --> 03:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to see unnecessary barriers
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh that again don't exist within the
 
03:41:32.229 --> 03:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
community mental health system by the
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
way thank you other
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
questions represent sitech uh Mr Barry
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
so if someone God forbid wants to
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
advance they would eventually have to
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
pass exams
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
written C so that does not go away no no
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely not okay other questions
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Barry thank you
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.600 --> 03:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

03:42:03.550 --> 03:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
much much more than it looked like at
 
03:42:09.990 --> 03:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
the first pass uh House Bill
 
03:42:21.630 --> 03:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
it has the new one hasn't arrived I keep
 
03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:30.319 align:start position:0%

um and I am here today to int introduce
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
oh um which regards Chiropractic for
 
03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
animals um those of you here last term
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
may remember the previous iteration of
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill which was expertly shephered
 
03:42:59.309 --> 03:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
through a subcommittee by former
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
representative Tony leus and a whole
 
03:43:03.870 --> 03:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of really dedicated um members who
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
were um able to work with the various
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um such as the two New
 
03:43:10.590 --> 03:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chiro practic associations the
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veterinary board and oplc
 
03:43:15.790 --> 03:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
to craft language that allowed licensed
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
chiropractors and veterinarians who
 
03:43:19.469 --> 03:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
attended a nationally recognized animal
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic program which was to be
 
03:43:24.429 --> 03:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
determined by the executive director of
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
oplc um to adjust animals without
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
requiring uh veterinary referral and for
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
chiropractors um working without direct
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
supervision of a veterinarian for those
 
03:43:37.510 --> 03:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
of you who were not here last year I'll
 
03:43:40.590 --> 03:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
give a brief beef brief background of
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
why this is important um in the United
 
03:43:44.670 --> 03:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
States chiropractors are considered
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
primary care doctors which means you
 
03:43:49.469 --> 03:43:49.479 align:start position:0%
don't need a referral to see one so you
 
03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
can take your child to a chiropractor
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
without a doctor referral but currently
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
with animals it's kind of a gray area
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
and one that is currently being
 
03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
addressed by a lot of States um and will
 
03:44:02.910 --> 03:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
eventually have to be addressed by all
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
states um because um people are becoming
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
more and more aware of the benefits of
 
03:44:12.149 --> 03:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic for animals um at this
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
point um getting veterinary referral can
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
take weeks because there's somewhat of a
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
shortage of veterinarians and um it can
 
03:44:24.080 --> 03:44:24.090 align:start position:0%
also be prohibitively expensive so
 
03:44:24.090 --> 03:44:25.349 align:start position:0%
also be prohibitively expensive so
[Music]

03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
um in my own um my own uh interest in
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
animal chiropract came about as a result
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
of someone plowing into my truck at a
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
gas station um I had my little dog with
 
03:44:40.269 --> 03:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
me he was in a body harness buckled into
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
a dog car seat but um he was seriously
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
injured and he was miserable and
 
03:44:45.870 --> 03:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have survived without
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
benefit of an amazing chiropractor who
 
03:44:50.590 --> 03:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
in one visit fixed the problem relieved
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
his pain he did this big old doggy shake
 
03:44:54.990 --> 03:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
and wagged his tail and off he went he
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
was fine um last year we also heard
 
03:44:59.710 --> 03:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from a woman whose dog wasn't
 
03:45:01.389 --> 03:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
doing well and she and her husband were
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
not in a financial position to take her
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
for veterinary care but they heard about
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic and also within just
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
one visit the dog was back to her happy
 
03:45:15.309 --> 03:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
self so uh anyway the the bill last year
 
03:45:17.070 --> 03:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
sailed through the house and the Senate
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
and um at the last minute there was
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
concern about the lack of explicit
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
language uh regarding who is eligible
 
03:45:25.870 --> 03:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
the original Bill language said that
 
03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
anyone attending a nationally recognized
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic program would be
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
exempt from Veterinary license licensing
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
but um since only chiropractors and
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
veterinarians can get in those programs
 
03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
no one really expressed concern at that
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
time but at the last minute it was felt
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
that the language should be more
 
03:45:46.990 --> 03:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
explicit it and more explicitly Express
 
03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
that only doctors of Chiropractic and
 
03:45:51.790 --> 03:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
doctors of veterinary medicine who
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
attend a nationally recognized
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic program would be exempt
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
from Veterinary licensing so with this
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
new more explicit language it's my hope
 
03:46:02.590 --> 03:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire can move forward with
 
03:46:04.630 --> 03:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
this matter settled so that caring
 
03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
animal owners can access this amazing
 
03:46:09.550 --> 03:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
care quickly and
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
affordably thank you are there any
 
03:46:15.550 --> 03:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:20.110 --> 03:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
03:46:22.269 --> 03:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
chair representative good to see you
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
03:46:28.149 --> 03:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
so is this bill is essentially or is it
 
03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
only is it identical or is it only
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
essentially similar to the legislation
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
you brought to us in the last year that
 
03:46:42.189 --> 03:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
did pass uh the house as I recall um and
 
03:46:44.349 --> 03:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
did die in the Senate what happened it
 
03:46:47.149 --> 03:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
was V by the governor Ved by the
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
governor the there is a report from our
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
researcher on the history of animal
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
chiropractor bills which we have
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
provided to you thank you so is it is it
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
the same bill it's it's essentially the
 
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
same the only thing that changed is that
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
the former Bill said anyone attending a
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized program and it now
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
says any veterinarian or chiropractor
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
licensed chiropractor who attends these
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized programs follow up
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank so as I recall there there
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
were a number of people that came before
 
03:47:20.110 --> 03:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
us the last time with similar stories of
 
03:47:21.870 --> 03:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties in getting an appointment
 
03:47:24.429 --> 03:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
with a chiropractor to have a referral
 
03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
to with sorry I Had It reversed getting
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
a referral from a veterinarian to be
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
able to to go to a
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
chiropractor uh and to the degree you've
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
got an animal in pain discomfort
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
dysfunction um and you're waiting
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
for weeks whatever with an animal can't
 
03:47:46.910 --> 03:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
tell you it's so it's back a little bit
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
farther right and I'm really hurting and
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
I really need help yeah um so that's the
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
only change and um I spoke with one of
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
the um directors of the Chiropractic
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
Association last night who said that he
 
03:48:02.110 --> 03:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
both he and the other Association were
 
03:48:05.110 --> 03:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
fully on board with it now so I think we
 
03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
going to hear from them I don't see them
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
here but um I I'm happy to to um get
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony from them or something
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh anyway as far as I know everyone is
 
03:48:19.950 --> 03:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
on board with the new language it just
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
the reason we didn't worry about it last
 
03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
time is because even though it said
 
03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
anyone who attends a nationally
 
03:48:28.189 --> 03:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
recognized program would fall under this
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
um we weren't worried because you had to
 
03:48:32.590 --> 03:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
be a chiropractor or a vet to get into
 
03:48:35.110 --> 03:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
the program but somebody just wanted it
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
to be more explicit so this passed on
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
consent here and unanimously in the
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
Senate consent in the house and
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate so I think
 
03:48:46.590 --> 03:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
that with these slight changes nobody
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
will object and it should should go
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
through nicely represent
 
03:48:53.149 --> 03:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so I'm
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the governor's veto message
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the talking about uh and talking
 
03:49:04.149 --> 03:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
about his uh reason why he said that
 
03:49:05.710 --> 03:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
there was a number of concerns brought
 
03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
up by stakeholders have those been
 
03:49:10.349 --> 03:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
addressed yeah I'm not quite sure why he
 
03:49:12.429 --> 03:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
said a number this was the main problem
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
it was um uh as far as far as I have
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
heard it was a president of one of the
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic associations who's no
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
longer there but um it that's the thing
 
03:49:23.149 --> 03:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
they wanted addressed all right thank
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
long I got an email from a veterinarian
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
opposing this who said I forget the
 
03:49:34.149 --> 03:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
exact details but said something about
 
03:49:36.990 --> 03:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
there not being any exam or any sort of
 
03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:38.429 align:start position:0%
there not being any exam or any sort of
performance

03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
performance
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
standards uh that people will be held
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
accountable to uh and I'm just wondering
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
do you know what's involv involved in
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
completion of an animal Chiropractic
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
program and if that involves some kind
 
03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
of performance examination to ensure
 
03:49:54.750 --> 03:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
people actually have the skills of the
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
program is right thank you for asking
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
because apparently there was a
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding last year about that
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
very subject that there it was believed
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
somehow that this was going to eliminate
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
licensing and it does not the people who
 
03:50:08.830 --> 03:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
go are either veterinarians are already
 
03:50:10.830 --> 03:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
licensed chiropractors and I don't know
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
the details of these programs but they
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
are nationally recognized programs with
 
03:50:18.149 --> 03:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
and it it specifies that it has to be
 
03:50:20.030 --> 03:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
programs accepted by the director of
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
oplc and they are currently practicing
 
03:50:23.950 --> 03:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
all over the country and several states
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
have already addressed this and are
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
moving ahead
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
brilliantly so it's not just anyone who
 
03:50:34.830 --> 03:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
wants to practice you have to go to a
 
03:50:36.149 --> 03:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized program and you
 
03:50:38.110 --> 03:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
would already be a chiropractor or
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarian anyway so you would
 
03:50:42.269 --> 03:50:42.279 align:start position:0%
understand the mechanisms and and
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:47.040 --> 03:50:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
other

03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:50.600 align:start position:0%

that want to utilize a
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
chiropractor we believe this bill allows
 
03:51:42.269 --> 03:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
him to do that without any other
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%

a request of the hospital

sponsorship of this bill the orig
 
04:03:06.750 --> 04:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
origins of this bill stem directly from
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
Health Force New Hampshire a Statewide
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
collaborative of healthcare
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
professionals including Educators and
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapists who work with our
 
04:03:13.399 --> 04:03:14.630 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapists who work with our
Hospital

04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
and they help to grow retain and sustain
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
a skilled Healthcare Workforce in our
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
state they reached out to us to share
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
that many other States including Maine
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Massachusetts allow
 
04:03:27.870 --> 04:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy students to work
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
under a temporary license they have seen
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
firsthand that students opt to work in
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
other states not New Hampshire because
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
they can easily obtain a temporary
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
license to work while still a student
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapists are really hard
 
04:03:44.149 --> 04:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
to recruit as of October 2024 based on a
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
recent report that we uh Co collated
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
21.7% vacancy rate for Hospital employed
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapists if we could
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
encourage students to work while going
 
04:03:56.830 --> 04:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
to school here in New Hampshire there
 
04:03:59.309 --> 04:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
may be a higher higher likelihood of
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
them deciding to stay and work in our
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
state once they have graduated we need
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
to remove barriers to recruiting healthc
 
04:04:07.309 --> 04:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals such as respiratory
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
therapists and this bill is a great step
 
04:04:11.510 --> 04:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
in that direction so the bill does
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
essentially three things it adds a new
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
SE ction for a student temporary license
 
04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
and defines the limited scope to being a
 
04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
student working in a healthcare setting
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
under supervision who may practice for a
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
limited period of time and may only
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
practice the skills that they have shown
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
competency in this also requires rul
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
making by
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
oplc it adds language to distinguish
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
routine a student practicing their
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
clinical skills strictly as a student
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
versus working as a temporary
 
04:04:41.790 --> 04:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
temporarily licensed respiratory
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
therapist and lastly it requires that
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
the student must show their employer
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
their temporary license so thank you for
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide our comments
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
on this bill and happy to answer any
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative scitec you
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
repeat your second point please the
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
second point was it adds language to
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
distinguish between a student practicing
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
their clinical skill set strictly as a
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
student so many uh clinical students
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
usually spend time in hospitals
 
04:05:10.189 --> 04:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
practicing their skill set while they're
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
a student versus there's also time that
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
they could spend working and getting
 
04:05:18.349 --> 04:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
paid for that work to uh work under a
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapist during their time
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
and that would be when they would be
 
04:05:22.279 --> 04:05:23.750 align:start position:0%
and that would be when they would be
temporarily

04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
04:05:26.590 --> 04:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
licensed follow up so this would
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
authorize them to work in addition to
 
04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
their student activ practicing their
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
skill set correct the second question if
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
I may yes uh would you spell your last
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
name the thunberg part sure it's uh t h
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
u n b RG and you should have re received
 
04:05:46.349 --> 04:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
a copy of my testimony as
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
you are there other
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative you so this
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
might be better addressed by oplc but in
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
the case because I see that in Ru making
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
they'll be the ones who um put together
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
the rules for this if a student decides
 
04:06:06.309 --> 04:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to be in this class
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
anymore and they leave the school I
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
would imagine then they would lose their
 
04:06:13.030 --> 04:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
license to they would lose their
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
temporary license right because they
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to be enrolled in the class I
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
believe that would be the case and I'm
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
sure oplc could address exactly how that
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
would uh be structured they'd also would
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
lose their supervisory um oversight too
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
if they decided to not be working there
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
either thank you thank you thank you
 
04:06:34.750 --> 04:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none I have one
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative here sorry um
 
04:06:38.149 --> 04:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
and this is you may not be able to
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
answer this one because you mentioned a
 
04:06:43.229 --> 04:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
21% vacancy rate so that it it just let
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
me two thoughts uh how long does it take
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
to become a respiratory therapist there
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
is one school in New Hampshire I believe
 
04:06:53.790 --> 04:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's River Valley um that does it I
 
04:06:55.710 --> 04:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
believe it's a two-year program yeah
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
what does a respiratory therapist make I
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
mean what kind off the top of my head I
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
do not know but I can find out for you
 
04:07:03.070 --> 04:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
all right just that was just curious y
 
04:07:03.080 --> 04:07:04.590 align:start position:0%
all right just that was just curious y
thank

04:07:04.590 --> 04:07:04.600 align:start position:0%

you good afternoon it's nice to see you
 
04:07:34.349 --> 04:07:34.359 align:start position:0%

04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
jurus executive director
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
oplc and Nicholas fry general
 
04:07:42.670 --> 04:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
counsel representative go did you have a
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you I just wanted to
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that in the ru making you're
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
planning on you're going to have a plan
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
for students who decide that they don't
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
want to continue with their education in
 
04:08:01.389 --> 04:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
early so um are you kind of alluding to
 
04:08:05.840 --> 04:08:06.910 align:start position:0%
early so um are you kind of alluding to
the

04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
twoyear right so there there's two
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
scenarios that could happen right so um
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
if someone is leaving licenser one of
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
the requirements is that they're a
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
student so once they're no longer a
 
04:08:20.670 --> 04:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
student they can't have that license the
 
04:08:22.269 --> 04:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
second component is if they are
 
04:08:23.710 --> 04:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
continuing on being a student then they
 
04:08:25.710 --> 04:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
could renew that
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
license thank
 
04:08:32.109 --> 04:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative SL I need
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
pronunciation I I'm hoping you can
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
correct my understanding it it it sounds
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
as though there's a student license
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
involved in this uh legislation does
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
that sound fair uh can you explain um
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
this the section of the legislation
 
04:08:49.630 --> 04:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
performed without a license by a student
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
is is there some segment of the student
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
population who will be exempt from lure
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
or am I simply
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding are you referring to um
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
I'm looking on four Respiratory Care
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
practice exemptions from lure you
 
04:09:04.590 --> 04:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
talking about that section right there I
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
believe it's uh line
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
26 yes okay yeah so that's the exemption
 
04:09:13.030 --> 04:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
statute so there's a carve out for um
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
certain students that are doing
 
04:09:17.070 --> 04:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
something for their clinical practice so
 
04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
that's an exemption this is to actually
 
04:09:22.269 --> 04:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
allow uh The Lure is to allow students
 
04:09:24.269 --> 04:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
to work at hospitals on their own that
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
are farther along in their
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
matriculations thank
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you and uh just to ask another
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
clarifying question for myself so um
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is one that do not be required for
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
students who just want to do their
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
course workor only for those who want to
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
make some money while practicing their
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes represent so I apologize you may
 
04:09:52.870 --> 04:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
have uh said it and I didn't catch it uh
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
are you taking a position on the bill
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
are you for General infro no position
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
the one thing we would ask though is
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
that if the if the bill does go through
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful for us to have the
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
language temporary student license used
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
consistently throughout this uh proposed
 
04:10:12.269 --> 04:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
bill or what would become a statute just
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
from our perspective because because we
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
have temporary licenses that we already
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
deal with and this would be um it would
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
just be less confusing for
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
us thank you so just for your reference
 
04:10:24.790 --> 04:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
we've identified in the printed Bill
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
line 15 a student has OB who has
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
obtained a temporary license if the word
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
student could be entered so consistent
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
with lines 12 and
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
13 just a temporary license means
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
something different so temporary student
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
license would be specific just to this
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
and would just help us operationalize
 
04:10:46.590 --> 04:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and if there's no further
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much is there
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wanted to speak on this
 
04:10:56.070 --> 04:10:56.080 align:start position:0%

representing marac 27 and House Bill 82
 
04:31:35.469 --> 04:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
is a request of the
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
oplc it is essentially a compilation of
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
the cleanup language that was submitted
 
04:31:46.189 --> 04:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
last year on bills that didn't pass we
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
had a number of them that we either
 
04:31:52.870 --> 04:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
voted to kill for other reasons or we
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
with um retained in committee and were
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
not passed but there this does not have
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
any policy differences it is
 
04:32:05.469 --> 04:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
purely cleaning up the statutory
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
conflict between the various licensing
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
boards language and the oplc
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
it if you look at the list of
 
04:32:17.199 --> 04:32:19.510 align:start position:0%
it if you look at the list of
professions

04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
professions
 
04:32:23.469 --> 04:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
involved the last three I believe are
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
not actually addressed except to be
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
added to the list of boards license
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
commissions Etc that are covered under
 
04:32:35.349 --> 04:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
the oplc like the voluntary dual and
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
lactation specialist the nurse agency
 
04:32:45.550 --> 04:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.189 --> 04:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
um I also have an amendment which I
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
passed out earlier which adds in some
 
04:32:54.030 --> 04:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
language that I had thought I'd included
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill but didn't uh this is to
 
04:33:01.229 --> 04:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
clarify under the Medical Imaging
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
Professionals that no matter how many
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
Specialties you are qualified for you
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
only need one license this is what has
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
been done all
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
along but some lawyer read the statute
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
and said oh you ought to have a a
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
separate license for each modality which
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
seems redundant uh this amendment uh
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
0010 H just says you have a license and
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
you've proven um your qualifications for
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
every every modality you're licensed for
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
those modalities just to simplify
 
04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
things I will try to answer any
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
questions there are any questions from
 
04:33:48.189 --> 04:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
the county representative gr thank you
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
Madame um yeah thank you madam chair um
 
04:33:54.269 --> 04:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire when we were um
 
04:33:58.029 --> 04:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
addressing the bill the the um these
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
boards last
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
year they were sort of set aside from
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
the other boards who underwent this type
 
04:34:07.230 --> 04:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
of change I'm hold on could uh there's
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
some confusion as to whether since you
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
were listed as a co-sponsor whether you
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
can ask questions or not yes sorry I I
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
will mention that for example the uh
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
podiatrists there was no objection to
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
their statutory cleanup but the bill
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
that it was it was addressed in was a
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill to combine the board of Podiatry
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Medicine and that
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
policy was not accepted until the bill
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
was killed and this part was lost and
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
similarly for some of the other uh
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
professions I have a question the chair
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
um have have we changed policy I thought
 
04:34:47.670 --> 04:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
that if you were a co-sponsor you had to
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
decide whether you would testify or ask
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions but you you simply couldn't do
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
both but you could do one or the other
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you that was my understanding
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
as well I don't know that might be
 
04:34:59.789 --> 04:34:59.799 align:start position:0%
something that we should ask the um ask
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
the clerk to find out that information I
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
mean that's been policy in the past I
 
04:35:05.551 --> 04:35:05.561 align:start position:0%
just unless unless at a chairs meeting
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's been stated differently normally
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
you like you say if you're offering
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
testimony you do don't ask questions and
 
04:35:13.840 --> 04:35:15.310 align:start position:0%
testimony you do don't ask questions and
uh

04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
prefer preferably even if you are not
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
providing testimony you don't actively
 
04:35:23.470 --> 04:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh ask questions but there may be cases
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
where information is
 
04:35:28.349 --> 04:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
needed and that has been my
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
understanding in the past as well I was
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
asked the question by the clerk as to
 
04:35:34.349 --> 04:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
whether that was the appropriate process
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's one where we can get more
 
04:35:38.029 --> 04:35:38.039 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay and then I do have an actual
 
04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
question then representative Pearson for
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
an actual question thank you madam chair
 
04:35:47.629 --> 04:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
the on uh page four in the middle 19 um
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're striking out if the office denies
 
04:35:51.869 --> 04:35:51.879 align:start position:0%
the issuance of a license or temporary
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
permit to any applicant the initial fee
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
deposited shall be retained as an
 
04:35:55.119 --> 04:35:56.590 align:start position:0%
deposited shall be retained as an
application

04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
fee oplc has to
 
04:36:03.869 --> 04:36:03.879 align:start position:0%
process these applications which which
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
is work uh why would that not why would
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
we not retain that if it is taking up
 
04:36:13.949 --> 04:36:13.959 align:start position:0%
their time question of application fees
 
04:36:19.349 --> 04:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
is covered in the um oplc statute and
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
rules rather than in each professional
 
04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
or statute this one is only about
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
engineers okay I'm getting the head nod
 
04:36:29.310 --> 04:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
from the from the boss back there so and
 
04:36:33.629 --> 04:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.709 --> 04:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
that thank you and we now have
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
clarification that if you're a
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor you can either well for
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
anything you can either testify or you
 
04:36:42.189 --> 04:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
can participate on the Community
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
Committee side and ask questions so you
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
both I didn't know if there was more of
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
a question that you had representative
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
gr or if that was the whole
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
question I'll try again um thank you so
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
the under house bill 655 one of the
 
04:37:06.029 --> 04:37:06.039 align:start position:0%
things that we did
 
04:37:12.189 --> 04:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
is set up a statute for the oplc office
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
where all of these requirements that are
 
04:37:16.830 --> 04:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
being repealed by the individual boards
 
04:37:20.910 --> 04:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
were placed underneath that
 
04:37:23.470 --> 04:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
statute so I just want to make sure and
 
04:37:25.869 --> 04:37:25.879 align:start position:0%
I I believe this is right that all we're
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
doing is taking the boards that had not
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
been considered in that Administration
 
04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
change to to to make these boards
 
04:37:36.510 --> 04:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
compliant with all the other boards
 
04:37:38.349 --> 04:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
where this previous legislation is
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
passed that is the intent and that's
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
what I try to do if I was wrong uh we'll
 
04:37:44.959 --> 04:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
what I try to do if I was wrong uh we'll
fix

04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%

consolidate rather than to have separate
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh sections because my uh email that I
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
sent to her and the
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor uh this morning was not
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
answered because of the uh business here
 
04:39:32.670 --> 04:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
and uh it deals
 
04:39:32.680 --> 04:39:35.470 align:start position:0%
and uh it deals
with

04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:39:35.480 --> 04:39:37.708 align:start position:0%
with
u

04:39:37.708 --> 04:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
u
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
at lines 24 to 28 dealing with
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
auctioneers and I know that uh you know
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
you're changing it off from the uh board
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
to the office of oplc I understand that
 
04:39:56.910 --> 04:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
but number
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
38 uh could the sponsor maybe come back
 
04:40:03.310 --> 04:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
and explain to me and you uh if she has
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
not done already of why that you're
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
getting rid of
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
the uh 31-b colon 5 r numeral
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
five relative to
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications regarding
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
character is that
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
possible yes thank
 
04:40:24.718 --> 04:40:31.430 align:start position:0%
possible yes thank
you

04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.190 --> 04:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
problem yes that that qualification of
 
04:40:39.270 --> 04:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
good professional character and with no
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
details was primarily Al used for
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination it was used to
 
04:40:52.110 --> 04:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
block um unfavored social groups or on a
 
04:40:57.150 --> 04:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
racial or sexual basis and it is subject
 
04:40:57.160 --> 04:40:59.590 align:start position:0%
racial or sexual basis and it is subject
to

04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
um bias
 
04:41:05.788 --> 04:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
and irregular application it is not
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
something that the office can judge so
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
when they're doing the um
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
the application they can't say good
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
professional character check what the
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for the auctioneers do
 
04:41:23.550 --> 04:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
require is personal references from
 
04:41:23.560 --> 04:41:24.590 align:start position:0%
require is personal references from
other

04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:41:27.910 --> 04:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
auctioneers and it is it is expected
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
that they will be
 
04:41:33.270 --> 04:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the per the person's
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
good good professional character by
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
because of their recommendations and we
 
04:41:40.750 --> 04:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe it should be in statute
 
04:41:46.110 --> 04:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
enforced thank you very much for that
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
clarification we do assume good
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
professional character on the part of
 
04:41:52.798 --> 04:41:57.670 align:start position:0%
professional character on the part of
all

04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
Carol no Carol for years she's a good
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
State Rep from epom Epsom I think it is
 
04:42:11.948 --> 04:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
it is yes representative from yeah where
 
04:42:14.910 --> 04:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
I used to go years ago to Barbara and
 
04:42:16.830 --> 04:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
Frank Anderson's Sherwood in with the
 
04:42:18.270 --> 04:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
Trojan Horse on
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
there listening in on the Constitution
 
04:42:25.230 --> 04:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
where I first met David uh David Welch
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
he told me years ago he used to go there
 
04:42:30.190 --> 04:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
I didn't know him as a 20-year-old you
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
know but anyways uh thank you Carol
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
again and then because of the uh excuse
 
04:42:42.030 --> 04:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
me Mr hos in this room representative
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire outside you can call her what
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
you like but here she's representative
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire okay yeah exactly you're right
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.440 --> 04:42:56.070 align:start position:0%
 
anytime

04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah she said that it's it's been
 
04:43:01.948 --> 04:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
used for uh discrimination purposes but
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's only one purpose of that Roman
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
numeral 5 because if you look back on
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 it does say that other
 
04:43:13.230 --> 04:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
auctioneers uh can can file uh paperwork
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
to uh either discredit the person or to
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
appraise them so it would be nice to
 
04:43:18.718 --> 04:43:20.310 align:start position:0%
appraise them so it would be nice to
maybe

04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
redefine uh that Roman numeral five to
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
exclude uh misuse of that for uh racial
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
purposes because I uh put into my
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
email that I was at the board of
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
auctioneers on a complaint
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I was talking about absolute
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
auctions and one of the members said oh
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that can occur at any time I said
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
no no no read the
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
definition uh I put it in here you know
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
has to be at the same time place cannot
 
04:43:58.350 --> 04:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
be continued to a later date and even in
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
New York they have a statute on the
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
books that said the uh backup bidder
 
04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
even the bidder or the backup bidder
 
04:44:08.190 --> 04:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
cannot come forward at a later time to
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
rebid and that's something that you
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
could look into to perhaps put into New
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute as an analogy as a uh
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
side uh well s similar
 
04:44:23.310 --> 04:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
statue and uh I did listen to the
 
04:44:24.990 --> 04:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
presentation this
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
morning not listen watch I should say
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
and read the captions my speakers
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh the new commissioner over there she
 
04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
said that uh they don't want to have to
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
I mean these people work for a
 
04:44:47.230 --> 04:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
livelihood and that's fine and if they
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
screw up then uh you know discipline
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
them and if they screw up too much then
 
04:44:53.948 --> 04:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
oust them and then get another job and
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
another uh
 
04:44:58.510 --> 04:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
profession and uh so I do have a real
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
estate case over there I can tell you
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
about that I won't bore you to that with
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
that and but uh the way I look at it
 
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
over there what it is it's a prot
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
protection racket because they're
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
protecting their people that pay
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
their could you just keep to the policy
 
04:45:15.868 --> 04:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
and not make
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
accusations sir well I'm I'm talking
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
about character the word character isn't
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
here so even while uh they're being
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
tried to be admitted you know they're
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
applying for the uh license to be an
 
04:45:31.470 --> 04:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer that once they're in that
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop there the continuation of
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
character should go above and beyond
 
04:45:39.390 --> 04:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
because I was at uh Governor Kelly's uh
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
inaugurate well her first uh GNC meeting
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
yesterday and the pastor over there the
 
04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
father he said let's have his truth and
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
Justice uh go further by your activities
 
04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
over here I always like to say let a
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
truth go marching on like in the song of
 
04:46:01.550 --> 04:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
the Civil War but anyways uh that being
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
said the last thing I want to say too is
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
that your character is in question too
 
04:46:09.070 --> 04:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
all of you because I complained to the
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
house Speaker I said Article 15 of the
 
04:46:13.310 --> 04:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution says
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
compensation compensation is payment for
 
04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
a loss you have to use your time here
 
04:46:20.190 --> 04:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
then you get paid to be paid upfront
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
like an attorney retainer is wrong so
 
04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
you being a judge of other people's
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
character first your character should be
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
corrected an error that uh is not
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
corrected becomes a mistake so it would
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
be nice for you to look into that and do
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
something about it thank you uh thank
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
you sir and we'll take a look at this I
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
think a lot of those things end up in
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
rules as not just in the laws but we
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
will take a closeup all right look thank
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.868 --> 04:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
Rancourt uh representing ecba so I'd
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%

we represent over 65 actual contractors
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
about 300 um employee so um we had a
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
concern on page 11 um the section starts
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:22.840 --> 04:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
36

04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
36
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
and I can read it I just it's if you
 
04:47:29.548 --> 04:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
start on line 35 says any
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
person failing to pass his or her first
 
04:47:34.030 --> 04:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
examination by
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
re-examination by an examination entity
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
approved by the board that's all
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
existing obviously within one year of
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:47:44.548 --> 04:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
examination and thereafter may be
 
04:47:47.788 --> 04:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
examined as often as as desired the way
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we we just feel that we not sure
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
the intent but the way that it reads it
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
seems like you can only reexamine one
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
more time in that onee period and that's
 
04:47:56.990 --> 04:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
never been the case so we're just trying
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
to determine if that's trying to only
 
04:48:00.990 --> 04:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to reexamine one more time or
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
if they can still continue to reexamine
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
one more time and what they're saying is
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
you can only reexamine one more time
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
without filling out a new application
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
we're not sure if that's what the intent
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
of it was was and if so it should say
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
that so they kind of get one re-exam
 
04:48:16.590 --> 04:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
without an additional application
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
because I believe through their are um
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
rsas they have to act on the application
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
within 90 days so it just leaves us I
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
brought this to a couple of board
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
members and we all have some questions
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
to how it's written and what their
 
04:48:30.990 --> 04:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
intent is not necessarily disagree but
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
we like some clarification to try to fix
 
04:48:35.430 --> 04:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
the wording if possible thank you that's
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
very helpful insight um that's this is
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
why it's great to have public testimony
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
are there any questions that we have
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we will uh this will
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
be going to once we're done I'm sure
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
it'll be going to the it will be going
 
04:48:48.990 --> 04:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
to the licensing subcommittee so they
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
will work hard on these details thank
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh next we have Mark um
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
condr Mary I'll have you correct me on
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
that because uh I got a little
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
intimidated and you are representing the
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you it's U Mark condo
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
dematra thank you
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes you're familiar with it I see
 
04:49:21.600 --> 04:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
yes you're familiar with it I see
no

04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:49:26.350 --> 04:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
um so I represent the New Hampshire land
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
surveyance Association uh we are the
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
first section of this bill uh that is
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
being um proposed uh to be affected and
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
I I understand um why and the reasoning
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh that the sections that are being
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
repealed are in here I understand um
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the consolidation
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
of information Ru making discipline Etc
 
04:49:51.638 --> 04:49:52.590 align:start position:0%
of information Ru making discipline Etc
through

04:49:52.590 --> 04:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
oplc uh I
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
certainly am not necessarily um in favor
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
of every aspect of it uh but it just it
 
04:50:04.990 --> 04:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
just seems
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
that we've been here now for I believe
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
three sessions in dealing with this
 
04:50:12.830 --> 04:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
change and it seems every single time
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
some part of this transition has been
 
04:50:16.120 --> 04:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
some part of this transition has been
overlooked

04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
overlooked
 
04:50:20.990 --> 04:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
and this seems to be no different um
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are multiple repeals in here where
 
04:50:25.868 --> 04:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
you're repealing rulemaking uh of the
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
land surveyors uh statute um you're
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
repealing the rule making for retired
 
04:50:33.788 --> 04:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
status um expiration and renewals which
 
04:50:35.310 --> 04:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
I understand is all part of
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
administration that you know typical
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
day-to-day work that oplc you know
 
04:50:42.548 --> 04:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
should be managing overseeing um but
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
then you're also repealing um
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions and specifically
 
04:50:52.510 --> 04:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 310 a70 is set to be repealed um
 
04:50:54.990 --> 04:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
which lists certain violations that the
 
04:50:57.910 --> 04:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
board can look at and refer to for
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action which is a standard
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
boilerplate information drug use bad
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
practice you know not being a good
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
Steward of the license Etc um but in
 
04:51:09.120 --> 04:51:12.230 align:start position:0%
Steward of the license Etc um but in
310a

04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
586 it specifically says that the board
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
is required to be met by each holder of
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
a license to practice under the
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision and how disciplinary actions
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
by the board shall be implemented for
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
violations of these
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
standards so according to the statute
 
04:51:31.948 --> 04:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
the board is still going to maintain
 
04:51:36.548 --> 04:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
some Authority for disciplinary actions
 
04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
yet the list of what the disciplinary
 
04:51:42.310 --> 04:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
actions are is being being
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
repealed so we're back to square one
 
04:51:49.270 --> 04:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
again which is I guess we overlooked
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
something and are we now going to come
 
04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
back in the next session and fix this or
 
04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
it it it creates uncertainty and it
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
creates instability on what happens now
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
when people are violating these statutes
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to practice and what we
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
are seeing on an association level is a
 
04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
significant increase
 
04:52:14.230 --> 04:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
in people that are now practicing either
 
04:52:17.788 --> 04:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
without a license um shoddy work you
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
know maybe they're not following all the
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
rules for uh for the for time reasons
 
04:52:27.390 --> 04:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
Etc you know we know obviously it's very
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to find a lot of licensed
 
04:52:31.948 --> 04:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
professions everybody's busy you know
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's the economy Etc um not as many
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
people coming into the workforce Etc uh
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
but it just seems that it would be nice
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
if when this
 
04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
information for repeal and
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
consolidation is
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
proposed uh it would be in a more
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
detailed thoughtful format in such a way
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
as to not create confusion as to what
 
04:52:57.708 --> 04:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
exactly this specifically does um
 
04:52:58.990 --> 04:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
because you know again you're repealing
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
certain things but then there's other
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
things that still stand so now who has
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
the power of what and who's going to
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
decide what's what and it would just be
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
04:53:13.548 --> 04:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
if there was a a consistent standard
 
04:53:15.750 --> 04:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
that people could understand follow and
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
know and we wouldn't be in this state of
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
limbo per se that um it's it's gray you
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
know now who is gonna maintain what and
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
who has certain authority over what so
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm certainly in understandment of
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
this but uh I think that there's
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
definitely more work that would need to
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
be done and we as an association are are
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
happy to provide our resources es
 
04:53:44.830 --> 04:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
to you uh to help go through this on a
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
very detailed way so that when it is
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
done it's done correctly one time
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
without any unintended consequences and
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
that's our big concern is that we see
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
the unintended the unintended
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
consequences that occur as a result of
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
some of this slipshod you know language
 
04:54:04.110 --> 04:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we're then coming back that's
 
04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
housekeeping right so you know we just
 
04:54:09.868 --> 04:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
want to do this um in a very consistent
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know thoughtful way so thank you
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate you calling us
 
04:54:17.788 --> 04:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
calling attention to that and um I I
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
have a similar one I had 150 ft left out
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%

mckenny thank you madam chairwoman my

I uh carry both a land surveyor license
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
and a uh Foresters license I have uh
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
some grave concerns about the direction
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
the office is going uh my comments today
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
are limited just to the first 12 lines
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill on page one with respect to
 
04:55:03.000 --> 04:55:03.948 align:start position:0%
of the bill on page one with respect to
land

04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:55:03.958 --> 04:55:05.590 align:start position:0%
land
surveying

04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
surveying
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm very concerned that the members
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
of the board themselves are being
 
04:55:14.548 --> 04:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
stripped of the authority to in their
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
opinion uh review applications and
 
04:55:20.670 --> 04:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
determine who has met the requirements
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
for lure I think that's a step in a a
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally wrong
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
direction uh as Mark stated before me
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the disciplinary
 
04:55:34.590 --> 04:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
procedure I'd like to think that uh were
 
04:55:36.708 --> 04:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
there to be a complaint filed against me
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
that I would be judged by a jury of my
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
peers who have some land surveying
 
04:55:47.670 --> 04:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
experience and I would ask what
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications knowledge experience uh
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
or judgment do members of the staff at
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
the office have to sit in judgment for
 
04:56:03.310 --> 04:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.310 --> 04:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
profession the purpose of lure is to
 
04:56:08.708 --> 04:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
protect the public welfare and I'm not
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure that overall with respect to land
 
04:56:14.910 --> 04:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
owners here or excuse me with respect to
 
04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
surveyors and particularly to land
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
owners that this is taking us in the
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
right direction uh particularly since
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
landowning members of the public who
 
04:56:29.830 --> 04:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
engage land surveyors we are tasked with
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
surveying and defining or
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
recovering what is perhaps in the
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
majority of cases the most valuable
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
asset that they own so thank
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%

04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and the only remaining card I
 
04:56:51.628 --> 04:56:51.638 align:start position:0%

thank

04:57:03.310 --> 04:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon again just for the
 
04:57:08.830 --> 04:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
record de jurus executive director oplc
 
04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to speak broadly
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
um the as noted this bill was a request
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the office and I just wanted to
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
clarify that the the intent behind the
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
Drafting and that working with
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire was just that to
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
do the cleanup statute so the policy
 
04:57:26.590 --> 04:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
changes this committee has already
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
recommended it's been voted on you know
 
04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
through the whole legislature signed by
 
04:57:32.548 --> 04:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
the governor in his current law so this
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually is to avoid confusion because
 
04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
there's conflicting statute but the 310
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
changes the umbrella for the office are
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
currently controlling um I'm going to
 
04:57:44.430 --> 04:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
leave attorney fry to speak to um some
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
specific things just from our listening
 
04:57:48.830 --> 04:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the other testimony um but just
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that um I will say
 
04:57:53.788 --> 04:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
specific to the electricians exam the
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
intent was to the the office has that
 
04:57:59.708 --> 04:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
obligation to process them and currently
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
the statute reads that an application
 
04:58:04.990 --> 04:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
could be open for 13 years and somebody
 
04:58:07.310 --> 04:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
could come back and take an exam um
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
operationally like the office cannot
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
hold those license applications open
 
04:58:12.628 --> 04:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
that long and there's other statutory
 
04:58:14.070 --> 04:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
implications so I'll just say when it
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
goes to subcommittee we're we're happy
 
04:58:18.548 --> 04:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
to work it with you to to make sure that
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
that intent is realized the wording is
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
correct and that we we can
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
operationalize what what we'd like there
 
04:58:25.548 --> 04:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
so just happy to work with you on that
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there'll be some discussion
 
04:58:29.788 --> 04:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
so we're not married to that language
 
04:58:30.910 --> 04:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we're able to
 
04:58:32.948 --> 04:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
comply in other ways so and then just
 
04:58:34.350 --> 04:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
for a few more technical pieces I'll
 
04:58:37.628 --> 04:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
turn it to attorney fry oh
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
sorry are you are are you saying that
 
04:58:45.390 --> 04:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary concerns that have been
 
04:58:47.350 --> 04:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
expressed are already covered in
 
04:58:50.310 --> 04:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
existing law that attorney fry is about
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
to speak to that so I'm G to turn it
 
04:58:53.830 --> 04:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
over I'll let him answer that that's
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:58:59.470 --> 04:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
right yeah so the um the statute for
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
land surveyors that was being referenced
 
04:59:01.600 --> 04:59:02.548 align:start position:0%
land surveyors that was being referenced
RSA

04:59:02.548 --> 04:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:59:07.270 --> 04:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
310-a colon 70 um it references certain
 
04:59:08.948 --> 04:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
um conduct that's considered
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
um if you look at RSA
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
31012 and you compare the language of
 
04:59:18.430 --> 04:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
that statute to RSA 31012 you will see
 
04:59:21.390 --> 04:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
that um the language if not similar
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
almost nearly mirrors it so um this this
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
the intention of this just like
 
04:59:28.750 --> 04:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said was just to
 
04:59:30.310 --> 04:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
clean that up so that we have one
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
statute and when the Public's trying to
 
04:59:35.230 --> 04:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
Surf through multiple statutes they're
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
only having to look at one as opposed to
 
04:59:43.390 --> 04:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
two um also just to speak to uh I'm just
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to Echo what representative
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire said again but um we do do our
 
04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
best to take into um consideration the
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
expertise of the boards the way that's
 
04:59:54.788 --> 04:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
done as you guys probably heard this
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
morning um is that the board sets the
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
criteria and objective criteria just as
 
05:00:04.350 --> 05:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire was referencing
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
um so that you can have any person make
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
that decision and so that's how we
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
handle that and we've already spoke to
 
05:00:13.470 --> 05:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
the electricians piece I did also want
 
05:00:15.350 --> 05:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
to bring to the committee's attention
 
05:00:18.070 --> 05:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
that I received a communication from New
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.948 --> 05:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
department so they had a proposed
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
amendment um to basically use generic
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
language to describe certain sections I
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
think it's sections 15 and sections 26
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
that deal with Insurance statutes to
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
reference the practice of uh practice in
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so psychologists that
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire and mental
 
05:00:50.350 --> 05:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
health practitioners that practice in
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to ensure that we're
 
05:00:55.548 --> 05:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
capturing in those statutes individuals
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
who are licensed under RSA 310 the uh
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
31017 the reciprocity statute or
 
05:01:01.440 --> 05:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
31017 the reciprocity statute or
endorsement

05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
endorsement
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
statute because currently written it
 
05:01:07.628 --> 05:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
just refers to the statutory schemes of
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
the board so they just want to make sure
 
05:01:12.030 --> 05:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
that we're covering everyone for um
 
05:01:12.040 --> 05:01:13.750 align:start position:0%
that we're covering everyone for um
insurance

05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you very much are there
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee seeing then that was very
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to address those questions that
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
we had from everybody so thank you very
 
05:01:28.390 --> 05:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
much um I'm not seeing any other pink
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
cards so I don't see anybody else that
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%

05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
