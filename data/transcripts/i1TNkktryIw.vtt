representative
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
lir you're recognized to uh to speak to
 
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
your motion um we've actually had quite
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
a bit of discussion about this uh topic
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
and um remote work while it's not a New
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
Concept by any means is it certainly uh
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
exploded with the pandemic um and you
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
know all of the sudden people who were
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
office dwellers became
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
um remote workers and um no thought was
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
given to it um it just happened and
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
um since the pandemic we've all
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
witnessed that a lot of these remote
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
workers remained remote workers um a lot
 
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
of companies decided that uh they didn't
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
want to pay for an office um some of
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
them decided that uh they're getting
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
more productivity out of someone working
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
for home um but uh What uh the sponsor
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill represent McKenzie is uh
 
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
suggested is that you know if you you
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
are working from home that home is a
 
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.990 align:start position:0%
are working from home that home is a
workplace

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I guess the question is um what
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
exactly does that
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
mean um
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
and rep McKenzie made some um uh some
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
attempts he actually work on a couple of
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
U amendments um but in the end I think
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
we really need to pose that question
 
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
what exactly does it mean when your home
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
becomes a
 
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
workplace um I mean one of the posters
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
that is expected to be in all um uh um
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
workplaces is one dealing with toxic
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
materials they all must be inventoried
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
well does that mean someone's got to go
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
through my garage in inventory all of
 
00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
the fertilizers and pesticides and the
 
00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
stuff that is technically in the work
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
workplace um but having nothing to do
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
with my work um
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest I think just we we
 
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
are suggesting that this is worth
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about talking about um and
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
seeing if there is appropriate
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that will um address the
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
complexities and uniqueness of U remote
 
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
work so that's why I'm moved to interim
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
I will tell you representative Sant I
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
got a an email two days ago from someone
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
asking me regarding workers compensation
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
and remote workers and the question was
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
posed do you have to have it posted at
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
someone's home all of the labor
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
department mandated
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
posters you know one would think yes not
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
sure you can force someone to put a
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
poster on their wall for themselves but
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
at least it's something we can
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
at least it's something we can
discuss

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
to that to that point uh I did ask the
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor toh give us an
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
opinion relative to posters uh because
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know as cool as it might be to put
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
posters all over your house um there is
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh it is acceptable um and they they
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
could explain themselves but it is
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable do them electronically or
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of portal where people
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
can have access to so that that would
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
kind of take that um away
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands we have a motion
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%

to say uh the sponsor came and said that
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is already in statute so there's
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
really no reason to have second law to
 
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
motion I think uh I think Mr chairman
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
that the verify system has been
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
controversial um since it was originally
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
established it is riddled with the with
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
problems it has improved somewhat but
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's still riddled with problems and I
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
think the potential of taking somebody
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
out uh because of a problem with the
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
system the potential is there and I
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary uh uh to to
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
move forward with this legislation I
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
would ask to support the
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
you I don't any other hands
 
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.030 align:start position:0%
you I don't any other hands
uh

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
the the two comments that I hear
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
repeatedly about this bill uh number one
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary you can do it now if
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like if you're an employer
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
so have at it uh uh number two another
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
comment that was made by the employer
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
was uh why are you making us through the
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
job of the federal government to verify
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
whether someone is here uh legally to
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
work in the uh in the country or not so
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh thirdly obviously um there's been

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
sets the system up in a tizzy and you
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
can have someone that's clearly uh an
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
American citizen that because of the way
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%

a reject uh

rejection um on their ability to work
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%

week appeal process to try to get that
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
resolved when that person is trying to
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
work and that employer wants to hire
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%

representative avalani to do it we'll
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
let him make his motion then Brian uh
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
can speak about it since it was his bill
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
but that that's the reason I did it so
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
just so you all know all right thank you
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative balani I will defer my
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
time to the chairman of the subcommittee
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
all right represent representative
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
seaworth you recognized thank you Mr
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
chairman as indicated um we met in a
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this and had some
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussions in the end um there
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
was agreement all around that it was
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
prudent to raise um the the limit for
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
this which is the amount of money that
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
an employer can pay
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
directly um to
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
the uh Survivor of a deceased employee
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
um to something that matches what was in
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
law at the time but we did not think it
 
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
was wise to raise it too much because
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
there are dangers you could get into if
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
if too much money is being moved around
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
outside of the the formal process one
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
question that I asked the department to
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
answer which they did was beforehand I
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
didn't understand whether you could only
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
pay directly if the amount of money owed
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
was less Le than
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
$3,000 or if it was more could you pay
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
up up to the $3,000 and then the rest
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
went to probate they reviewed the law
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
and the answer is the second so whatever
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
is owed to an employee if it's requested
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
by the spouse of the deceased for
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
example the employee can issue up to
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
$3,000 or whatever is owed whichever is
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
higher and then the rest um takes place
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
through the the process um
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
I think I will for the rest of it the
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
the chairman joined us in the
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and you made some
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
excellent points about how probate
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually works and what this money means
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of of of the overall process
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
that I found very Illuminating so before
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
I mention those representative buard and
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan were also on the committee if
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
you have any comments represent Sullivan
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
and if you could pass this to the clerk
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
for the folder on I I I do there were
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
ever areas of anxiety that uh we
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
uncovered during the the lengthy
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
discussion um and um you
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
know there were to some degree
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
alleviated by the fact that um U the the
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
current language of the of the statute
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
says that um an employer May pay to the
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
Survivor um but doesn't have to um and
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
would would paid to the Survivor if a
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
proper notice is um given so if there's
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
no notice they don't pay if they don't
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
want to they don't pay um so and and
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
frankly in talking about going through
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
the um uh the statute on um figuring out
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
who gets the money um if it goes beyond
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
the spouse or the kids it get it can get
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
really complicated and if it goes beyond
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
the spouse of the kids they probably
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
need a lawyer to figure it out um and
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
they might pay more than $3,000 to get
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
the uh answer so the fact that it's it's
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
a May was uh um comforting because if it
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
hadn't been a May inclusion um but I'm
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
sure that some employers will want to do
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
this because they care about the uh the
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
folks who have been left by an employee
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
who passed um but uh my advice would be
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
be very careful if it's anything other
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
than the spouse of the kids because um
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
you might give the money to the wrong
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
person I mean worse comes to worse they
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
they they'll pay $3,000 to somebody and
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
then pay the $3,000 again to somebody
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
else um because they paid the wrong
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
person um but um the uh three $300 was
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
rid ridiculous um
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
$3,000 is not too excessive I think if
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
the number were much higher we would
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
have been uncomfortable which is why we
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
just left it with what representative
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
seaworth initially um proposed um but um
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
certainly we wouldn't want it a whole
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
lot higher than that just in case the
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
wrong people get paid so um but I think
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
I think as it is um I can certainly
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
support the a to
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
pass bushard thank you Mr chair uh I
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't have anything else to add to it so
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
I I do support what we agreed
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
upon unfortunately I've been the
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
executive two Estates um and the
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
the realistically you know this bill was
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh the this law was first enacted in
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
1963 um and it was $300 which was
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
probably an appropriate amount at the
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
time what really happens when someone
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
dies unfortunately is um someone that
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of extra money
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
hanging around they could utilize that
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
paycheck if that individual was deceased
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
because the cost of a
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
burial the cost of getting an attorney
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
if you have to because in the state of
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know you have to uh
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
submit something to probate you have to
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
pay a probate fee you have to wait for
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
the judge um you have to get a bond uh
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
because of the Fairbanks
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
situation people don't know that 25
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
years ago a judge in the western part of
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state took off a lot of people's
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
money and so now every judge puts a
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
minimum Bond of $33,000 in place because
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
it's a $100 cost for a bond so uh these
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
are things that happen when someone dies
 
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.710 align:start position:0%
are things that happen when someone dies
and

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
um when one of the concerns was well
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
$3,000 what if there's
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
heirs you know why you give it to maybe
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
a spouse if there's heirs down the line
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
they only going to get some money well
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
realistically by the time you um um
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
provide burial services that's the first
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
number one thing in Probate in in
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
the the rules of who gets what first
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
first is
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
burial then it's the
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
lawyers um then it's the federal
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
government and taxes and then it's
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
secured creditors unsecured creditors
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
and then maybe
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
bequests to to spouses or relatives or
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
to children or other relatives so that
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
$33,000 is probably not going to get
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
there um to cause that problem um but it
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
is very important to some that really
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
need it um when life is chaotic and
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
someone

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative sorry thank you Mr Mr CH
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
I plan to support the OTP motion I just
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
want to point out that this bill would
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
be unnecessary if we were using hard
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
money rather than
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
Fiat noted representative Clair yeah I
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
also uh will probably votee for the OTP
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
just wondering um not know if it's a
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
question or a statement more but um I
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
understand how the increase works from
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
300 to 3,000 over the years and just
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
wondering why um like minimum wage
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the same look
 
00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:29.789 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the same look
thank

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
Drago represent alalani your thank you
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I will defer my time to the
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
sponsor um is moved by
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.549 --> 00:25:57.559 align:start position:0%
Drago of grer you're recognized to speak
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
to your motion thank you Mr chair so
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment just makes it impossible
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
to uh read it in such a way that would
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
make it mandatory uh needs to be uh
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary and recorded as such in
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
writing by both the employee and the
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
employer uh this solves a lot of
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
problems so for instance Municipal and
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
County government they just don't have
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
to do it if they don't want to anybody
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
who doesn't want to get paid in gold and
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
silver will not be forced to be paid in
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
gold and silver and um also there was
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
some concern about the order uh the
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
reason that it was put in B was uh
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
because there was uh uh belief that if
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
it is on the last uh on of the menu then
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
some of the prior ones would affect it
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
in some way so U speaking to the people
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
who had that concern putting it at B
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
seems nice because we don't want to put
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
it on a that seems like it's defaulting
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
to Gold and Silver and if we put it B
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's in the middle and so it gets rid of
 
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
it's in the middle and so it gets rid of
that

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan with all due respect I I just
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
frankly think this uh bill is a bad idea
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
and um since the bill fundamentally is a
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
bad idea I'm not going to support an
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
effort to make a a bad idea less bad so
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
amendment Aran hains Phils thanks Mr
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
chair I just I wanted to draw attention
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
to the subsection B on line 9 and 10
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that I think it's unclear whether or not
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
this is a one-time agreement or it could
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
be in perpetuity and I think that that
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
lack of U Clarity causes vagueness which
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
may cause that sentence to be stricken
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
from law when it's legally interpreted
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
if that should ever come up and I think
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is a an important concept
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
to Think Through um before passing um
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
the actual language that it stands so
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
for that reason I will be objecting to
 
00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:03.070 align:start position:0%
for that reason I will be objecting to
the

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
amendment uh any other
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
comments you know originally when uh I I
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
first received the bill
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
um I looked at it and and and thought in
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
my mind that that
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
was wasn't really necessary and and um
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
then I I having reviewed the motion you
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that comes down
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
to some of the things we do here in the
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee um has to do with enabling
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
legislation and um if if two consenting
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
individuals on a contract want to engage
 
00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:39.630 align:start position:0%
individuals on a contract want to engage
in

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.590 align:start position:0%
in
something

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
um the question I always have to myself
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
is why do I think I need to step in the
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
way and
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
and say it shouldn't
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
happen if there's no ability for anyone
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
to force an employer to do it if there's
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
no ability for the employee to force the
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
employer to do it and if I'm am
 
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.310 align:start position:0%
employer to do it and if I'm am
realistic

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
to even though my 60-year-old brain
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't wrap my head around it very much
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to bitcoin and all this
 
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
other stuff that goes on um you know
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
that that is you know going to be next
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
um in line of utilizing other mechanisms
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know when again I can't wrap my head
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
around someone buying a painting online
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
because it has a what do you call it
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
Andrew you were laughing what do you
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
call that
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
stuff whatever you know what I'm talking
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
about aft yeah I still don't wrap my
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
head around that
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
one thank you so uh but they are they do
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
exist uh I don't see any harm in this
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
although I respectfully think it's kind
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
of goofy I don't see that we've done
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
anything to harm either the employer or
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh don't disrespect anyone else who
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
disagrees with me but that's where I
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know where the
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
chairman was coming
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
from so we have uh a motion on the floor
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass the
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm sorry the amendment was on
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
the floor my apologies thank
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
you um moving you want to raise I'll
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
make it quick since we are voting on the
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um I I understand the concerns
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
of my fellow committee members but I
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
think it's very important that we not
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
Advance the original bill um that what
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
we do bring forward for discussion
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
purposes has the correction that has
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
been made for the reasons we discuss
 
00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:45.549 align:start position:0%
been made for the reasons we discuss
thank

00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%

chair sh is is there anything in current
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
law that prohibits an employer an
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
employee from agreeing to payment in
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
gold and silver and platinum and

that representative Granger thank you Mr

chair so the fact that it isn't in this
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
list uh this is a this is a white list
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
not a black list and so if since we have
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
a white list of legal ways to pay people
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
for their bi-weekly or weekly wages then
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
yes the fact that it's not on this list
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
legal

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if there's no further
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm waiting for a motion from
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
one representative Granger I move OTP on
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
Bill original Bill moves ought to pass
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
on the original
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
bill I need a
 
00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:15.509 align:start position:0%
bill I need a
second

00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
Drago you're off uh you're recognize to
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
um so the amendment that I brought up
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
was to clarify the bill but it doesn't
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change the bill um
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
whenever you make a contract with people
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh you can write down in in the contract
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
how you plan to pay people the original
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill without this amendment does
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing it just
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't stipulate that it must be in
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
writing uh the concerns that were
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
brought up that it needs to be in a
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
specific order uh were not based on
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
anything uh real it's a list of menu
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
options it's sort of like if you go to
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
McDonald's you can get a burger you can
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
get fries you can get a milkshake the
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
fact that you're getting a milkshake
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you automatically get
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
fries so anything that is listed as
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
another letter item uh doesn't affect
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
the actual bill um it's a we live in a
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
state where employment is voluntary um
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
therefore this amendment is entirely
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um although I brought it up
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
because I thought it would uh help
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
appease certain concerns uh the original
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
bill is going to accomplish exactly the
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
same thing so I'm going to support the
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
OTP motion on the original
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.230 align:start position:0%
OTP motion on the original
bill

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.589 align:start position:0%
bill
represent

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
seaworth um given my statement just
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
before that previous vote I don't do not
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
think that I can uh my concern and I I
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
don't think I have time to figure it out
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
definitively on the Fly here but my
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
concern was down in subsection e and the
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
references to other sections that that
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
uses and the way the original bill was
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
structured I didn't think they cross
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
reference properly so I'm going to have
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
to um vote no on this motion and uh
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
reiterate my support for the the
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
proposed I see no other comments the
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%

seconded if uh recognize to speak to
 
00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:18.589 align:start position:0%
seconded if uh recognize to speak to
your

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
motion I've made my point I don't think
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh paying in gold and silver is a good
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
idea um paying with a commodity that uh
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
changes value continuously um is uh
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
awkward at the very least and impossible
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
itl repr Granger thank you Mr chair I
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl because doing business in
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
a commodity that changes price
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
frequently is just not very useful and
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh therefore I think we need to switch
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
to gold and silver thank
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.829 align:start position:0%

motion I move
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
itl second chairman motion on the floor
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate by
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative C worth it is seconded by
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative alalani representative
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
seaworth you recognize to speak to your
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you Mr chairman um after
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
we had some lengthy discussions in the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the hearing I had some more
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Department of Labor
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
who sent me some answers I had
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
discussions with the sponsor of the bill
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
and some other groups that had
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and at the end of the day um
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
I think what's clear is the sponsor
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
heard some issues from members of the
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
public that weren't necessarily aligned
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
with the law so the the way she had
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
originally proposed the law it it didn't
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
quite make sense um just in a nutshell
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
there are very different rules for 16
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
and 17 year olds for 14 and 15 year olds
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
and for 12 and 13 year olds and each of
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
those are different and I think a lot of
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
times people coming to this for the
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
first time don't understand the
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
distinction um in a nutshell if you're
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
under 16 the federal law is very
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
explicit and applies and um if you're 16
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
and 17 most of the regulations fall the
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
state law which are very different and I
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
think people get confused sometimes that
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
their 15-year-old runs into a problem
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
and they think they look to the state
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
law and find what we've written for for
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
an older older team so after all that
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
discussion the sponsor agrees with me
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
that um what the bill proposed to do is
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
neither necessary because what she was
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
asking for essentially is state law um
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
or or helpful at this time and if indeed
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
some members of the public do come to us
 
00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:01.670 align:start position:0%
some members of the public do come to us
with

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies uh we'd be happy to look
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
you I see no other hands if any would
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%

to your motion thank you um
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
I think many of
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
us I won't speak for many of us I'll
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
speak for myself
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I happen to believe that this um bill
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
should not have come before us because
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
it is following a very similar Bill
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
almost identical bill from last year um
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
and um and frankly we sh the sponsors
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
should have uh taken a message from the
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
vote last year which I believe was
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
unanimously against the payroll cards um
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
and um I personally feel as strongly
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
this year as I did last year that
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
um the the paper check should still be
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
available as a manner of payment um not
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
many people take them it's not an
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelming burden to do it and frankly
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
I get the sense that this bill is here
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
only because there's a company that's
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
pushing it um so for that reason um I
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
have moved itl and um I also understand
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
that there was a a subcommittee that uh
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
had a lengthy look at uh um a potential
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I not going to speak to
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
that because I was not on that
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um but my understanding is
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
that they came to a four to4 agreement
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
that itl should stand but I would let
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
them speak to
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
that thank you the subcommittee was made
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
up of uh I was avalan uh K Hill Susi and
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
myself so representative alalani since
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
you made the uh uh second the motion you
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
may speak first and then the other two
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um have your comments after
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um Echo
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
representative cvan's um uh comments um
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
as well uh we we defeated this bill
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
silly last year um and it's back again
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
um the problem as an employer um you're
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
making employee now request check um the
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
default payment will be a bank card if
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have their uh Bank information
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're removing written
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
authorization um to allow direct deposit
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and there is one company there isn't
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
just one company that operates payroll
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
cards in the state there are others um
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other ones have fees
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
associated with uh simple items so at
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
93% of the population that does direct
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
deposit um the other 7% could be um
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
forced into these pay cards with these
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
fees and um I don't think that's right
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
also taking away the employer's default
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
to a check if they can't get any
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
information from the employee
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we shouldn't be telling what
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
employers or employees should should or
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
should not be doing in getting their uh
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
pay unless they have written a contract
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
chairman of Susi any representative
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
kahill you're all set you're waving off
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay one of the things I think is very
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.549 align:start position:0%
okay one of the things I think is very
important

00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
what that I had learned over my years
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
here is that we have to think when we
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
make law about every type of uh
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
employee whether they're making minimum
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
wage whether they're
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
making a lot of
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
money and also what kind of businesses
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
we have not everything fits in a nice
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
simple cookie cutter where you work for
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
a grocery store or you work for an
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company or you work for you
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
know an airlin or or whatever you do I
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
don't even know what the heck you do
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
something things um something to do with
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
your computer all the time um so um we
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
have to try to think of everything and
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
how it fits with these and does it fit
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
in and right now the law
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
Works 93% we're told of the people
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
utilize a direct deposit the remaining
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
7% of the 750,000 people employed in
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
this state leaves about 51,000 people
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
that are either getting a check either
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
getting a pay card
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
um pay you know how however whatever
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
agreements they've made
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
um we all have to advance with society
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
and Society is going to pay cards and
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
debit cards and everything else um but I
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
have to think about that person who's
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
working two jobs making you know $10 an
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
hour each one and the fees associated
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
with some of these things and one of the
 
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
Hallmarks of everything that we've
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
learned in this committee is that you
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
earned that that pay you deserve to get
 
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.829 align:start position:0%
earned that that pay you deserve to get
that

00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
pay at a bank convenient to where to
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
where you're working for no cost and
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
that's always been the platform that
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've had here and
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
um If an employer wants to make a deal
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
with their employees to utilize pay
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
cards and maybe pay for some of the fees
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
or provide this now that's still
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
provided the pay card they can still use
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
the pay card and go to a certain Bank
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
get their money um but then there there
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
are some pay
 
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.990 align:start position:0%
are some pay
cards

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
cards
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
that only allow you to take so much so
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to withdraw your
 
00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:05.950 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to withdraw your
entire

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
paycheck from that at one point uh we
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
looked at every single sentence of the
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill and a proposed amendment
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
um tried to work different
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
ways there's things in the bill the ex
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
existing bill which I don't prefer
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
because it places blame on the employee
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
here if the system has a
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
hiccup I don't think it's the employer's
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
problem with the pay card system has a
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
hiccup we all know computer systems have
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
hiccups and anyone lose their cell phone
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
service last week for a certain couple
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
cell phone companies anyone on Facebook
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
I guess yesterday who couldn't couldn't
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.910 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
enough that's enough um
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
so may maybe someday but not the way
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
presented I see I see no other hands the
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
motion of the floor is inexpedient to
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
what is your
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
choice you're all set I'm
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
objection the regular calendar it's on
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
the regular
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
calendar there are no other bills uh
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
before us we have gone through our our
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
list of bills assigned to
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
us I am only aware of one piece of legis
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
ation coming from the Senate at this
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
point there will be more um but I'm not
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
going to um probably pull a a committee
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
to uh hearings together unless we have

questions of the chair any other
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative thank you Mr
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
chairman just for process if we have a
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
small amount of bills would it be able
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
for us to execute them on the same day
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
yes well I'm not a fan of executing
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
bills the same day we hear them
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
especially if there's something that
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
comes up which we all know that someone
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
says something afterwards we learn
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
something or what have you depending on
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
how they come through I'll make that
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
decision usually with the um
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan to to see
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
whether we do that I I I know want I
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know if we have four
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
bills and if they're really simple they
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
pass through the Senate everyone here is
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
in favor of them I might agree to doing
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I I think the current house
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
rule is that um you can um uh exec on
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
the same day um with agreement between
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
the chair and the ranking member um and
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
I will just share that uh um if if
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's any reason to doubt whether
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
we've had enough uh time to consider in
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
debate I I I won't consent I don't think
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh the chair would suggest we should
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
vote um but uh but basically if if if
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
we've got a a no-brainer bill and we can
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
um exec on the same day after you know
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
carefully considering it um I I
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%

closed you know I didn't want to raise
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
this as a part of our business but the
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
gentleman who spoke on behalf of ADP did
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
not the minority he with the company but
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
leg well it'll be I'm going to tell you
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
what I think their opinion
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
what I think their opinion
is

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
ADP ADP is not owns a majority percent
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
of w but they don't do
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
pay yes but I think they're
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
try what happens if I come up
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
here what happens if I I'm an average JN
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
will I'm not a legislator I come up here
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
and speak about an insurance bill
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
because I have knowledge I'm just a
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
member of my association should I have a
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
badge on at that point depends in this
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.559 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
