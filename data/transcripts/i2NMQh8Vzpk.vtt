alignment with federal election law and
 
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
legal precedence the subcommittee will
 
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
consider historical context and
 
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities to clarify current
 
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
regulations the subcommittee will issue
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
a report to summarize its findings
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the ass signed house
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
bills were listed in the February 20th
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
public notice for the subcommittee work
 
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 align:start position:0%
session they're basically the same as um
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
last week with the one bill that we
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
executed um being
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
removed um and there will be some
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
additional bills likely coming in the
 
00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
future weeks as the primary election law
 
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
hears the different uh bills and is uh
 
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.789 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so and in keeping with our
 
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 align:start position:0%
practice if any if the subcommittee
 
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 align:start position:0%
determines that any of the bills under
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
our consideration can be promptly
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
returned to the election law committee
 
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
we will uh do so um again uh some
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of this the subcommittee report
 
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
will be due out of the committee on
 
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
Friday March 14th and that date will
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
likely be the subcommittee's final
 
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.270 align:start position:0%
likely be the subcommittee's final
working

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 align:start position:0%
session uh for scheduling purposes I'd
 
00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 align:start position:0%
like to ask each subcommittee member to
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
hold open Fridays from 9:30 to 12:30 uh
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
excluding next Friday um which is school
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
vacation week and we may have some
 
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
additional working sessions in March so
 
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
that the report can be ready by its due
 
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.870 align:start position:0%
that the report can be ready by its due
date

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
um so at this point
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to
 
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
so um there was some plans to listen to
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of bills uh in particular
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lane who is on the
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh was going to go over
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh
 
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
385 um unfortunately uh at the last
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
minute representative Lane was called
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
away on County delegation duties and so
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
will not be able to join us until later
 
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
in the uh working session and so we will
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
um adjust accordingly uh one of my
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
favorite sayings is blessed are the
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
flexible they will not be broken and I
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
will apply that this morning so uh one
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
of the things that uh we're considering
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the mission statement is uh legal
 
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
precedence and I think there's uh
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
possibly two main ones that
 
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.749 align:start position:0%
possibly two main ones that
are

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
um are germine to what we're looking
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
well there's there's a lot of them
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
obviously but um and election law always
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
litigated um uh but the two that I I
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
think I that are uh maybe perhaps most
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
current and most interesting to us uh uh
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
are the 2018 opinion from the New
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court Supreme Court of
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then the uh
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
2020 case of uh Caroline Casey versus
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Secretary of State um
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
there were in in my and I'm not a lawyer
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
so so I apologize to the lawyers who are
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
present in this room uh so uh but I will
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
I will go over this in my kind of humble
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
way and try to explain as I understand
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
it basically there are two questions
 
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh New Hampshire House of
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives and the
 
00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.749 align:start position:0%
Representatives and the
Senate

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
uh uh through the governor and the
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
executive Council requested the judges
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
give their opinions on um a couple of
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
following questions from the law
 
00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.510 align:start position:0%
following questions from the law
and

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and those are those two questions
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
for whoever might be listening to this
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh by subjecting the first question is
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
by subjecting those who are domiciled in
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for voting purposes to the
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
same Le legal requirements as those for
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
residents in New Hampshire including but
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
not limited to the requirements to take
 
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
actions required by rsas
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
26145 and
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
26335 and to pay any fee which our uh uh
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license um and to pay any fees
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
or taxes associated therewith with House
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
Bill 1264 on its face folate any of the
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
following provisions of the New
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or United States constitutions
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
they ask about the equal protection
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
Clause the voting uh article in the New
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and the equal uh
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
equal protection
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
Clause um in the
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal uh
 
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 align:start position:0%

Constitution um
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
and then the second so and then to to my
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
understanding they their initial
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
opinions are that these do
 
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:19.029 align:start position:0%
opinions are that these do
not

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
um uh necessarily violate any of those
 
00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
those uh clauses I can be corrected
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
later as necessary but U then by subject
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
the second question is by subjecting
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
those who are doin soled in New
 
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880 align:start position:0%

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
claims New Hampshire as their domicile
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
for voting purposes but do not but who
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
do not claim New Hampshire as their
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
residents violate any of the following
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of the New Hampshire or
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution and again
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
they talk about the equal protection
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
Clause under part one Article 2 of the
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one article 11 of the
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution and then the
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
equal protection Clause under the 14th
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the United States
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution and
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
um again in in reading this um it it
 
00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.790 align:start position:0%
um again in in reading this um it it
appears

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
appears
 
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.509 align:start position:0%
appears
that

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
um so it says
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
um interestingly enough uh I won't
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
summarize the pages and Pages uh that
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
are in between but
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
um they uh respectfully asked to be
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
excused from answering the first
 
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
excused from answering the first
question

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh they go on to say um and and
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
ostensibly because there was without
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
there was no developed factual record um
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
and then they say they're unable to
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
answer the second question as well so um
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
that that but they've G gone through a
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
lot of different discussions about uh
 
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
pertinent law and legal precedence then
 
00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
pertinent law and legal precedence then
um

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
in uh 2019 there was a case filed By
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
Carolyn Casey against the New Hampshire
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
State and
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
um uh fortunately we have uh to to our
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh pleasure uh Mr Clement totz from the
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
ACLU who actually spoke for the oral
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
arguments on behalf of the uh plaintiffs
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
I believe correct is that correct and um
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
and so this this particular case had uh
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
five questions that they were trying to
 
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.269 align:start position:0%
five questions that they were trying to
address

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
and and
so

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
uh uh just to give a uh macro view first
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
they they answer the first they answer
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
four of the five
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
questions um in the affirmative and then
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
they uh decline or
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh exercise discretion to decline the
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
answer to question
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
three and um again because it's
 
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.269 align:start position:0%
three and um again because it's
not

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh quote determinative of the cause then
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
pending in any in the certifying court
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
so it again I um to the best of my
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that means that it at the
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
moment was not uh germine or directly
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
applicable again I'm not a lawyer so I I
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
can be corrected on that later by Mr
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
Clement tot say needed um so just to
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
cover the questions here in this 2020
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
decision um are the definitions of
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
residents resident and residents in RSA
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
216 and 6-a as recently amended
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
effectively the same as a definition of
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
domicile as used in RSA 651
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
such that the one with a New Hampshire
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
dool is necessarily A New Hampshire
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
resident the answer was affirmative for
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the second question was is a
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
student who claims a New Hampshire doile
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
6541 a which is the qualifications for
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
voting necessarily A New Hampshire
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
resident of under RSA 216 as recently
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
amended again that is answered in Casey
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
versus the Secretary of State as
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
affirmative by the Supreme Court of New
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and then in the fourth qu
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
I'll skip the third question since the
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
justices decided uh to decline answering
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
that then the fourth question is
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
relatedly does an individual who claims
 
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire domicile pursuant to
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
voting under RSA
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
6541 Roman numeral 1 or Roman numeral 1-
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
a necessarily establish a Bonafide
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
residency for the purposes of RSA 21 uh
 
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
residency for the purposes of RSA 21 uh
RSA

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
26145 and 26335 which are again um
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
drivers license and motor vehicle
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
registration morning and then um so that
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
was answered in the affirmative and then
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
lastly the fifth question is uh given
 
00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.050 align:start position:0%
the definition of non-resident in 250
 
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.710 align:start position:0%
the definition of non-resident in 250

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
967 uh Roman numeral 1 for the M Motor
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Code are college students who
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
reside in New Hampshire for more than
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
six months in any year required to
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
obtain New Hampshire driver's licenses
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
by RSA
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
263 colon 1 if they wish to drive in the
 
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:20.759 align:start position:0%
state and required by RSA 26140 to
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
register in New Hampshire any Vehicles
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
they keep in the state again this was
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
answered in the
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
affirmative so as as I understand it um
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
and I hope to be corrected by our uh
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues and uh attendees
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
here this morning
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
um you would have uh
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
potentially students or other other
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
other individuals as well who are
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
domiciled who then if they choose to
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
vote inactivate or
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
activate um kind of their residency and
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
then at that point they must comply with
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
the residency requirements in New
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and and one of which is
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
includes the uh driver's license and
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
motor and the other Motor Vehicle
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
Registration they in fact own the
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're driving here um so
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
obviously these uh we want to avoid U
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and and
 
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.629 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and and
exercise

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh as much uh wisdom as we can in
 
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.870 align:start position:0%
uh as much uh wisdom as we can in
creating

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
these uh legislations affecting election
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
law so we're trying to make sure that we
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
properly understand the legal precedence
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
and uh consider them as we go through
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
our list of bills and uh make
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations back to the main
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um welcome uh secretary scandin and uh

uh thank you for coming today and uh
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
also Mr Clement totz from the ACLU
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um we had um in case you
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
missed the earlier uh introduction we
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
had expected to go through a one of the
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
longer bills for an extended period of
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
time but representative Lane is uh uh
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
fulfilling some County delegation duties
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
at the moment and so we'll not be
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
joining us until probably 11 o'clock so
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
um I would be happy to invite um the

secretary uh to comment on on my
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of this so far if if you
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
choose to do so or um if if
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh welcome it's always good

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee uh I didn't
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
hear everything that you were saying but
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know the tail and what I picked up
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
was you're talking about college
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
students and and residency and you know
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the statute should
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
apply independently whether a a person
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
is a college student or not
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
and and but when a person registers to
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire they are claiming
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is their
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
domicile residence and so the the laws
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that apply to Residents then would also
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
apply to college students who choose to
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire the the laws uh
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
and I believe the courts have said
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
clearly that college students do get to
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
make that choice um they
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
can register to vote in the community
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
that they are living in while they're
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
college uh and claim residency there or
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
they can continue to vote from the
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
community that they came from uh before
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
they attended College whether it's in
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire or in some
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
other state
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that distinction is
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
important is that the law should not you
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
know Target college students you know in
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
the in the in the uh
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
um us using the terminology related to
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
residency and
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
domicile you know whether instate
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
tuition is going to be granted and stuff
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
to to Res you know that's that's a
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
separate issue yeah yes thank thank you
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
I I only mentioned the college students
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
in in reference to the definition under
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 1A where specifically
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
talks about college students that's the
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
context so and I wasn't um trying to
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
focus on excluding but M merely
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
mentioning college students in the
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
context of that definition so uh but
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
clarification so I don't know if there's
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee has for
 
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:22.190 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee has for
me

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
so I I think
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
just my understanding is that once
 
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:32.860 align:start position:0%
it does that uh decision
 
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.029 align:start position:0%
it does that uh decision
[Music]

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
to um vote and and which at which point
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh dool and residency kick in is does
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
that occur at the moment uh of
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
registration or does it occur at the
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
moment when a vote is cast I know that
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
te technically a a a person has
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
established their residency or domicile
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
before they register to vote because
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
that is a condition of registration so
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
that that could happen uh the day that a
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
person goes to register to vote uh or
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
there could have been some event prior
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
to that that would uh that would
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
okay uh does the subcommittee have any
 
00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:37.990 align:start position:0%
okay uh does the subcommittee have any
questions

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
moment representative c um thank you for
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just wondering of
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
all the various bills that we have this
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
year uh have you noticed any that deal
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
with other issues
 
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
with other issues
involving

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
involving
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
um um being a
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
students I guess we do have that one
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
people um well I know there's there's
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of bills that have have
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
been filed this year and we're keeping
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
track of them as they come up um but if
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's one that you specifically are
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
interested in I can try and answer
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
questions about that I I was just
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
looking more in general as to what you
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
may have observed in in your in the
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
process of you going through various
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
bills MH whether there was anything that
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
the well again there are a lot of bills
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
that have been filed and you know a lot
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
addressing specific parts of the
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
statute and a lot of them are related to
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the election
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
process and uh I think the committee is
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
doing a good job and and the
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is certainly helpful of
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
trying to consolidate the different
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
ideas that are out there that are
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
similar in nature bringing them together
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and trying to formulate you know a
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
policy uh from those and but I can tell
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
you that um in my office we have been we
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
have been working on uh a lot of things
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we think will bring
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
transparency uh and confidence to the
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
process and but they are going to take
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
some time to accomplish and I I think
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
should try and understand you know what
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
that plan is and and how it will uh
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
benefit the voters of New Hampshire
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
especially those that are concerned
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
about you know things related to
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
technology and you know whether people
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh are appropriately registered and
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to just inserting a bunch
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
of uh uh
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
extraneous pieces of legislation that
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
may impact you know the overall plan of
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get to where I think we need
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
to be and so we're following that and
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know when appropriate we'll speak up
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
and let you know when you know we think
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know some legislation although well
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
intended May conflict with you know the
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you uh thank you for
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
that um if I could I'd also like to just
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
ask um a brief question
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
about absentee ballots um and that that
 
00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:15.070 align:start position:0%
about absentee ballots um and that that
process

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
so when absentee ballots are
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
requested I I know in the in the request
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
form that there's a check mark that says
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
you have to uh prove that or I am a
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
registered voter I mean they acknowledge
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
that the voter registration and so
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
ostensibly um if they're registered all
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
the qualifications have been
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately addressed already in terms
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
of citizenship and all
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
those other
 
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.230 align:start position:0%
those other
aspects

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
aspects
um

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:50.490 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.310 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
are it so the the question is when a
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
do the Abs does the absentee voter have
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
to go through the same sort of
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
identification scrutiny that a election
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
day voter would have to go through in
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
terms of um you know presenting
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
identification or something to that
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
extent um could would you mind
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
bit so the absentee voting process
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
is is a a statute that creates an
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for voters who are
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
qualified to be able to vote by
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
absentee if they meet uh the
 
00:25:46.389 --> 00:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
Constitutional requirements to be able
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
to vote by absentee which is uh whether
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
a person is absent or whether a person
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
disability and then the legislature uh
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
over the years years uh and and more
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
recently have added uh Provisions to
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
that that kind of further identify what
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
absence or disability means and so they
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's a provision in there
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
now that provides for uh if a person is
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh working during the entire time that
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
the polls are open uh which would
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
include caring for children infirm
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
adults um that that's considered a form
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
of absence that prevents the person from
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
getting to the polls and so they can
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
vote by absentee
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
um there's a provision uh in the statute
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
now that allows for uh individuals that
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
are concerned about a severe weather
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
event I think specifically related to
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
snowstorms that if they believe that
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
their uh safety is compromised by you
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
know the storm that's going to be
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
rolling through that that could be
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
considered a form of a
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
disability um that provision was widely
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
used during the pandemic uh when we had
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
a a major Public Health crisis that you
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
know people were concerned about
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
catching a a serious uh disease if they
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
went out in public um and so you know
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
for that time period or that
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
election uh that provision the statute
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
was was expanded I think by Statute and
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
executive order to allow an increase in
 
00:27:35.399 --> 00:27:38.750 align:start position:0%
executive order to allow an increase in
absentee

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
voting with that
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
said um this
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
the the requirements of uh identity
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
related to absentee voting are not the
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
same as um showing up in person and
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
having to show an idea I don't believe
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a requirement at the moment
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
that requires a person to send a copy of
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
a driver's license or something like
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
that with a request for an absentee
 
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.669 align:start position:0%
that with a request for an absentee
ballot

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
historically the
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
voter had to sign a an application for
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot and then once the
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
voter receives the absentee ballot and
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
they they they mark it they put it in uh
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the what we call the inner envelope also
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
known known as an affidavit envelope and
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
they had to sign that and send it back
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
in and and for a while the moderator was
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
required I I think the language is
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
probably still in the statute that said
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
that the the moderator would compare the
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
signatures on the Affidavit of the
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
containing the ballot envelope
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
containing the ballot and the
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
application and if it looked like the
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
signatures were a match then that ballot
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
would be counted uh there was a loss
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
suit uh that challenged that uh by an
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
individual that you know claimed that
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know their signature could vary uh
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
daytoday and and the judge agreed that
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know a person's
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
signature uh did not
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh have to be the same
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
as as on both documents the application
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
and the affidavit
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
envelope and based on that said that you
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
know unless the moderator is you know an
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
expert in handwriting and signature
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
comparison that that could no longer be
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
a reason to
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
disqualify an absentee ballot so as long
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
as the names were the same on the
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
application and the uh affidavit
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
envelope and uh as long as there wasn't
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
a signature that was missing on one of
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
those documents it doesn't matter
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
whether it looks like two different
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
people sign the the document as long as
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
the signature is there uh and it's the
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
same name uh the moderator is required
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
to accept that that ballot so that
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
really was the check that was in place
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
um on you know trying to make sure that
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
um you know the person that requested
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot was the same one
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
that filled it out and set it back uh
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
that is no longer there and so um
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that this that part
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
of the statute needs some work to come
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
up with a process that does give
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
confidence to other voters out there
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
that you know the same people requesting
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
the ballot are the ones that are filling
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
it out and signing
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
it yeah uh yes um thank you I've noticed
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
that just in uh researching this Factor
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
there are several states that do require
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
notary publics and uh public notaries or
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
um and it seems to
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
me that there could be
 
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.750 align:start position:0%
me that there could be
a

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
a a series of of
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
um options you know if you identify
 
00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
yourself to an election a town clerk or
 
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
election official or then you know if
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
you are then a way and cannot do that
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
identification then you have a notary
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
public or as we would have in the uaba
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh for military uh maybe military sign
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
off of some nature I believe that's uh
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
part of the federal things might have to
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
double check that
 
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.190 align:start position:0%
double check that
so

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
um I I agree I think it does
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
it it could use some work because there
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
it it seems as if we have a a um
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
qualification to vote process and then a
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
check-in verification process for an El
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
for an election day uh voter but not
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
quite the equivalent for an
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot in terms of maybe the
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
verification for check-in so that um it
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be good to kind of make those on a
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
as best we can on a Level Playing
 
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.669 align:start position:0%
as best we can on a Level Playing
Field

00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:35.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
so thank yeah thank you for responding
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
to that uh
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
question are there any uh representative
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you thank you for taking
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
my question secretary skanland um do you
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation or have seen other
 
00:32:58.029 --> 00:32:58.039 align:start position:0%
states or
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
anything that may come across that might
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
be a better process to accept and
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
validate absentee ballot
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
voters the answer is I I don't have a
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion at the moment it's certainly
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
something that I'm willing to look into
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
and you know work with you know members
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee on uh to come up with a
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to you know to to to give
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
that confidence um I think being on the
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee you've heard me talk about the
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
tension between between making voting
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
reasonably easy uh but also uh you know
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
having the the procedures in place to
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
give confidence that the people
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
participating uh are qualified is really
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
important you know we can't make it too
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
difficult uh so that
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're creating a situation where
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
qualified people just aren't reasonably
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
able to exercise their right to vote and
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
and absentee voting by its nature uh
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
does contain a block of individuals that
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
you know may have difficulty accessing
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
let's say notaries you know if they're
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
confined to their house or something and
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
and so I think we have to be careful and
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
sensitive to um just making sure that
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the requirements are
 
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.109 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the requirements are
are

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
reasonable um but there should be an
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
expectation on the part of the voter
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
that you know that they should be able
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
to provide that confidence uh that's
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
requested so um you know I don't have a
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
solution uh but I'm I'm happy to work
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
one thank
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr new or represent of new thank you
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
um as you discussed that balance between
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
confidence and ability to vote where do
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
you think we sort of stand on that
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
Continuum currently under current
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
statutes and policies are we in the
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
right place is it sort of diminishing
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
marginal returns if we go one way versus
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
the other or what what's your opinion on
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
that my opinion is that we've been on
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
the side of being uh too easy to vote
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
um and and you know that is reflected in
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know some of the voter Integrity
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
movements and the legislation that you
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
know we've seen to try and pull pull it
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
back in the other direction um you know
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
I think that the
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the bill that passed last
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
year that got rid of the affidavit uh
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
process uh to um to be able to register
 
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
process uh to um to be able to register
to

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
vote is a reflection of that and you
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
know up until that bill passed I mean a
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
person uh and before the the affidavit
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
bill passed before that um a person
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
could walk into the polling place
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
without any documentation and through
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
the use of
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
affidavits uh could have established
 
00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:06.150 align:start position:0%
affidavits uh could have established
their

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications and and and then
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
proceeded to vote uh on Election
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
Day and that's a very easy open process
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
does form the question in some people's
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
minds you know how do I know that those
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
people that just filled out affidavits
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
are actually qualified to vote and that
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that's a very fair question you know
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
any any voter in the state has the right
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
to know who's
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
participating in the election process
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that those individuals are qualified
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
and so when when
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think it's fair that those
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
people question that process of being
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
able to establish everything uh uh by
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
affidavit the legislature and its wisdom
 
00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
affidavit the legislature and its wisdom
is

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
pulled back pretty strongly in a
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
different direction from that um you
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
know I think that that uh that statute
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
as it was passed is very rigid and that
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
there may be people that are
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
impacted uh because they are qualified
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
voters but may not have uh ready access
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
to one of the documents that might be
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
required uh to prove those
 
00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.430 align:start position:0%
required uh to prove those
qualifications

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of court cases that
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
are pending related to that bill
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
passing and
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
I and I think that um there's also some
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
legislation in that I think would temper
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh what passed last year uh a little bit
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
so I think the legislature is going
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
through this process right now where
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're trying to you know pull back on
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
the statute the way it had been um and
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
trying to find what that equilibrium is
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you um that's very helpful
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
for me as a as a new representative here
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it would be your
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
office or the Attorney General's office
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
would be the better party to ask but how
 
00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:18.829 align:start position:0%
would be the better party to ask but how
many

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
voter criminal either fraud or other um
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's an improper voter
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
non-citizen fraudulent ID anything like
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
that how many cases on average a year do
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
state the Attorney General's office is
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
the one that prosecutes those cases but
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
but there
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
are less than a handful every election
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
that they find where there was an
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate voting activity that took
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
place um I have not seen
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
anything uh that they have come up with
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
that is organized or or widespread uh
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
but they they do find isolated instances
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
voting thank you secretary scan for
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh do you have any
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
idea of uh approximately how many people
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
who uh request an absentee ballot
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't have numbers on that I'm just
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking you know is there a way
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
that we could figure that out um I'm not
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
sure but but I will see if I can get
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
some information for you on that okay I
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
was just wondering because I know some
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
people um essentially come in to the
 
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.950 align:start position:0%
people um essentially come in to the
clerk's

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
clerk's
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
office building in a application for
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot get the absentee ballot
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
fill that out turn it in while they're
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
still there at the clerk's office
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
voting and that does happen yes um I
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
think and the laws have changed so much
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
over the last few years that I mean at
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
one time there was a provision in the
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
statute and it may still be there that
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
in that situation would allow the voter
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
to present photo ID uh at the time of uh
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
you know filling out the ballot at the
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and then the clerk would
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
be allowed to put verified voter uh on
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
the envelope so that uh a moderator
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
would know that person had shown an ID
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
process I I would Echo that process I
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
know on in previous years in business
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
travel when I've been anticipating being
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
away during uh election day
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
and uh over overseas and would be unable
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
to vote I I know I've gone into the Town
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
Clerk and have filled out the
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
application or the uh ballot at on that
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
day and and again showed my driver's
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
license in that case um and
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
would would you know
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
offhand uh
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for numbers that are probably
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
impossible to remember so I apologize
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
but um approximately how many absentee
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
ballot applications come through the
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office versus
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
local um towns or city
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
Wards I would say almost all of them go
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
directly to the local town clerk that's
 
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.589 align:start position:0%
directly to the local town clerk that's
the

00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
process I
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of anything in statute
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
that would uh that
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
would require the Secretary of State to
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
receive an absentee ballot application
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
from a voter if it does happen it's
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
probably just confusion on the part of
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
the voter about where to send it and if
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
we receive if if we were to receive an
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
application in our office for a town we
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
would simply forward it to the town
 
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.950 align:start position:0%
would simply forward it to the town
clerk

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
you um are there any additional
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I'll be around for a
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
little bit if you have more we we do
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I'm sure um uh
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary Hennessy last week
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
popped up several times so we we
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate your patience with us and
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
your ability to stick around as it were
 
00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:59.430 align:start position:0%
your ability to stick around as it were
um

00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
Mr Clement totz would you like to
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh come up and testify on some of the
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
topics that you've heard discussed this
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
morning I'd be happy to my name is Henry
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
clemento I'm the deputy legal director
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the ACU of New Hampshire it's nice to
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
see you all um I thought what I would do
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
is start by talking a little bit about
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
the residency and domicile distinction
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
that you talked about and then the
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
signature mismatching which my office
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
was also involved in and then talk talk
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
sort of at the end more broadly about
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
other constitutional considerations that
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the committee might want to think about
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee and I'm happy to be
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
dragged off topic or answer any
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions at any time um I'm here to I'm
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
here to help um so
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
initially I think there's been a lot of
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
confusion in New Hampshire over the
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
years about the terms residence and
 
00:43:57.309 --> 00:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
domicile um the Constitution used uses
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
the word inhabitant as to who's entitled
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
to vote and at some point the
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
legislature in statute defined doile
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
when basically every other state used
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
the word resident and I think I can
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
probably speak for everyone in the room
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
when I say I wish that hadn't happened
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
because it just unnecessarily caused
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
confusion and um so for a
 
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
time uh the definitions of domicile and
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
residents were in statute were different
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
and they still use different words and
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
in fact there's many definitions of
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
resident in the New Hampshire statutes
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's 216 which is the general
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
definition there's a separate definition
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
in DMV there's one in the New Hampshire
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics act I had to go through all
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
of this when we were doing um our case
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh but but they're generally very
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
similar but there may be a word or two
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's different and so in 2018
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature as you pointed out was
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
considering hb1
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
1264 which would have removed and and
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
prior to that the key distinction
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
between domicile and residence was that
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
residency required an intent to remain
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
in the state indefinitely and doile did
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
not and the legislature was considering
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
removing that and the governor and
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
Council asked for an advisory opinion as
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
he pointed out from the New Hampshire
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as to whether that was
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional the court in a 3-2
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
opinion said it was but opinion of the
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
justices cases like that these advisory
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
opinions are not considered binding
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
precedent in the way that other cases
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
are because as the court itself has
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledged it doesn't have a factual
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
record before it and so they've
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
described it as they're not sitting as a
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
court they're rather sitting as advisers
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
to a co-equal branch of government and
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
so well it shows the Court's thinking on
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't definitively resolve the
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
issue so so that happened the court
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
returned its answer the governor signed
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and on behalf of two delightful
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
young women we challenged the the bill
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
in federal court um ultimately what
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
proceeded in that Federal litigation was
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
I think people realized and and the
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
federal judge realized that there was
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
some actually a lot of confusion over
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
whether in fact now that the intent
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
remain def indefinitely piece had been
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
removed um the doile and residents in
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
fact mean the same thing did they cover
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
the same group of people in other words
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
because it turns out if you go through
 
00:46:24.359 --> 00:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
because it turns out if you go through
the

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislative op I'll call it a Thicket of
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
residents and non-residents in the DMV
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
statutes it's pretty confusing and I
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually had to consult a
 
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
linguist um at Dartmouth to help me
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what part of speech the word
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
as was in one of the statutes because it
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
turns out it can be like five parts of
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
speech so um ultimately in Casey versus
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
flare so so the federal court certified
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
that to the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
and said in essence do residents in
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
doile now mean the same thing and if you
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire do you now have to
 
00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.470 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire do you now have to
domesticate

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
domesticate
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
your car registration and license and
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
what the court said was
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes um with one I think important
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
asteris that I think Bears on the
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
discussion from last week that I was
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
able to listen to a little bit which is
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
that you're only required if you vote in
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to get a New Hampshire
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license if you drive in the
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
state and so there is a category of
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
people or there may be who are licensed
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
drivers and were licensed in another
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
state who then moved to New Hampshire
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
and register to vote here but for
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason don't drive either they
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't bring a car with them because
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
they're attending school or they're
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
elderly and don't feel safe driving or
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
they you know live in downtown Portsmith
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
and don't need to drive and so for those
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
people they're under no obligation to
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
domesticate their driver's license
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not acting as licensed
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
drivers everyone else has 60 days from
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
when they establish do missiles SL
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
residents to domesticate their driver's
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
license and if they don't they're
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
subject on a first offense to a $60
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
moving vehicle fine and the way that
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
this is considered by the statutes is
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
that that's it's it's not a crime it's a
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
violation but it's a it's a roadway
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
violation it's not an election law
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
violation because it's not that you are
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
an unregistered voter or an unqualified
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
voter it's simply that you didn't update
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
your license as is required by DMV rules
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
I think the fine escalates to over $100
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
for second events I think it's probably
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
rarely enforced but the way I could
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
Envision it doing being enforced at this
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
juncture is someone gets pulled over
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
they present an outof state ID the
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
police officer asked them do you vote in
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
town yes when did you registered a vote
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
and they and they say and it was more
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
than 60 days ago now the police officer
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
probably has probable cause to write
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
them that ticket so that's how I think
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
this they'd have to have committed
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
another driving offense to get pulled
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
over in the first place but I I think
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's how this could go down the other
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
important thing to remember is that
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
there are people who in New Hampshire
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
who drive cars that are not their own uh
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
and you're not under any obligation to
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
register someone else's car on the state
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
obviously in fact you can't because you
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
don't own it so for a while when I was a
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
younger man I my parents own my car and
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
so I would not be able to register it
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere else because it's not my car
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
and so there are people who come to the
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
state with their parents' cars or a
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
family members car and so they're not
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
under any obligation to to register it
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
it turns out and this was uncovered in
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
the casy case that there's actually
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
another category of people which is
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
people who are not registered not
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire and not
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
domiciled in New Hampshire but still
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
spend six months out of the Year here or
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
more they are not qualified to vote but
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
are nonetheless re required to
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
domesticate their car registration which
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
is sort of an interesting wrinkle that I
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
didn't think about and that's I don't
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
know who that is I guess snowbirds Maybe
 
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.309 align:start position:0%
know who that is I guess snowbirds Maybe
Who

00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
Who
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
consider their civic home to be in
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
Florida but have a car I don't know
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
people who fly back and forth may not
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
take their cars and so they have to
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
register the car in New Hampshire even
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
if they're not qualified to vote here so
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
that's sort of an interesting thing and
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think it points out that actually
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why DMV res you know
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and voting requirements are
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
not quite the same because you may have
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
two homes and you may have two cars and
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
they may be in different places those
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
people are only allowed to vote once but
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
if they have two cars they may have to
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
register them and different places
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're still only allowed one driver's
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
license but it's not quite as simple as
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
it may appear on first blush would it
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
have made everyone's life easier I think
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
if in the beginning the legislature had
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
simply said residency and doile are the
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
same probably but that's now happened
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
they used different terms in the statute
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
but the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
said that they're the same so that's
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
sort of the the residency in doile piece
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
one other fun fact about this case is
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
that one of the people who I represent
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
in Caroline Casey who's absolutely
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful got so much out of this
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
experience she went to law school and is
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
now a three at Harvard which I think is
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
really fun um so some good comes out of
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
these cases even if it causes headaches
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
for all involved um on the signature
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
mismatching piece so that the secretary
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
talked about that's a case called CEO
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
versus Garder which my office did
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
before um I joined but I can talk a
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
little bit about it and so
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately as the secretary said there
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
there's a process in statute where the
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
moderator looks at the signature on the
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form and they
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
look at the signature on the affidavit
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
envelope that goes in between the
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot and the mailing
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
envelope and they compare them and the
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
court enjoined that for a couple reasons
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then there were some other reasons
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
that we Advanced that the court found it
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
didn't need to reach number one people
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
weren't being given sufficient notice
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
that this was going to happen or most
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
importantly an opportunity to cure so
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
because could you repeat the last an
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to cure cure oh thank you
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
yes so um at the time and I I can't
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
remember honestly where we are on
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
pre-processing but AB absentee ballots
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
are processed on Election Day and so if
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
the moderator had determined that the
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
signatures didn't match there was no
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contact the voter and say
 
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:23.559 align:start position:0%
hey we're rejecting your ballot for this
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
reason and if there had been maybe the
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
voter would be able to come in and say
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
no no no that that was my ballot uh the
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
the other part is that there was
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
um really very little guidance given to
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
the moderators on how to do this and so
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
it was being applied unevenly across the
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
state and so you had some precincts
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
where like 5% of absentee ballots were
 
00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
being rejected and some precincts where
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
it was zero and it was sort of luck of
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
the draw on who the moderator was in
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
terms of how strict they were on
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
signatures or what they thought their
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
role was in the process and so it
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
created this uneven enforcement problem
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
which is the type of thing that was was
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
ruled unconstitutional in Bush versus
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
Gore and then the third issue that the
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
secretary said is that um moderators are
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
just simply not handwriting analysis
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
experts and there's some discussion
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
interestingly I I was told that the
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
judge from the bench when she was
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicating this case pointed out that
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
she's ambidextrous and could sign with
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
both hands and her signatures might look
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
different and the voters weren't told
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
that their signatures had to match um
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
also people who were were talking of
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
course about absentee voters and that
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
includes a large segment of people with
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities including writing
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities and you were allowed under
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
the statute to have somebody sign for
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
you if you couldn't and there was
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
no way for the voter to know that that
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
person assisting them with the signature
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
needed to be the same person so like if
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
you couldn't sign it and you asked your
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
son to to sign for you on one form and
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
your daughter to sign for you on the
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
other the signatures aren't going to
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
match you didn't know that there was any
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
reason why that needed to happen and so
 
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
your ballot is going to be discarded so
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the reason why the
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
signature mismatching case wasn't joined
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'll point out that the the state did
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
not appeal that
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
decision um then sort of to to your
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
question representative weary Mr
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
chairman about um the identity
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
verification process for uh
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots it I believe that
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
secretary is right that it it isn't the
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
same process that an in-person voter has
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
but I would point out that if a person
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
had their vote stolen by an absentee
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
vote we would know so say I say somebody
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
pretended to be me I'm gonna pick on Mr
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh because I know him please do
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the subit yes so so say Mr
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
O'Brien for some reason decided that he
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to impersonate me and steal my
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
vote and he sent an absentee ballot
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
request and he said my name is Henry
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
Clement hoage I live at 244 Marcy Street
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
in ports New Hampshire do your yeah I
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't care I'm out there um uh my
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
address is public record on the
 
00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:10.549 align:start position:0%
address is public record on the
checklist

00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
um uh and and got that absentee ballot
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
filled it out and nailed it back number
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
one he's be committing a crime several
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
crimes felonies that would disqualify
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
him from voting in New Hampshire forever
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution and could lead to
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
him going to prison but in addition when
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
I then showed up to vote later that day
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
I'd already be checked off and I would
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
know and so we would know that this was
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
happening because you'd have a bunch of
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
irate people or some irate people
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
saying why am I checked off on the
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
checklist as noted as voting absentee I
 
00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:44.839 align:start position:0%
didn't vote absentee but that hasn't
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
happened so we know that this isn't that
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
type of big problem because we're not
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
seeing that um and this is like a nice
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
transition to talk about the general
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional concerns that this
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
committee probably wants to think about
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
about so there's a lot of different
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
parts of the Constitution the US
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the State Constitution
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
that govern the voting process so in CEO
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
which is the signature mismatching case
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
that was ultimately an equal protection
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
and due process challenge which is BR
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
broader than the Voting Rights realm
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's just you can't Target specific
 
00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
classes of people and you have to give
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity to prove
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
themselves and secure government rights
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
including voting but there's also a
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
specific framework that talks about how
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
court evaluate voting laws called the
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
Anderson bdick framework and it's a say
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh Anderson berdick Anders oh berdick
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
yes we've seen a reference to that in
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
many of the court cases sure so there's
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
two cases yep US Supreme Court cases
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
that together establish this framework
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
and basically it's a sliding scale and
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to try to summarize it
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
for you um where the court first looks
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
at the type of Burden imposed on the
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
right to vote and there's a spectrum
 
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.750 align:start position:0%
right to vote and there's a spectrum
from

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh a reasonable and non-discriminatory
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
burden all the way up to a severe or
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
discriminatory burden and then depending
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
on how intense the burden is the state's
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
interest to justify it changes from
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
something close to rational basis review
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
which is it just is there a reason to do
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
it and does it plausibly make sense all
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
the way up to strict scrutiny which is
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
is there a compelling State interest
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
than is the law narrowly tailored to
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
address it and so that's the type of
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
framework that courts use when add
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
addressing these challenges and so in
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
the context of requiring say a notary
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
for absentee ballots one of the things
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
that the court is going to look at is to
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
say okay well the group of people who
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
are impacted by this we know as the
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
secretary said are people who are
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
disabled and may not be able to leave
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
the house may not have access to a
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
notary notaries aren't always free you
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
can go to the I think go to the bank and
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
you know get something notorized but it
 
00:57:52.839 --> 00:57:53.710 align:start position:0%
you know get something notorized but it
costs

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
$5 um uh so so that's the burden how
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
intense is it that would have to be
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
proven by live testimony from you know
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
someone like me would go out and find
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
those people and and ask them and then
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
submit affidavits and say like I I can't
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
leave my house like to get a notary or
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is then it would be
 
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
balanced against the state interests and
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that this people
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
representing Mr scanland would come in
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
and say and I'm I'm sorry it's always
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
you um but that's what the law requires
 
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
you um but that's what the law requires
um

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
is you know what's the what's the state
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
interest what are we trying to do and so
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
number one they'd have to come in and
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
and probably be forced to admit that
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
there's as far as I'm aware no
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
documented cases of absentee ballot
 
00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:41.559 align:start position:0%
fraud in New Hampshire so what's the
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the problem that they're
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
trying to solve how pervasive is it
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
that's a consideration the court would
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
make and then another thing that I think
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
they look at is like does an requiring a
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
notary actually solve the problem um and
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking back and this is a
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
recollection and so it's take it for
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
what it is but um I vaguely recall there
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
was a case
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
of the only affidavit fraud absentee
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
ballot fraud case I can think of
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
involved a person who had requested an
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot like two weeks before an
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
election and then passed and their
 
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
spouse said and I'm using spouse because
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the genders of the
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
people said my spouse had told me they
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to vote for cand at a it was like
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
their last dying wish and they didn't
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
make it and so the spouse filled it out
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
and mailed it
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
back that type of thing where AB an
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot is sent to the right
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
house with the right voter and then
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
filled out by someone else in the
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
household I would surmise would be the
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
most common type of absentee ballot
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
fraud and would not be solved by any of
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
the bills under consideration because
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
you have the real voter requesting the
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
ballot and sending it back
 
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.190 align:start position:0%
ballot and sending it back
it

00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
would but there's there's no matter what
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
you do unless you require people to film
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
themselves filling out the ballot which
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
I think would be unconstitutional for
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
other reasons you're never going to be
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
able to ensure that the person who's
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
requested the ballot and the person who
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
filled out the ballot are exactly the
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
same person if that makes sense and and
 
01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
so I think that infirmity would harm the
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
state's defense of these types of laws
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
because the courts I would argue are
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to exact a pretty
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
significant scrutiny on this given the
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the burdens imposed and
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
figure out is the law proposed does it
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
actually solve the problem and that's
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's just something for the committee
 
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.430 align:start position:0%
that's just something for the committee
to

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.710 align:start position:0%
to
consider

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
um I've spoken a lot I'm happy to take
 
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.390 align:start position:0%
um I've spoken a lot I'm happy to take
any

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you yeah
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
um I I do I do have some questions um if
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
I may uh but
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
um for the purposes of voting those
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
those uh you you mentioned that there
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
were uh individuals who had moved from
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
other states um who chose to no longer
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
Drive uh or were uh infirm or for
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
whatever reason no longer chose
 
01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:24.109 align:start position:0%
whatever reason no longer chose
to

01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh act on their driving privileges or
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
capabilities what
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that in some cases we
 
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.710 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that in some cases we
certainly

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
recognize in statute that if a person
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
is here in New Hampshire and has a
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license and they're over a
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
certain age I think we're we're actually
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
trying to change that to 75 now because
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
65 is of course way too young um my
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
parents would agree with you what what's
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
that my parents would agree with well
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
and and um uh uh the chair is also over
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
65 so um um I still think of myself as
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
young even if not everyone does um and
 
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.269 align:start position:0%
young even if not everyone does um and
so

01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
if in those circumstances
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
where uh they have a an old driver's
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
license from Maine or wherever Florida
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
um and if they were here and
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
voting is it reasonable for New
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to say okay after a certain
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
period of time we expect you to get
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
another identification there are
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
non-driving identifications that are
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
available from New Hampshire
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
so what's your concerns with that so
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question um and I'm
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
just going to sort of spot think at you
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
if that's okay
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
so if you don't drive in New Hampshire
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
you're under no obligation to have a
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
driver's license and in general you're
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
under no obligation to have any photo ID
 
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
at all um if you want to vote you're
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to need I I don't love voter ID I
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a surprise to people
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
but I I think that maybe the ship is
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
sailed on that
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
um so if you're not under any obligation
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
to get a new
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
ID and you move here from so say you
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
renew your main driver license mhm and I
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe it's good for 5 years
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
so then you move to New Hampshire and
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
you decide not to drive well so you've
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
got this main driver's license I don't
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
know whether main Law requires you to
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
notify them that you are no longer a
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
resident there there may be some states
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
that do actually I think New Hampshire
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
is one where if you move out of the
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
state I think you're supposed to tell
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
DMV yes I doubt that happens but um and
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
like surrender your driver's license but
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
but in the
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
scenario say M doesn't require you to
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
not notify them so you've got a photo ID
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's been issued to you you're
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
probably not allowed to renew it in
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
Maine because you don't live there
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
anymore you don't have to get a New
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license because you
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't drive there's no legal obligation
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
for you to get a New Hampshire non-
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
drivers ID and it may be burdensome to
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
do it they're not free and you have to
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
DMV um maybe you have no other reason to
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
do it because the only reason you need
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
your ID is to vote I don't know maybe
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
maybe once your old license expires
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
probably what the law would require you
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
to do if you wanted to continue proving
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
your identity would be to get a
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
new non- drivers ID in New
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when you now need an
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
ID I don't know I I guess I think why
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
should we be requiring people to do that
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
if they're
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
not if the only reason that they're
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
getting an ID is to vote
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
then you're sort of tying now the
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
burdens of getting the non-d drivers ID
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
even more discreetly to the voting
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
process and so that makes it closer to
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
like not a pole tax necessarily but but
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
now you're spending the $50 or whatever
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
it is to get a non- driver's ID solely
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
for the privilege of voting is it
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the state I don't know I
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
mean I think that would be up to a
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
federal judge
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm inclined to say no because
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
because there's no
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
I it's one thing to say you need to
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
present a current ID but to say you have
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
to if you have a driver's license that
 
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.589 align:start position:0%
to if you have a driver's license that
otherwise

01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
counts and it's you're not driving
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
anymore what what's the state's interest
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
in requiring you to get a new ID I guess
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
answer so the the burden
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
of so o overtime
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh people age and and their appearances
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
can change radically even y um and so a
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license that had a fiveyear
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
expiration date that that is now a year
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
past its expiration date y um very well
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
the person could uh May resemble but but
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know not entirely match that
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
identification credentials being
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
provided by you know out of state
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
licenses so that's an interesting
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
question and and I think what I'd say to
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
that is actually if a close reading my
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
my reading of the statute is that when
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
the person checks in to vote and they
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
present the photo id the the ballot
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
clerk is not actually comparing the
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
person's picture to the person I don't
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
think that there's any legal requirement
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
that you look like the picture on your
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
ID you're comparing the name it has to
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
have a photo but people transition
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
genders people grow or shave beard they
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
cut their hair they dye their hair they
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
get glasses as you say they're you know
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
they get in a car accident and become
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know just look
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
different I don't think that there's any
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
obligation and if there were then it
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
would be every time you dye your hair do
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
you have to get a new driver's license I
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
mean that that's I think that sort of
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
shows the problem with that but but
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
right now under New Hampshire law I
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
don't understand New Hampshire law to
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
require anyone to actually verify the
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
picture on the person you're you're
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
presenting an ID with your name on it
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
and the picture and the reason for that
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
is like why would anyone carry around an
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
ID with someone else's name and picture
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
on it and if they do they're committing
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
a whole host of other crimes um if
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're trying to you know do identity
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
fraud but but the picture piece isn't
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
isn't what's there you're right it's not
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
in Statue I think by practice I often
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
observe that the supervisors of the
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
checklist on Election Day are looking at
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
the picture and looking at the person uh
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
quite of
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
I volunteer as a ballot clerk in
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
Portsmith I don't do
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
that you have remarkable discipline what
 
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.029 align:start position:0%
that you have remarkable discipline what
um

01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
so uh all right well so th I think that
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
is an those are some interesting
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
questions that I think the election law
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee should wrestle with and the
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will try and wrestle with
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
um with with regard to the question it's
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
been raised that there's not much of a
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
incident of fraud detected for some of
 
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
incident of fraud detected for some of
this

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
I it's my understanding you know the
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
attorney general has a lot of different
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities not solely being
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
election law and so I'm wondering if the
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
resources um are
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
are sufficient um you we have a few
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
cases you know it's not as if there's an
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
active investigation into
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
every um problem or
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
issue that that is being acknowledged or
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
reported I I think
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to ask them about the
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
their resources and obviously the
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
allocation of government dollars is a is
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
a is a New Hampshire legislative
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
determination to make um I can just say
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
from my experience there is a dedicated
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
election law unit at the Attorney
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
General's office there's an Assistant
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
in charge of it who I hold in very high
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
esteem there's an investigator there who
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
I hold in very high esteem I think this
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
is basically all that they do whether
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
there should be more of them is a
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
decision for you all but but um there
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
are people who do this and they look at
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
it and it's not like it's not like the
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general just is doing this and
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
a million other things they there are
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
there is a dedicated unit and they are
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
but as I said I hold them in high esteem
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
I've litigated against them they're
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
people and I've called them um what what
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
when issues arise right for for
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes yes uh
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement um are there any other
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at this
 
01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:20.870 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at this
point

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question kind of I
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
have a scenario uh we were talking about
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
out of state license so firsttime voter
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um firsttime voter with an out
 
01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.189 align:start position:0%
yeah um firsttime voter with an out
ofate

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
ofate
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
license um appears to
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
the um checkin or uh with
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
a information of one residency where
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
their vehicle is registered yeah and
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
then has
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
another document indicating The
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
Residency which is in a different part
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the same city within New Hampshire I
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
doing this so three different
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
identifications one photo ID driver's
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
license from an outside of state and two
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
separate um pieces of document from two
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
different residency first- time voter so
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
they get a pass basically they can come
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
in and vote with that information is
 
01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.830 align:start position:0%
in and vote with that information is
that

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
correct um so I'm going to quibble with
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
your isation of them getting a pass but
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
I will but yes and and
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so doile and
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
residency the way I think about it is
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
that there's an objective component and
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
a subjective component so you have to
 
01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
have a p physical presence in the state
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's the objective
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
piece and it has to be and I'm I'm
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing for memory but like your
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
primary place for civic and social
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
participation in Democratic
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
self-government and so so I think that
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
there's a mental component to that of
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
like a person has to decide in their
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
head where their Community
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
is and there's a few ways that a person
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
can do it and it has to match up with
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
whatever objective facts there are on
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
the ground so there's no requirement for
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
example that a person spend 60 six
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
months out of the year in New Hampshire
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
or even a majority of their time in New
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it just has to be like where
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
you would do jury duty where you would
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
vote where you would give to local
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
candidates where you would go to the
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
school board meeting those are factors
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
to consider under the current statutes
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
as they exist and and they're being
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
challenged in court there's no more
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits to prove any of your
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications so when this person goes
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
to register to vote they will have to
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
prove to the satisfaction of the
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist that
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're domiciled in the town or Ward
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
that they're registering of v in so that
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
could be with a lease it could be with a
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
utility bill it could be that they
 
01:12:59.229 --> 01:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
appear on a list of people who have a
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
dorm at Dartmouth College in the town of
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
Hanover um or some other document that
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
is to the satisfaction of the
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist but it's
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
not I would say that they're getting a
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
pass it's that
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
they're presenting documentary proof
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
that they live in that town and and I'll
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
say to your point that I I think that
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
probably the most common type of voter
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
fraud and I'm not I haven't done an
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
exhaustive review of this it's sort of
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but I think that the most
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
common type of voter fraud in New
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire probably is double voting and
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
so that probably appears when people
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
have multiple domiciles not multiple
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
domiciles but multiple houses so a
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
person lives in Massachusetts but they
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
have a ski condo in New Hampshire or
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
whatever and they decide that they're
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
going to vote in both places first of
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
all they're going to get caught but but
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
second of all they're not going to get
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
caught because of any of the documentary
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
requirements because they can prove all
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
those things they can say I have a deed
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the ski condo I have proof of
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
residency that the issue is that they're
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
also voting somewhere else and they'll
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
get caught when the checklists are
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately compared
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
so you can require documentary proof to
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
say someone has a connection with a
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
particular place in New Hampshire which
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
is what the legislature has done but I
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how you can ever get someone
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
to prove that they don't have other
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
places or have had other places and it
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
and one other point I'll just make to to
 
01:14:25.719 --> 01:14:27.390 align:start position:0%
and one other point I'll just make to to
to

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
um your scenario is that when you move
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire you're
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
required to update your address with
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
DMV but you're not required to get a new
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
physical driver's license and in fact
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
they're not free so I live in Portsmouth
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
but if I move to Dober I have to tell
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
DMV that I'm moving to do but I don't
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
have to get a new driver's license that
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
says Dober on it and if I did I have to
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
pay like
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
$50 is was that helpful at all yes it is
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
I I have a follow-up though so the same
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
person in the scenario if they go to
 
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
person in the scenario if they go to
vote

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
again with the same credentials they're
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
already logged into the system what then
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
happens so they've already registered so
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
they've already proved to the
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of the supervisors of the
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
checklist their age citizenship identity
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
and domicile they're coming back to the
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
checkin table and they're voting again
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
all they're doing now is proving their
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
identity and so what the law requires is
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
that they present one of the categories
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
of documents that include government
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
issued ID that has both a photograph and
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
their name and that's all that they're
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
proving regardless of where the ID is
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
from which state so they can reuse that
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
ID from they can and and I see where
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
you're going with this and I point out
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
that I think that it's possible given
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
how late our state primary election is
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
that you can actually have two elections
 
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of each other
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
um because you could vote like at
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
September 8th and November 3rd I think
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
are within 60 days so that that can
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
happen if they were to do that I suppose
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
that there there's evidence now that
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
they've committed a DMV violation by not
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
domesticating the driver's license if
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's also proven that they've driven
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
during that period of time and if there
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
were a police officer around who observe
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
this they could probably write them a
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
$60 ticket for failing to update their
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
license but the mere fact that they
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
haven't done
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
that I here's my broader philosophical
 
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
response to you if I may is the mere
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
fact that someone hasn't updated their
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
license doesn't mean that they're not
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
domiciled and living in the state it
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
could just as easily mean that they're
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
scatterbrained or busy or
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
disorganized um I lost my driver's
 
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
license it just just like fell out of my
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
wallet and so I went around with my
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
expired license for like 3 months and
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's just because I have this job and I
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
have a kid and it's like snowing and I
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
just didn't get to it should I have I
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
definitely should have but that doesn't
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
mean that I wasn't qualified to vote in
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I guess I would
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
encourage the subcommittee to think
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
about to hold in their
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
minds that just because someone doesn't
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
do these like bureaucratic steps doesn't
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
mean that they're not actually living in
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I understand that there
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
are competing interest and that people
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
may have philosophical differences about
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
how reasonable it is to impose these
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
burdens on people but I don't know
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
consider your disorganized nephew
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
you any additional U representative new
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um thanks so much for your uh
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
explanation especially on residents in
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
domicile are there issues with
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
citizenship as well yes yes big time
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
could you kind of expand on that a
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
um um there's a there's a rule of
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
professional conduct for lawyers that
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
prevent people from talking about
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
pending litigation with a represented
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
person without their lawyer presence so
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
I can't get too into
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
it um so I'm not going to talk about the
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but what I'll say is that
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire Law requires
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
documentary proof of all of your
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications including age citizenship
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
identity and doile from my perspective
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
citizenship is the hardest qualification
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
to prove with doile with documents
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's no document I'm aware of that
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
proves all four some documents can prove
 
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
three like a driver's license can prove
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
your identity domicile and age but it
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't prove citizenship a passport can
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
prove your age identity and citizenship
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
but not your domicile so so there's no
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
documents that prove all of them the
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
documents I'm aware of that prove
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship are a birth certificate if
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
issued within the United States
 
01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
issued within the United States
naturalization

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
naturalization
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
papers and a
 
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.390 align:start position:0%
papers and a
passport

01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
passport
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
um I think the reason that I'm most
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about this is that I think
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's the type of documentary proof
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
that people are least likely to
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
have um I don't know about the
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
incidences of citizenship fraud or
 
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.270 align:start position:0%
incidences of citizenship fraud or
non-citizens

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
non-citizens
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
participating in our electoral process
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
but I can just say that those
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
requirements are under Court challenges
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
and that there was a 10 circuit case
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
from 2020 where the 10 Circuit Court of
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
Appeals in St Louis maybe struck down a
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
Kansas law that required documentary
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship because they found
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
that something like between 12 and 20%
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
of people who were registering to vote
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
were disqualified because they didn't
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
have documentary proof of citizenship
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
but the state's own expert testified
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
that at least 99% of them were in fact
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there are any bills
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
that are under consideration with the
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that address
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship um but one could easily
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
imagine you know an elderly person who
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
moves from their house into an assisted
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
living facility in a different town or
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
Ward and now has to
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
re-register may not be able to be found
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
on the Statewide voter database and when
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
they re-register now has to prove their
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
citizenship as well even though they've
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
been voting in New Hampshire for 70
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
years and doesn't have an original birth
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
certificate doesn't know where to get
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
one and doesn't have a passport and that
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
person would not be allowed to register
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
so I do think there are cons I yeah big
 
01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.990 align:start position:0%
so I do think there are cons I yeah big
concerns

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
citizenship so the the main concern is
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
really the proof of the citizenship is
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
what yes because citizenship is already
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
established as a legitimate requirement
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
for voting as I understand it yeah
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's other court cases larger than
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about that have
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
established that yeah so there are some
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities outside of New Hampshire
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
that allow non-citizens to vote for
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
some municipal offices so like I I think
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
in Maryland and maybe California there
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
are communities where non-citizens might
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
be able to vote for school board that's
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
not the case in New Hampshire right you
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
have to be a US citizen to vote in New
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm not advocating that
 
01:21:40.679 --> 01:21:44.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm not advocating that
that

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
change maybe it could include us
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
Nationals I don't know I haven't thought
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
but uh okay thank you thank you for that
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
answer um
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just touch on the fraud
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
question just a moment it it seems as
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
you were talking about that that most of
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
the fraud cases are actually people that
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
are the fraud cases that are identified
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
are actually people who are double
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
voting at some level either within New
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Massachusetts in New
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or something like that I think
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's right the Attorney General's
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
office would be more definitive on that
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
because they conduct the investigations
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
and like may have secret investigations
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know about but I think that
 
01:22:25.239 --> 01:22:29.629 align:start position:0%
I don't know about but I think that
that's

01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
right I know there I know at least from
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
the voter I uh Integrity groups often
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
talk about concerns when there has been
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
a municipality or a
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
town of some sort who have had more
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
votes than voters after an election and
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
two uh two communi s that that I'm
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with yeah on that matter um
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
would you care to comment on that or uh
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
I honestly I would I would direct that
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
to the secretary sorry to put you on the
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
spot I don't I don't think that's what's
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
not um I I guess I don't specifically
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
know what you're talking about so I
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
would to someone else that that's a a
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
fair response um and the CTO versus
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
Gardener how how do you spell CEO
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
S no please um um I can pull this up and
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
site um s a u c d o s CE e d o thank you
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
yep versus Garder and
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's our own Bill Gardner correct is
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
that yes yes indeed uh that's a 2018
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
case from the District of New Hampshire
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much yeah we'll
 
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:11.480 align:start position:0%

suppose all right I I uh I don't see any
 
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the subcommittee
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
at this time thank you very much Mr CL

free to reach out to me with any email
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
by questions I'm Henry at aclu.org I'm
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions for the
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
committee's convenience thank you very
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh Mr secretary did you
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
have any follow-up uh comments um after
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that testimony and some of the
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions that the
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had that you'd like to
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
comment on I'd offer you that
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity at this time yeah I don't
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
have any followup comments other than
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know the issue of more votes than
 
01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
voters on the checklist I mean there are
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
reasons why that happens and after every
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
election we kind of go through the
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
return of votes and the moderated
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
reports just to try and you know figure
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
out what those discrepancies are it can
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
be anything
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
from uh counters not understanding
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
when TR I think things like when when
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
the when the ballots go through the
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
ballot counting device and they get
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
kicked out for a right in vote that
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
might be on that ballot sometimes they
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
think that they have to count every race
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
ballot and not just the right in so
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get you know double
 
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
counting um in situations like that and
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
then because we have same day
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
registration and in some elections there
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
are very large numbers of
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
registrant uh the number of votes in
 
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.270 align:start position:0%
registrant uh the number of votes in
that

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
election uh may show very high in
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
relation to the uh number of Voters on
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
the checklist before you know they add
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
those into the process so there there
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
are it's usually human error that causes
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
that and uh you we do our best to clean
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
that up after the
 
01:26:20.119 --> 01:26:21.669 align:start position:0%
that up after the
election

01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
so uh so if if I may uh just uh ask a
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to that so uh because
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
I think that would be very helpful
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
for uh voter Integrity groups or
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
whatever to understand that so uh if
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of same day
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
registrants there's actually sort of a
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
lag time for the checklist to catch up
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
to those additional same day registrant
 
01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
being added onto the checklist there
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
there could be just depending on how the
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
report takes place at the local
 
01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.510 align:start position:0%
report takes place at the local
level

01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
how how long would that how long would
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
you anticipate that lag time to
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
be if if there's a you know if
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're um writing this information in
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
how how quickly should they be updating
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
that back to your office hopefully it's
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
all cleaned up within you know 60 days
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's it it is a large process
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
of uh certifying the returns after the
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
election's over I mean that is done
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
usually within a week but but sometimes
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
there are Corrections that are made by
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
at the local level and that information
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
trickles in sometimes after you know the
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
formal process is complete we do make
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
those adjustments when uh you know when
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
we become aware that an error has been
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
made but but um but those are the types
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
of things that you know cause those uh
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
numbers to
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
um you know be the way they are thank
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
you well that I think that's very
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
um yes represent sorry uh thank you for
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so the uh supervisor
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the checklist do they have a deadline
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
as to when they need to update the
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
firsttime registration voters not first
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
time but yes same day same day
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
registration voters is there you said
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
about 60 days but is there an actual
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
time period they have to have that
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
submitted to you I don't believe there
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
is a hard date in the statute other than
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
they have to have their checklist ready
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
before the next election takes place so
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
in in the case of a town where you have
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
a state general election in
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
November uh they have to have their
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
checklist prepared and ready to go for
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
March local elections so all of that
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done cities may take
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
longer because they most of the Cities
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't have their elections until
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
November really a year after the
 
01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
election process from our perspective
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to get that information
 
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
updated as quickly as possible and you
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
know and we do request that but there is
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
no hard deadline for when they have to
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
done can I have a followup here so would
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
you prefer to have a date that's a hard
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
date within certain time
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
period would that be helpful to the
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
office your
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
office well it would be helpful for the
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
office but but I I am always cognizant
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
of the workload that is on the local
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
election officials and you know I don't
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to sometimes they need pushed but
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
many of them already are working very
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
hard to get those jobs done and and
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're pretty much volunteers so right
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
you know we we want to work with them on
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
you I if I may ask a follow-up question
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
to that it
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
would 90 days after a general election
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
and 60 days after other elections be
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'm just thinking about the
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
large volume of Voters that we have
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
during the November general elections
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
versus typically a a much lower response
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh or turnout um during the local
 
01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:27.790 align:start position:0%
uh or turnout um during the local
elections

01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
be acceptable to the Secretary of
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
State's office I'm sure the municipal
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
Association would have something to say
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
about but
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
um is that the sort of time frame that
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
you might be looking for to have uh
 
01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.310 align:start position:0%
you might be looking for to have uh
checklist

01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
updated instead of having a rigid
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
deadline I I think it would be
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
preferable to work with the supervisors
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
checklist and the clerks just helping
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
helping to support them in that role so
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
that they can get it done as quickly as
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
possible as opposed to because as you
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned you elections are all
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
different local elections lighter
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
turnout State
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
primaries certainly lighter turnout than
 
01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.189 align:start position:0%
primaries certainly lighter turnout than
general

01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
elections and a you know a a general
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
election without president versus one
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
where we're voting you know those are
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
also very different so flexibility I
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
good all right thank thank you for your
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
response appreciate that um just just a
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
quick follow um when you said that they
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
had to get it by the next election would
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
an sb2 deliberative session count as
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
that next election as well yes okay
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
okay um I think I think we're done here
 
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:09.950 align:start position:0%
okay um I think I think we're done here
thank

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
think this has been very helpful to hear
 
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh perspectives uh this morning
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
about the kind of legal precedence and
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
and other concerns with uh both the in
 
01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:35.790 align:start position:0%
and other concerns with uh both the in
both

01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the state interests to have
 
01:32:43.709 --> 01:32:43.719 align:start position:0%
elections that are safe and secure as
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
well as you know the burden imposed on
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
the right to vote so I think those are
 
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
really kind of the balancing factors
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to consider here and
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh really appreciate the testimony from
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office and from
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I think what I'm going to do is just
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
um have the committee take a quick break
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
till maybe
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
11:15 and then we'll
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
resume and uh
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we might have a little Changing
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
of the Guard I know one of our members
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
has to leave for some um other community
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
commitments and we have uh another
 
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative who is going to be coming
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
back after uh County delegation
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
obligations being fulfilled this morning
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
so um we'll resume at uh 11:15 by my
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
watch so that is about 12 minutes from
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.719 --> 01:34:52.629 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%

01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:52.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.040 --> 01:45:21.950 align:start position:0%

01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
break for anyone who might be
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
watching um what I'd like to do
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
is go over some bills um we we sort of
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
go gone over some of the legal
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
precedents this morning looking closely
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
at uh some recent opinions from the
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of New Hampshire
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
and um uh a case that was litigated in
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh 2019 2020 Casey versus the New
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Secretary of State and we
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from the Secretary of
 
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
State's office and from the ACLU this
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
morning regarding different aspects I
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
think um what struck me was really
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
trying to find a balance between the
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
state's interest to have safe and secure
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
elections versus the burden imposed on
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
the right to vote I think that is um
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
the uh key aspects that at this
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee needs to consider at least one
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects that the committee
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
needs to consider is making sure that we
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately balanced want those
 
01:47:54.119 --> 01:47:55.310 align:start position:0%
appropriately balanced want those
aspects

01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.109 align:start position:0%
aspects
now

01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
um I think we have uh last week we
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
discussed bills pertaining to RSA
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
65913 there were uh at least four of
 
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
them that we
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
discussed and we as well
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
as um we worked on one and moved that
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
along because basically it
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
had um while some good ideas it was
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
really addressing the concept of
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
domicile in the wrong area of the
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
RSA uh
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
for now what I'd like to do
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
at um there's a couple of bills
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that there's there's one bill that uh
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
specifically talks to 65412
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
365 let me um so I'd like to just
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.629 --> 01:49:07.639 align:start position:0%
that and then
 
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh representative Lane can
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
come and join us soon and we can go over
 
01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
385 um but this is this is I think
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
Germain because this pertains to the
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship which we just
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
discussed with uh Mr Clement toes from
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
the ACLU so
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
um if I may just discuss this bill
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
briefly um it's a a new paragraph voter
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
identification proof of
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
citizenship and they were uh inserting a
 
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph two um if a person claiming to
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
be qualified to vote is unable to
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
provide reasonable documentation
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
establishing that the person is a
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States um at the
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
request of such person the supervisors
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
of the checklist city or town clerk or
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
authorized election officials shall
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to confirm the citizenship
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
through the office of the Secretary of
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
State and the Secretary of State can
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
then make reasonable efforts to
 
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
determine if they are a US citizen by
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
accessing relevant and available inst
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
State out of state and federal databases
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
that contain such
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
information um however if the request to
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
verify citizen status is made on
 
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.669 align:start position:0%
verify citizen status is made on
Election

01:50:32.669 --> 01:50:32.679 align:start position:0%
Election
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
Day um neither local election officials
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
nor the Secretary of State shall be
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
required to expend such time or effort
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
on citizen verification as would
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonably interfere with other
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
election day duties if the unit if the
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
person's United States citizenship
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship is verified they shall
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
notify the uh the Secretary of State
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
shall notify the local election official
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
and the citizenship criteria for voting
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed satisfied the local
 
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
official shall then note on the person's
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
voter registration application form US
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
citizenship verified and shall indicate
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
on that form the date and the basis on
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
which such verification is made so I
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
think just that's the first part before
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
I continue on with paragraph B I
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
think um that looks to be a fairly
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
clear balance between
 
01:51:30.589 --> 01:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
um trying to meet the state interest for
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
for the qualifications of the voter but
 
01:51:34.079 --> 01:51:35.149 align:start position:0%
for the qualifications of the voter but
wi

01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
wi
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
without imposing an unreasonable burden
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
on the person who has that right to vote
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
perspective the uh then Part B um just
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
continuing on if a person claiming to be
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote asserts that she is
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
unable to do due to indigency to provide
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
documentation to establish that he or
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
she is a United States citizen and if
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to verify the person's
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship pursuant to sub paragraph a
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
successful the city or the town clerk or
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State May request such
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
a person to complete a financial
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit on a form developed for this
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
Purpose By the secretary of state so
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
if a person um does not have the
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
resources or wherewithal to be able to
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
pursue documentation of citizenship then
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
they may make a uh appropriate
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
application and then uh if based on
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
criteria established by the Secretary of
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
State appears that the person qualifies
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
as Indigent the clerk or secretary or
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
the secretary May provide the person
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
with a voucher sufficient to cover the
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
cost for the person to obtain a
 
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
certified copy of the person's birth
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
certificate or other equivalent
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
documentation to establish that status
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
as a United States
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
citizen uh the person shall be
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
specifically informed that is the
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
person's responsibility to communicate
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate Vital Records
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
agency in the state of the person's
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
birth and use the funds provided through
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
the voucher to pay any required fee to
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
obtain the person's birth certificate or
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
equivalent proof of citizenship such
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
documentation shall be provide to the
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
local election officials on before the
 
01:53:25.229 --> 01:53:25.239 align:start position:0%
day of election in order for the person
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the citizenship criteria for
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
voting and then the Secretary of State
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
shall reimburse local municipalities for
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of all vouchers issued by the
 
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
city or town clerks pursuant to the sub
 
01:53:36.599 --> 01:53:38.350 align:start position:0%
city or town clerks pursuant to the sub
paragraph

01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
so um and then the rest of it is
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
concerning financial matters which we
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
will not go into at this uh for this
 
01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.310 align:start position:0%
will not go into at this uh for this
subcommittee

01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
so from that perspective I think that um
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
again is trying to ease what might be
 
01:53:55.709 --> 01:53:55.719 align:start position:0%
perceived as an unreasonable
 
01:53:55.719 --> 01:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
perceived as an unreasonable
burden

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
um imposed on the right to vote um
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
certainly this makes Provisions to make
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
it much easier for an Indigent person
 
01:54:07.599 --> 01:54:10.109 align:start position:0%
it much easier for an Indigent person
to

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
um obtain the information as
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
needed if it cannot be obtained under
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
the uh aspects as mentioned in par sub
 
01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:20.790 align:start position:0%
the uh aspects as mentioned in par sub
paragraph

01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
so any comments or thoughts on this on
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
this particular house bill at this
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
point represent Jameson thank you
 
01:54:36.079 --> 01:54:38.189 align:start position:0%
point represent Jameson thank you
um

01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to say where to start on on
 
01:54:42.669 --> 01:54:42.679 align:start position:0%
this because
 
01:54:42.679 --> 01:54:45.430 align:start position:0%
this because
um

01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
it's first off I guess we heard
 
01:54:51.069 --> 01:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
overwhelming testimony against this bill
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
in about a ratio of 10 to one against um
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
including all the online
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
submissions um the inperson
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
testimony uh we did not hear from the
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor about this bill at all so it's
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
hard to say there was no there was no
 
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
give and take uh questioning there
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the aspect of an affidavit saying I'm
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
poor is
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
I find it hard to believe that we would
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
accept an affidavit saying I'm poor but
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
not accept one saying I'm a citizen and
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
vote um and qualified is one issue I
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
have with that another one is
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
that um the voucher programs we heard
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that it would really only be
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
applicable to folks who were born in New
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is we heard it was about
 
01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
a third of New Hampshire um voters were
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
born here and almost 80% of women's
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
birth certificate doesn't match their
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
name uh when they get married and change
 
01:56:04.589 --> 01:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
their name so query whether that proves
 
01:56:04.599 --> 01:56:05.910 align:start position:0%
their name so query whether that proves
their

01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.430 align:start position:0%
their
citizenship

01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
um that then they would need another
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
document possibly which would be the
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
Merit certificate um or SEC or uh Social
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
Security documents showing the name
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
change which then adds more and more
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
costs and burden
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
um to do that um and the LA well the
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
last thing that's coming to my mind at
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
this point in time is that this
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
basically I think would kill same day
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
registration um and if we want to do
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a policy decision but this
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
is not the way to to do that um in that
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
it does provide that yes you can do it
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
on the same day but there's no way that
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state would I think be
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
able to handle the requests uh to make
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
that happen and as we all know Justice
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
delayed is Justice denied so if we have
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
a a a plan in place that then prevents
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
somebody from same day
 
01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
registration um that is not
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
workable on that same day they would be
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
denied the right to vote
 
01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:17.950 align:start position:0%
denied the right to vote
unnecessarily

01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
um so this there there's all kinds of
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
problems I find with this
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
um with this bill
 
01:57:28.719 --> 01:57:33.069 align:start position:0%
um with this bill
um

01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.430 --> 01:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
so representative Burnham do you have
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
comments Mr chairman yes um I don't
 
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
recall like how is this an issue like do
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
we see many of these issues where an
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
Indigent needs proof of citizenship like
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand where is
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
coming from do we can you help me with
 
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
that have we I believe this is in
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
response to last session's uh House Bill
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
1569 which took away
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
the um ability to swear under penalties
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
of perjury that you are a US
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
citizen um and it's trying to fix that
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
my belief but I'm not 100% sure I see
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's in response to a bill from last
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
session yeah yeah it is it is an House
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 1569 I believe um I think there's
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
they're trying to
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
clarify the requirements for sit for the
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship so just again to to
 
01:58:42.069 --> 01:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
reiterate um there is already well
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
established in and this was part of the
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with Mr Clement toits is
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
there is already a wellestablished
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh for citizenship
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
um and so the uh in in order to vote in
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
elections and New Hampshire unlike some
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
other states does not
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
allow um non-citizens to
 
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
vote having so that is
 
01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:11.930 align:start position:0%
a a
 
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:13.109 align:start position:0%
a a
[Music]

01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
proper qualification for a voter in New
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand then becomes not is
 
01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
that qualification improper but does the
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
proof of that qualification by the voter
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
impose an undue
 
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
hardship um versus uh the state interest
 
01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
to keep elections safe and secure by
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
making sure that in fact that person is
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
indeed a citizen
 
01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
indeed a citizen
so

01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:55.629 --> 01:59:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there there is this is a
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
process of refining exactly how we can
 
02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:01.310 align:start position:0%
process of refining exactly how we can
best

02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
find uh I think someone used the term
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot um balance uh
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
between that requirement to document
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
citizenship versus the efforts required
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
to provide that documentation so uh I
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
think that that is what this bill is is
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
attempting to do um and has made
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
a and has tried to
 
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
anticipate if P if a person may have
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty providing that due to a
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
resource aspect of some sort uh we think
 
02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
resource aspect of some sort uh we think
about

02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
um you know may maybe uh there are
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
homeless populations and other uh people
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
who may have those sorts of issues um at
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
that time so I think that's what this
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill is attempting to do I think I
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comments representative
 
02:01:03.639 --> 02:01:04.709 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comments representative
Newsome

02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
Newsome
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
on um the challenges that you see with
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
this particular bill I think those
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
um uh the Committees the election law
 
02:01:16.030 --> 02:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee will certainly have to
 
02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
consider that as on once uh from an uh
 
02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
executive session standpoint and and
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
then we should consider some of those
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
aspects in our reports as as well from
 
02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:29.550 align:start position:0%
aspects in our reports as as well from
the

02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'd also be willing to
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
bet that that is the subject of the
 
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that uh Mr Clem to was not able
 
02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
to discuss discuss I i' I'm not 100%
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
sure but I'd be willing to bet that is
 
02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
that that uh 1569 is the subject matter
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
of those so I'm sure we'll see guidance
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
branch indeed perhaps uh perhaps one
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
never knows um and we we will the
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will not attempt to uh
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
forecast the future so nor should we
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
wait and on those results exactly uh
 
02:02:15.629 --> 02:02:15.639 align:start position:0%
we'll leave that to other other folks to
 
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
do so but I would also like to just add
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
that I do agree with you that uh
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
citizenship is a
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
required element of registering to vote
 
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
and and is a valid State concern I I I I
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that I'm not
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with you on that so I we we
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
are in agreement on at least one thing
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
right I'm sure as uh the as the public
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
should know is indeed um the majority
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
and minority parties agree on probably
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
70 to 80% of the legislation um
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's the the disagreements
 
02:02:55.069 --> 02:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
that make the news and uh therefore
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's what the public hears about the
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
most um but in in fact there's much that
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
we agree on so but I appreciate the
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
recognition of the agreement on
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
citizenship qualification so thank you
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
for that um all
 
02:03:10.599 --> 02:03:12.709 align:start position:0%
for that um all
right

02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
um representative Lane has not joined us
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
but I I do really feel compelled uh to
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
some degree to start uh in on what is
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
our longest bill um which is RSA
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
654 uh which is I'm sorry H House Bill
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
385 of which there are a number of
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
different sections within the bill
 
02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
pertaining to uh multiple parts of the
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
RSA so um I I did just get a text from
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
her saying she left about three or four
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
minutes ago from her County meeting okay
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
which is just the county offices are
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
just down the road so I would anticipate
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
her AR Ral shortly depending on where
 
02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
she Parks okay uh yes um good point uh
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
let's then
 
02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:05.930 align:start position:0%
um go
 
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:07.109 align:start position:0%
um go
[Music]

02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
to uh let's look
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
at if we
 
02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:14.189 align:start position:0%
at if we
may

02:04:14.189 --> 02:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
um we'll look
 
02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
at 217 which I think really parallels
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
some of our discussion from two from
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
365 um if we have time um we may do one
 
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
other quick bill and then by by that
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
time I'm sure representative Lane will
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
be here and we can go over the
 
02:04:36.639 --> 02:04:38.549 align:start position:0%
be here and we can go over the
um

02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh 385 at that point so let's let's
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
look at 217 um I'll just uh describe
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
that briefly
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
for uh whoever is listening so this has
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
to do with the absence registration
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
affidavit so
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh as this subcommittee has talked about
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
there are really two processes that
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about is uh one is
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
registration the other is uh receiving
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
The Ballot or obtaining the ballot uh
 
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
which on Election Day is the check-in
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
process but uh of course for the
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot um that varies a little
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
bit we heard some testimony from the
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State on that this morning
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
so let me just go over that so this has
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
us amending RSA
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
65417 to read as
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
follows um it shall be prepared the
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
registration absentee registration
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
affidavit shall be prepared by the
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
shall uh contain uh I'll paraphrase
 
02:05:46.109 --> 02:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
contain the following
 
02:05:46.119 --> 02:05:47.790 align:start position:0%
contain the following
information

02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh they uh attest that they they attest
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
to a series of things um and uh swear or
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
affirm under the penalties of voter
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
fraud they attest that they are one a
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States uh they
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
establish their legal domicile is in a
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
town or city I'll be uh age proper
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
voting age on uh election day and
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
entitled to vote in the election to be
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
held in in said town on such and such a
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
date um except for the fact
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that the name does not yet
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
appear on the checklist to be used in
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
the said town at such election so they
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
essentially are not yet registered and
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
are attempting to register and obtain uh
 
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot all right goes on
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
um uh stating their absence
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
um in part two I I do not intend to be
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
present within said town at such time
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
prior to said election that will allow
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
that person to appear before the
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
checklist and uh in their regular
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
sessions for the correction of the
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
checklist for set election so the
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
process is if you're registering the
 
02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist normally
 
02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:17.719 align:start position:0%
have these sessions where you can go in
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
and register with them and uh
 
02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
and so if you're anticipating voting in
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
the next election you can go in and
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
register with the supervisors of the
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
checklist but if you are absent how do
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
you do that um and uh so this allows
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
that process to occur and then they
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
explain their temporary
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
temporarily uh temporarily residing in
 
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
um city and state or city province and
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
Country um
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
they uh enclose copies of the doc
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
documentation required by RSA
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
65412 um again the qualifications to
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
vote that establish citizenship age
 
02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
domicile and
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
identity as qualifications to vote and
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
then they acknowledge that if they do
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
not provide a copy as required of the
 
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
documentation as required by section
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
for above the
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
application uh shall not be
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
approved and and then they I hereby make
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
application for this so this this is
 
02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
really for the voter who is not yet
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
registered in a town or city Ward who um
 
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
because of their circumstances will be
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
away from that town or city Ward uh
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
during the supervisors of the checklist
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
sessions and therefore will not be able
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
to pre-register in that manner
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
and uh of course will also be away
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
during the election day itself and so
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
we'll not be able to register on uh by
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
the same day uh election uh day
 
02:09:07.709 --> 02:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
registration process so they are
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
registering by
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
absentee uh
 
02:09:17.229 --> 02:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
registration and then uh it goes into
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
um and B basically the same thing and
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
they uh next page has basically the same
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and then it explains why
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
the ne the next page really covers the
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
same aspects but then describes uh goes
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
into some detail in sub paragraph two uh
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
why they they cannot appear uh before
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh on Election Day so uh and this has to
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
do primarily with the affidavit for a
 
02:10:02.549 --> 02:10:02.559 align:start position:0%
physical disability
 
02:10:02.559 --> 02:10:04.709 align:start position:0%
physical disability
so

02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
um and then on
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
the third page this
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
is the signature of the
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
witness to support
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
other um rsas that are amended as well
 
02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.390 align:start position:0%
other um rsas that are amended as well
uh

02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
65419 the submission effect and um so
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
and this covers the supporting
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
documentation when it's provided and
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
then down in sub paragraph three uh ver
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
ification of an in-person absentee
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
voter and then U just talks about
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
providing voluntarily a photo
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
identification that meets the
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
requirements uh voter
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
verification and
 
02:11:13.149 --> 02:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
then uh Provisions that if they do not
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
PR present a qualified photo ID they
 
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
will not be treated as a verified
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
voter um and that that is that so um I
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
think so this is
 
02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
um a bill that sort of tries to align
 
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:36.750 align:start position:0%
um a bill that sort of tries to align
the

02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh verification of the voter
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications for people
 
02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
qualifications for people
who

02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
cannot um apply in person to the
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist or will be
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
absent on the day of voting uh and
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
therefore not eligible for making or not
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
present to be able to make a same day
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
registration in that case so that's what
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
this uh particular Bill House Bill 2117
 
02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:06.910 align:start position:0%
this uh particular Bill House Bill 2117
pertains

02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
pertains
 
02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
pertains
to

02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
um so as we as we've heard I think again
 
02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:22.229 align:start position:0%
um so as we as we've heard I think again
the

02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:26.350 --> 02:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
the the greatest challenge or hurdle
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
um is the
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
documentation for citizenship that we've
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
that we've heard discussed this morning
 
02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
so I think that's every most of the rest
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
of this seems to be fairly
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward I think that but that is
 
02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
straightforward I think that but that is
the

02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh one point that would
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
be of some concern and how how do we
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:03.110 align:start position:0%
we enable
 
02:13:03.110 --> 02:13:04.310 align:start position:0%
we enable
[Music]

02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
the uh right to vote without creating an
 
02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:15.189 align:start position:0%
the uh right to vote without creating an
undue

02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
burden any comments from the
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Welcome representative
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
Lane sorry for for being late no that um
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the obligations that that uh
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives also have as County
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
delegates um not everyone understands
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
that so that that's worth uh
 
02:13:34.159 --> 02:13:36.390 align:start position:0%
that so that that's worth uh
mentioning

02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
mentioning
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I I have a question just because
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
I missed all of this and I haven't had a
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
chance to watch all this hate but um did
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
someone speak about citizenship and the
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
history and I I'm going to watch the
 
02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
tape so you don't need to tell me but I
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that somebody
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
had spoken to it and that everybody had
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
the information that they needed yeah
 
02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
okay if I can I'll try and summarize it
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
as as in in two or three uh sentences is
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh no one questions
 
02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:14.830 align:start position:0%
uh no one questions
the

02:14:14.830 --> 02:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
um the citizen no one questions
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
citizenship as a qualification for the
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
right to vote in New
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is well established and
 
02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Clement toes from the ACLU
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
recognized that and and that's been uh
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
long settled in other court cases not
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
not including any of the recent ones
 
02:14:41.069 --> 02:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
that that are um that Mr Allen
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
identified in his research memo that
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond that's a that's long
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
established um the
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
what was discussed most
 
02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:55.669 align:start position:0%
what was discussed most
is

02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
the uh some
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
voters uh will have some
 
02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:05.069 align:start position:0%
voters uh will have some
challenges

02:15:05.069 --> 02:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
providing proof of their
 
02:15:09.159 --> 02:15:16.270 align:start position:0%
providing proof of their
citizenship

02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
and while this
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
um subcommittee does not choose to
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
speculate on pending leg legislation or
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
pending uh litigation
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
um it it's quite possible that some of
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
the pending let uh litigation discusses
 
02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.270 align:start position:0%
the pending let uh litigation discusses
that

02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.629 --> 02:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
um the three documents that provide
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship are a birth
 
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
certificate naturalization papers a
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
when there are changes to names because
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
of marriage or or other things there
 
02:16:02.430 --> 02:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
might be additional documentation
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
required a marriage certificate for
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
example or uh some legal order to change
 
02:16:07.119 --> 02:16:09.709 align:start position:0%
example or uh some legal order to change
one's

02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.719 --> 02:16:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
name

02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
so one of the discussions that was
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
talked about was the state has a
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest to make sure that
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
their elections are safe and secure that
 
02:16:24.430 --> 02:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
only qualified voters are
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
voting um and that is no one contest
 
02:16:32.589 --> 02:16:32.599 align:start position:0%
that uh the challenge is
 
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
then um is an undue
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
burden being imposed on the right to
 
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
vote and
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
and some burden is
 
02:16:52.589 --> 02:16:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
provide those documentate documents as
 
02:16:59.230 --> 02:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
as needed but um it's an untolerable
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
burden that is uh I think part of the
 
02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.589 align:start position:0%
burden that is uh I think part of the
question

02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
here and what do you do in certain
 
02:17:11.469 --> 02:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
circumstances when when people
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh are not able to get uh not able to
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
immediately provide that
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
information do we make Provisions for
 
02:17:20.399 --> 02:17:24.509 align:start position:0%
information do we make Provisions for
that

02:17:24.509 --> 02:17:24.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.519 --> 02:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
right so are there any comments at this
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
217 I think I I know that I didn't
 
02:17:50.349 --> 02:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
participate or here but I'm relatively
 
02:17:50.359 --> 02:17:51.709 align:start position:0%
participate or here but I'm relatively
familiar

02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
02:17:57.389 --> 02:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
um in the United States as a country we
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
have for years satisfied this by an
 
02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:06.589 align:start position:0%
have for years satisfied this by an
affidavit

02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
and on in feder federal elections and in
 
02:18:13.309 --> 02:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
state elections and now it's become an
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
issue and I guess I'll ask the Attorney
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
General this when they come but do we
 
02:18:21.309 --> 02:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
know that because the penalty
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
for someone who is not a
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
citizen to basically lie and say they
 
02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:30.599 align:start position:0%
are a citizen are severe um not only our
 
02:18:30.599 --> 02:18:31.950 align:start position:0%
are a citizen are severe um not only our
State

02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
penalties but the the fact probably
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
there's a they violated Federal and they
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
may well be deported and they probably
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
will never become a US citizen because
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
this will be a felony and so they will
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
not be able to pass the citizenship
 
02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.309 align:start position:0%
not be able to pass the citizenship
requirements

02:18:51.309 --> 02:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
um for naturalization so I guess I I
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
come back to why do we need this bill a
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
and you know what is that burden that
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um you
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
know what is that because it the the
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
ramifications of line about this are
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
it I don't know if anybody I don't know
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
if anybody talk talked about that before
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
or that came up in the conversations but
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
you know those penalties are very I mean
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
it's like a 5,000 or
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
$7,000 fee for state level it's a uh I
 
02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a felony even in the state
 
02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
and or at least a misdemeanor and on on
 
02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
a federal level it's it's even higher
 
02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:42.429 align:start position:0%
a federal level it's it's even higher
yeah

02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's a very interesting point I
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
think um one of the things that was
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
discussed is that there are some
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
um not not within New Hampshire but
 
02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
there are other states that currently
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
have recently have permitted
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
non-citizens voting in local
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
and again hypothetically or
 
02:20:11.790 --> 02:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could anticipate
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
someone from that local moving to New
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and maybe not understanding
 
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire laws are different
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
and then act upon this I mean as a
 
02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:24.349 align:start position:0%
and then act upon this I mean as a
hypothetical

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
only and so um it's not out of the realm
 
02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:30.349 align:start position:0%
only and so um it's not out of the realm
of

02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
of

02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
the border control issues
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
with um people coming into the US
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
without maybe the normal
 
02:21:15.870 --> 02:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
controls uh I think there was a concern
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
that there might be people who would
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
voting people who who would be illegal
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
immigrants would
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
have uh maybe less of a qualm of
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
voting um since they're here illegally
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
but and I I think that's that's sort of
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
the rationale for or that's the concern
 
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard expressed is that
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
if someone is here illegally then the
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
threat of deportation is does not
 
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
increase with voting and you can
 
02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:03.070 align:start position:0%
increase with voting and you can
actually

02:22:03.070 --> 02:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:05.230 align:start position:0%
actually
influence

02:22:05.230 --> 02:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
influence
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh elections in your
 
02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:12.070 align:start position:0%
uh elections in your
favor

02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
um uh really really with no change to
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
current consequences so that again we're
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
talking hypothetical so
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
right and I also would if I was that
 
02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
person I think you'd be more likely to
 
02:22:28.270 --> 02:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
be found if you're giving if you're
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
registering and you're providing first
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
of all you'd have to get a fake you'd
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
have to get a fake ID you'd have to get
 
02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of fake stuff and then you're
 
02:22:37.309 --> 02:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
going to go on and you're going to be on
 
02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
the rolles with an address so if
 
02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to come and Deport you
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
you've kind of just raised a red flag
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
said here I am so in some ways maybe
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
they don't even they even have less of
 
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
incentive but and I guess it comes down
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
to in my mind when you talk about these
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
theoretical problems I think somebody
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
testified that there was nine% uh don't
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the population generally don't have
 
02:23:04.750 --> 02:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
these documents readily available and we
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
had a lot of testimony before about that
 
02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
too I think was maybe it was last year I
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
don't remember but is it I guess the
 
02:23:15.389 --> 02:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
question comes down to is is it worth
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
saving those maybe five or six people
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
who come in and and try and and keep out
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
9% of our voters I mean is that and
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's to me when you talked about the
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
balance or the burden you know how many
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
people are you willing to disenfranchise
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
in order to catch a theoretical person
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
vote and as just framing it that that's
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
how I think about it it's like how many
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
people do we disenfranchise before we
 
02:23:55.870 --> 02:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
is uh is
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
there so you you've already said that
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
you you do agree that citizenship is a
 
02:24:07.230 --> 02:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
is a qual with so right and it has been
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
um if we if we then
 
02:24:23.790 --> 02:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh have established that we are going to
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
verify that as a
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
qualifying or we we will require proof
 
02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:30.349 align:start position:0%
qualifying or we we will require proof
of

02:24:30.349 --> 02:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
that um and we allow ample
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
immediately I can I can fill
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
out um according
 
02:24:58.990 --> 02:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
to 217 you I will supply this
 
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:05.230 align:start position:0%
to 217 you I will supply this
information

02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
um at at some I guess I would ask at
 
02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:11.110 align:start position:0%
um at at some I guess I would ask at
some

02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
point doesn't this have to
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
be this this information should be
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
available at some point
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
right well well I guess we've gone since
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
1787 without having it without
 
02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
undue problems so why not we and we have
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
an affidavit right now that people have
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
been signing with no problems and if we
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
and we have penalties that exist that if
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
you lie you know then there's a big
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
penalty so in my
 
02:25:49.309 --> 02:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
mind why require somebody to come I mean
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
first of all it takes months
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
right and to get naturalization papers
 
02:25:55.269 --> 02:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
is very expensive I mean people have
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
tossed around numbers like $500 $600 to
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
get them
 
02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
and and yet they're Lo you're we're
 
02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
having them lose their most important
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
right um because they can't find these
 
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
papers I mean and not everyone not
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
everyone has easy access to a lot of
 
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
stuff so part ofy says if you catch
 
02:26:19.389 --> 02:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
somebody and we have lots of people
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
watching the poll and the Attorney
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
General's staff is there watching the
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
polls and we have moderators checking
 
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
people in and if you have an affidavit
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
and you're swearing on the
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
affidavit why is that still not good
 
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
enough why do we need this extra
 
02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
documentation when even the federal
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
it I I think what we've heard um I think
 
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
it was Mr Richard who testified that
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
what we have is is it's not really the
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
classic legal affidavit but is instead a
 
02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
classic legal affidavit but is instead a
self-verification

02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
self-verification
 
02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.429 align:start position:0%
self-verification
documentation

02:26:58.429 --> 02:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
document um and that we've actually
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
moved away from the full legal
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
definition of an affidavit again i' I'd
 
02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
have to revie viw my notes on um his
 
02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding the affidavit but uh
 
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
I do believe that there are some people
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
do who do have some concern
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
concerns with what the rsas currently
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
call um an affidavit so right but again
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'd have to I did I I remember his
 
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and what I um I started
 
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
looking through the RS the election law
 
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
rsas and there's a lot of instances of
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
affidavits with people swearing under
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
penalty you know that they first of all
 
02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
it's penalty of perjury then there's
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
going to be penalty of of of the um of
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
the law of the election laws and which
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
enable them to like it's a
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um one's a one is a $5,000
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
penalty there's a felony and a high and
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
a criminal and then there's civil and a
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the exact details but
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of penalties built in and
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
we can write an affidavit that would do
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
that so I would want to look at his
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
statement because I'm not
 
02:28:19.389 --> 02:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
sure because we've had these affidavits
 
02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
and people have been been prosecuted on
 
02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:22.630 align:start position:0%
and people have been been prosecuted on
these

02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
affidavits um and again when maybe when
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
we get the Attorney General in here we
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
can ask them about that but if you're
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
signing something and saying you're
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
attesting to and you're affirming and
 
02:28:35.550 --> 02:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
you're subject to the penalties and
 
02:28:37.230 --> 02:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
you're signing it whether you have a
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
witness or not you've signed it you'd
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to prove that it that's not your
 
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
signature I mean and somebody's want you
 
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
know I I'm not sure
 
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
that I want to look at it because I
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
think you could craft an affidavit that
 
02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:55.309 align:start position:0%
think you could craft an affidavit that
would

02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
work and that would be much easier for
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
people to
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
sign and particularly if they're doing
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
same day registration they're signing it
 
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
in front of somebody after they've
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
already showed their
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
identification right do I have the
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
process they've already showed if we're
 
02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
doing same day registration they've
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
showed their ID now they're
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
proving now they have to prove domicile
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
and citizenship and these other things
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
so if they can sign an affidavit as to
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
citizenship the person who's doing the
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
same day registration is there in front
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
of them um and so they and they have
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
their ID so they can't come back and
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
claim that wasn't me unless there's a
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
fake ID and then we have then and then
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
whoever this person is is going to be
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
liable for I mean you can throw the book
 
02:29:56.110 --> 02:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
it it
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
is so I
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just thinking through that
 
02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:08.370 align:start position:0%
is um if they're able to
 
02:30:08.370 --> 02:30:09.790 align:start position:0%
is um if they're able to
[Music]

02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
prove if if they have a proper ID they
 
02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
prove if if they have a proper ID they
can

02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:30:20.429 --> 02:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
show uh do evidence of domicile
 
02:30:20.439 --> 02:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
show uh do evidence of domicile
and

02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
age um
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're what are you saying then with
 
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
regard to citizenship sign an affidavit
 
02:30:33.389 --> 02:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
sign an affidavit right I mean that's
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
now and then at at what but the
 
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
often in in the process where we've had
 
02:30:50.190 --> 02:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
these affid before you were there
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
required to provide proof subsequently
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
you're provide required to provide
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
evidence within seven days or something
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
like that if you know in the um
 
02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:05.230 align:start position:0%
like that if you know in the um
so

02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
at at some point do you not have to
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.110 --> 02:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship I've never had
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
to and I got my birth certificate oh
 
02:31:22.030 --> 02:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
when I when I got my passport I had to
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
prove it and the hospital that I was
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
born in had burned down and so it was an
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
exercise to find it and it definitely
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
took me more than a month and it
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
definitely took me more than a week so
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and I so and I know I mean somebody
 
02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
testified last year that they uh were
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
adopted and they had no idea where they
 
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
were born and they had no idea where to
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
to find a birth certificate
 
02:31:53.389 --> 02:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't I'm suspecting that's not an
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstance so again how many
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
people do we disenfranchise because
 
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
we're scared that somebody's going to
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
come in and commit fraud and again I
 
02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
want to ask the AG's office you know if
 
02:32:11.630 --> 02:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
he's aware of anything in New Hampshire
 
02:32:13.389 --> 02:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
and I guess you know is there are there
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
PE I'm assuming this must be happening
 
02:32:19.269 --> 02:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
nationally but where but where is it you
 
02:32:21.950 --> 02:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
know where is is it happening and and if
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's not really happening then then why
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
do we need to solve a problem that's not
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
um a bit of a dilemma here we here we
 
02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
have a qualification for which we need
 
02:32:50.680 --> 02:32:52.469 align:start position:0%
have a qualification for which we need
no

02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
evidence uh so that it's an interesting
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting perspective we have
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
a qualification for which we need no
 
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
evidence well so the evidence is the
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
person who's signing the affidavit under
 
02:33:07.269 --> 02:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
law you know and who I I I don't know I
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
mean to me we've never had to do that in
 
02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:14.469 align:start position:0%
mean to me we've never had to do that in
New

02:33:14.469 --> 02:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since the Constitution was put
 
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
in until recently and in that time time
 
02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
span I don't know Math's not my strong
 
02:33:25.309 --> 02:33:25.319 align:start position:0%
point so but roughly 200 years we've
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
never really had a problem so if we've
 
02:33:30.030 --> 02:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
never really had a problem with the
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
citizenship piece then why do we need to
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
make people go through this exercise if
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's not been a problem or if they can't
 
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
prove it or they don't have the
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
documentation then sign an
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
affidavit and if we really want to go
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
after people for and if we find out
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
they've not voted correctly or they're
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
not a citz listen because there's my
 
02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
understanding there's no one place that
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
you can go in the federal government to
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
find out if somebody is a US citizen and
 
02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
we ran into this last year when we were
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
trying to do bills because I think it
 
02:34:08.349 --> 02:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
was Senator gray who wanted to rely on
 
02:34:11.710 --> 02:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
federal databases to prove this but then
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
it came
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
out during the hearing that there's
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
really nowhere to do that I mean if that
 
02:34:20.590 --> 02:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
was something that was easy to do sure
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
you can verify it but right now that's
 
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
not something that's easy to do and not
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
everybody not all the supervisors can
 
02:34:32.269 --> 02:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
get to that Statewide or that Federal
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
database on on the election day because
 
02:34:38.670 --> 02:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
of connectivity issues right right and
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually I think um House Bill 217 does
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
address that aspect because there you
 
02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
they recognize that there would be
 
02:34:49.389 --> 02:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
concerns with election day duties as
 
02:34:49.399 --> 02:34:50.790 align:start position:0%
concerns with election day duties as
well

02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:52.990 --> 02:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
that that trying
 
02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
to uh close the loop on the evidence of
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
citizenship in on an election day is
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
something that would
 
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome for the election
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
officials because of their duties and so
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
therefore uh there were allowances to um
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
cure is not probably the correct term
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:33.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
um all right so I think that's
 
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
um we may actually have the evidence of
 
02:35:42.590 --> 02:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship may actually be a good
 
02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
question for our esteemed
 
02:35:49.349 --> 02:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
researcher um so I will uh Mr Allen um
 
02:35:49.359 --> 02:35:50.550 align:start position:0%
researcher um so I will uh Mr Allen um
uh

02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
I I will try and craft a well- worded uh
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
question to you and uh ask for some you
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
to research uh if there are other states
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
that are requiring this sort of evidence
 
02:36:05.550 --> 02:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
of citizenship and what are the
 
02:36:08.190 --> 02:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
provisions I will gladly rely on
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's better research than mine but
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
a quick Google search has showed that
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's eight only eight states require
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship one of which Kansas
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
is is not being enforced because of a
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
court decision so we are in the extreme
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
extreme minority of states there well
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
as yes and and uh New Hampshire is is uh
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned earlier has its own
 
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
unique aspects we are included as one of
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
those eight states on this list saying
 
02:36:42.990 --> 02:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we require firsttime voters to
 
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
present proof of citizenship when
 
02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
registering so we are included in that
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
list of eight as in that Minority of of
 
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
States yes that was in HB 1569 which was
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
year all right so we will uh I will
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
craft a a
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
um question for our researcher to to
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
look into that
 
02:37:12.479 --> 02:37:15.030 align:start position:0%
look into that
and

02:37:15.030 --> 02:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
um see what see what we can find
 
02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
well and uh just for the record the
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
for conference state legislators yeah
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's what so
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
um that's that's you that's a good place
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
to start just for comparison but so
 
02:37:56.319 --> 02:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
to start just for comparison but so
um

02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:07.950 --> 02:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
um you might you might get a couple of
 
02:38:14.269 --> 02:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
requests coming out as well so uh
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
um well we have we only have 20 minutes
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm um it's already
 
02:38:33.389 --> 02:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
128 by my watch 128 so
 
02:38:43.030 --> 02:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm reluctant to have you cover a
 
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
19 Page House bill um in I'd give you
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
one minute per page uh okay but
 
02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:55.750 align:start position:0%
one minute per page uh okay but
uh

02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:58.510 --> 02:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
um uh do
 
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
you would you prefer that we cover it on
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh March
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
7th yes okay yes but I can say and I can
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
sent I think I sent to you the sections
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the rcas that were Affiliated and the
 
02:39:17.309 --> 02:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
short version of this is that it
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
repeals 1569 and puts everything back
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
the way it was before HB 1569 passed
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
which I may be wrong I don't remember
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
1569 being this extensive I don't think
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
it was 19 Pages was it all we did well
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
ol yes it was that's why we were not
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
happy with it but um we um and if it
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
does if it does more that was not the
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
intent the intent was to appeal it and
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
so what OS did was go back to the
 
02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:54.269 align:start position:0%
so what OS did was go back to the
statutes

02:39:54.269 --> 02:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
02:39:58.110 --> 02:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
before 1569 was enacted and put the back
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
undid okay that so just so theoretically
 
02:40:09.389 --> 02:40:09.399 align:start position:0%
if if I took 1569 and took this bill I
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
could go you should be able to okay and
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
if if there's a mistake then we can talk
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
about that but um yeah no no because I I
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
can blame OS but that's not really fair
 
02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
because you know I'm in charge of right
 
02:40:28.269 --> 02:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
the buck stops here yep exactly um and
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes they were crunched and yes this was
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
a huge thing but they did an amazing job
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
they really were very good on this
 
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
because this was not a easy lift so uh
 
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
so just as a assignment for the
 
02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee then is is in the
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
intervening two weeks let's go through
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
I'll go house bill 1569 from last year
 
02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
and then House Bill 384 is 3 38585 yeah
 
02:40:55.880 --> 02:40:57.389 align:start position:0%
and then House Bill 384 is 3 38585 yeah
385

02:40:57.389 --> 02:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
385
 
02:41:01.389 --> 02:41:01.399 align:start position:0%
and um go through and do a comparison
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was
 
02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.710 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was
nothing

02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
um no surprises I guess worked in and it
 
02:41:12.269 --> 02:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
was truly a taking it a a true repeal
 
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
where it was taking it back to the
 
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
wording it was established beforehand um
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
because that will be simpler to
 
02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
um address and
 
02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
um address and
explain

02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
explain
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
um and discuss if if we know that as the
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
basis for our discussion right and and
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
it would be understandable because the I
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
forget the exact timing but the timing
 
02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
between the governor approving it I
 
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
think I had one day left to file a bill
 
02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
so if there is an
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
error I wouldn't be necessarily
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
surprised giving the rush but we felt it
 
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
was important to um because it had been
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated he was going to veto it and
 
02:41:58.510 --> 02:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
then he approved it and so we had I
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
think one day to
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
file right right so that's why I'm just
 
02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
saying it would not necessarily surprise
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
me if we find a few snafus okay but
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I think this committee on you know
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
for uh this subcommittee uh should
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
should do that as part of the um under
 
02:42:30.910 --> 02:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
our scope of responsibility so that we
 
02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
can report back up to the to the main
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee any uh discrepancies we might
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
find with that premise that you outlined
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then um again I'm I'm sure after our
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
discussions we'll we'll have interesting
 
02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
reports to uh give back to both a
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
majority Minority Report to send up to
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
the ELC as a
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
whole um as to what our recommendations
 
02:42:57.359 --> 02:42:58.910 align:start position:0%
whole um as to what our recommendations
might

02:42:58.910 --> 02:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
be and so how how should I get the list
 
02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
of all the statutes all the sections
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
affected to everybody is that something
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
that you can send to the subcommittee I
 
02:43:15.389 --> 02:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to violate um 391 issues so
 
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh I can what if I read them out yeah
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
why don't you read them out and then
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
that way that way people can look at
 
02:43:30.429 --> 02:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
them and it's in the record and it's in
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
the record and and we can um then uh you
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
know start the discussion on the 7eventh
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we'll go into it in in detail and
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
and see what if everyone has done their
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
proper homework we'll we'll see what I'm
 
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
sorry what people are uh finding out in
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
terms of the comparison Okay so go ahead
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
please all right so um
 
02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
654 colon 12 is on page
 
02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:56.670 align:start position:0%
654 colon 12 is on page
1

02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.680 align:start position:0%

14 659 colon 27 is also on page
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
14 659 colon 27-a is on page
 
02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
15 659 colon 13 Roman numeral 1
 
02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
parentheses small C is Page
 
02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
parentheses small C is Page
17

02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
17
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
65913 Roman numeral 2 parentheses B
 
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
through e are on page 18 and the last
 
02:44:43.469 --> 02:44:43.479 align:start position:0%
one is five Colon 6-d D Roman numeral 2
 
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
and that's on page
 
02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
19 can you repeat that last one uh uh
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
five colon
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
6-d as in dog Roman numeral 2 thank you
 
02:44:59.070 --> 02:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
so the the last RSA that you mentioned
 
02:45:01.389 --> 02:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
is not within the election law it's five
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
no no I and I can't remember exactly but
 
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
it was in representative L lens bill so
 
02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
I I can't remember which one that I can
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
up yeah it's it's interesting it's not
 
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
the same uh RSA statutes that Define
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
resent or residency so um and they were
 
02:45:26.269 --> 02:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear that in our discussion
 
02:45:28.750 --> 02:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's a cross reference chapter five is
 
02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
Department of State yeah so it'll
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
probably be a secretary of state it
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
it it it's a reference to the Hava Hava
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
act hav so I think that that so it has
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
to do with Hava yes and there was a
 
02:45:45.389 --> 02:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
cross reference that they put in or took
 
02:45:48.030 --> 02:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
out I can't remember now but that's it's
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
okay right so there yeah probably some
 
02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions under Hava that we need to
 
02:46:01.710 --> 02:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
make sure we address
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
so all
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
is there at this point I don't think uh
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
because of the time we only have about
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
11 minutes left or so um I'll just ask
 
02:46:30.429 --> 02:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee if there are any
 
02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
further comments and if not we'll we'll
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
um uh end today's working session again
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
I think we've had a lot of testimony
 
02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
today on the legal precedence and some
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
of the history behind that
 
02:46:52.750 --> 02:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
and some discussions
 
02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:54.670 align:start position:0%
and some discussions
about

02:46:54.670 --> 02:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh doile and residency and and how they
 
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
are now essentially the
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh 28 I believe it was 2018 House
 
02:47:17.790 --> 02:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 1264 as well as subsequent court
 
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
cases um the 2020 decision of Casey
 
02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
versus uh Secretary of
 
02:47:29.469 --> 02:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
State and a number
 
02:47:33.469 --> 02:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
of uh four questions were answered
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
regarding that and and so again anyone
 
02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:40.550 align:start position:0%
regarding that and and so again anyone
who

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
um has should wants to follow up on that
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
that would be uh I think important to
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
understand that that's
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh I certainly think one of the Hallmark
 
02:47:57.790 --> 02:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
cases that we need to consider as we
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
um try and summarize uh positions on
 
02:48:06.990 --> 02:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
this so I'll just go around the room
 
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Nome any uh
 
02:48:13.309 --> 02:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
comments or considerations for this
 
02:48:13.319 --> 02:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
comments or considerations for this
subcommittee

02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
um at this point I'm gonna say I think
 
02:48:28.110 --> 02:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
we've covered it and we still have a lot
 
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
of work to do ahead and look forward to
 
02:48:32.269 --> 02:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
getting into the nitty-gritty and
 
02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the broader policy
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
considerations um as we go forward and
 
02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
applying those policy
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
considerations to create consistent
 
02:48:48.910 --> 02:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
Fair um and
 
02:48:52.429 --> 02:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
achieving the goal of secure elections
 
02:48:55.870 --> 02:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Nome
 
02:48:58.990 --> 02:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham any uh comments
 
02:49:03.269 --> 02:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I do not have any comments
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
or questions but um it's been very
 
02:49:12.429 --> 02:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
informative having um guests here to
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
explain um certain procedures and things
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
like that so I think that's going to
 
02:49:18.750 --> 02:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
help us to determine what we need to do
 
02:49:21.229 --> 02:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
do moving forward I guess that's my
 
02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:27.389 --> 02:49:27.399 align:start position:0%

02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%

called from the Attorney General's
 
02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
office yes I um uh deputy secretary
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hennessy was kind enough to provide a
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%

yeah this is it's not a subpoena that's
 
02:51:17.870 --> 02:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
for sure so um we get maybe we could
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
just we could come up with list of
 
02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:22.349 align:start position:0%
