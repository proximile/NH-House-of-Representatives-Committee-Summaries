about changing a few lines of the
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
current statute that will allow
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%

homemade food laws thousands of new home
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
will help the economy uh selling
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
homemade food is especially important
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when many find
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
themselves out of work in other states
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
for example out of work chefs and
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant workers have been able to
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
sell homemade food to help make

people should have the choice to buy
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
homemade foods this bill is about
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
individual individual freedom and
 
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.790 align:start position:0%
individual individual freedom and
Economic

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
Economic
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Mr chairman what the bill
 
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
does is it changes restrictions and
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
brings New Hampshire up to speed with
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
the best practices in other states
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
homesteaders no longer will need a
 
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:04.839 align:start position:0%
license to sell shelf to sell shelf St
 
00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:06.069 align:start position:0%
license to sell shelf to sell shelf St
stable

00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
stable
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
Foods as long as you're just selling
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
shelf stable foods you can sell directly
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
to Consumers online and to retail stores
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
with no license
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
required this bill also gets rid of the
 
00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:20.990 align:start position:0%
required this bill also gets rid of the
sales

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
sales
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
cap Most states do not have a sales
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
cap and if you do not have a if you do
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
have a license you can sell perishable
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
foods and meals and aifi or canned foods
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
but that is only with the license that's
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
things such as pickles or
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
relish and the only restriction is that
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
you can't sell meat or seafood or
 
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.389 align:start position:0%
you can't sell meat or seafood or
alcoholic

00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
alcoholic
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
beverages now New Hampshire's current
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
law uh 49 states allow the sale of
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
homemade food but our law is very
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
restrictive compared to other states
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
homesteaders have to deal with a lot of
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
red tape and
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.670 align:start position:0%
red tape and
restrictions

00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
homesteaders need to get a burdensome
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
license if they want to sell online or
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
to retail shops or over $20,000 in gross
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
sales and $20,000 can be very low after
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
subtracting for ingredients and other
 
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
expenses homesteaders are left with only
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
a few thousand dollars left in profit
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
and even with the license homesteaders
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
can only sell shelf stable Foods also
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
known as foods that are not potentially
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
hazardous you can't even sell simple
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
perishable foods like cheese cake or
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
pizza or mac and
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
cheese you also can't sell aifi foods
 
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.269 align:start position:0%
cheese you also can't sell aifi foods
like

00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
pickles now in this bill we've added a
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
section five it has to do with poultry
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
and poultry products and in this bill
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
they can be sold if the homestead
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
Slaughters no more than a thousand
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
poultry raised by the homestead food
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
operations during the calendar year if
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
the homestead operation does not sell
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
products bought elsewhere meaning they
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
must be raised by the homestead
 
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.150 align:start position:0%

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
col4 also we add a section six this bill
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
also prms any local government
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%

state Mr chairman in times like these
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
living in a pandemic many many folks are
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to increase their
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
household Revenue uh their
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
income many have exhausted the ability
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
to stay on unemployment and many
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
businesses are struggling just to keep
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
their doors open the supply chain has
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
been broken but locally we can fix part
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
of that and as we do it without
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
punishing the homesteaders with
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory fees and Licensing costs on
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%

means of course Mr chairman the labeling
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
will still need to occur uh directions
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
for how and when to use and ingredients
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
all of that stays in place and for
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to sell any food
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
product that could be be deemed
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%

representative from testifying and he
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
kept going which leads me to believe
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
somehow I was
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
muted uh well you weren't muted but we
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
reached out to our um our Tech person I
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
kerk okay um May I proceed then with a
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
question representative Nunes yes please
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
ask your question okay um thank you very
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
much I am a little bit confused when you
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
commented about your Amendment you said
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
it just changed a couple words but in my
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
mind it seems to change fundamentally
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
the entire point of the bill because the
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh we're dealing with the
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions from lure and the Bill had
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
that Homestead food operations selling
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food would be
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
Exempted your Amendment said if they're
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
selling food that is not potentially
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous and not is only one word but
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
it completely changes the entire meaning
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill what is it you're really
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
achieve uh thank you representative for
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
the question uh and I understand the
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
confusion there uh the the knot is what
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
was left out and that's what came in the
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
amendment uh it's just just a couple of
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
words but you're right it does
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change the bill as it was
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
drafted uh this amendment says food that
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
is not potentially hazardous that's what
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here food that is not
 
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.990 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here food that is not
potentially

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
hazardous is that
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
on it's on the
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
amendment oh whoever is that one without
 
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.470 align:start position:0%
amendment oh whoever is that one without
the

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.269 --> 00:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
bill M representative if you'll let me
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
explain the the amendment for just a
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
moment Mr chairman may I do that yes
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
proceed uh Mr chairman and members of
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
the committee uh we found we found two
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
errors in the bill uh when we sent it to
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
OS it came back it it was it was small
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
so we missed it whenever we were going
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
over the bill and I do apologize for the
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
confusion on the original Bill if you
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
look at um at line three of the of the
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
original bill it says potentially
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous food the amendment changes
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
that to food that is not potentially
 
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.909 align:start position:0%
that to food that is not potentially
hazardous

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
food and then if you look in section two
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
on line
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
21 again it says potentially hazardous
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
food and we change that to food that is
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
not potentially hazardous those are the
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
only two changes
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the amendment uh against the
 
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.070 align:start position:0%
uh in the amendment uh against the
original

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
mixed up on this double negative maybe I
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
thought the whole point was of this bill
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
was to allow the sale of potentially
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
hazardous food because it could spoil it
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
would not have to be shelf stable in
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
order to allow them to sell a whole lot
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
can thank you representative gay for the
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
question and uh let me clarify once
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
again we're we're talking about food
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
that is shelf stable that has a cap on
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
sales and that cap was currently set at
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
$20,000 uh we want to lift the cap for
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
food that is that is deemed not
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous and to also allow
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill mac and cheese is
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
out yes prepared food is out except for
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
Pou Tre products

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
has thank you representative gay uh if I
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
understand your question uh poultry is
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
already allowed under uh
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
statute to be
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
sold this just adds this adds this into
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
this this bill to allow for up to 1,000
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
homestead okay uh representative Weber
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman um my
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
question is uh I had an email from
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who is very excited about this
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill because she said it would allow her
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
daughter to sell cheesecake is that
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative Weber
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
for the question uh I'm sorry that is
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
not correct uh cheesecake is open aired
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
and the the only type of pies or
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
anything that could be sold or double
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
crusted as statute Ari
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
States and can I ask one follow up
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
please um
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
the could you explain to us where the
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
definition of shelf stable food is
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
because this is an
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
exception and I think when we look at
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
over at home we're going to need to know
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
where the definition of self self-stable
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
food is that's a great question
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
representative ever and I'm I'm
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm not able to answer
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
that for you but I will research that
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
and get it right back to the committee
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
if you could email that to us that would
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
be helpful and I'll retain other
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions until we've had a chance to
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
look at the bill a absolutely
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
representative I'll get that done for
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative Pearson
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
we have um some hands on the screen
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
representative snow representative Marsh
 
00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
representative snow representative Marsh
representative

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh we'll start with
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wondered
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're saying you can sell poultry uh
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
which surprises me but no meat or meat
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
products but I'm wondering aren certain
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
Meats dried Meats um that are shelf
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
stable I forget what you call it but you
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
know dried out beef is certainly would
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
be I think meat to death is a shelf
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
stable because it can last forever is
 
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.509 align:start position:0%
stable because it can last forever is
that

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.389 align:start position:0%
that
conflict

00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative snow for the
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
question uh the way that I understand uh
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
the statute is that uh any type of meat
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
or meat products that are already
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
controlled uh under potentially
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
hazardous in which I think we're talking
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
about beef here things like that um that
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
still has to um stay within the current
 
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.389 align:start position:0%
still has to um stay within the current
RSA

00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
143a uh colon 14 um we're we're only
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
allowing in this bill to add to add
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
poultry which is which is already
 
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
covered so we you know we'd like to move
 
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
forward with that we're not we're not
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
talking about meat or meat byproducts or
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol okay representative
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
Marsh uh thank you Mr chairman I uh
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
raised my hand for two reasons first of
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to demonstrate to people
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
including representative kerk who is
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
waving that there is a hand rais
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
function at the bottom of the zoom
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
screen and second of all I would like to
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
ask representative Nunes whether this
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill is in fact necessary because my
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
family has been able to buy numerous
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
farm rais products over the years uh
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
from local farms including grass-fed
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
beef pork uh chickens turkeys raw milk
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
and vegetables and this bill has not uh
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
obviously been put into law so I would
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
ask him to address that
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh that's a great
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
question uh the way that I understand
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with this bill is we're
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
removing the cap which is a $20,000 cap
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh to allow for homesteaders who want to
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
create these types of products to be
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
able to sell more to help their families
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh in these times especially that are
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
trying but going forward we'd like to be
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
able to see this work out so that these
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
homesteaders uh can have a better access
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
to bringing in a little bit of extra
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
income for their for their families
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
especially since uh during during this
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic now we've seen all of our um
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
material prices go up uh people who may
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
can things or jar things or even buying
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
buying ingredients or using ingredients
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
off your farm everything is more
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
expensive now and we want to be able to
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
lighten the regulation on them a little
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
bit by removing the cap and then by also
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
allowing them to process poultry through
 
00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
allowing them to process poultry through
this

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
bill I thank you thank you very much sir
 
00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
bill I thank you thank you very much sir
representative

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
represent news I looked at the bill and
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
help me for clarification on the bill
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's proposed not the amendment but on
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
the bill on line 24 and
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
25 it says the sale through a retail
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
store is exemp from regulation which
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're proposing along with licens your
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
department departmental inspection
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
however if you go down to the next
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
section in section three it says at that
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
point in time they would have regulation
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
or control over it so I'm kind of
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
confused between the exemption of
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
Regulation but then the next section it
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
includes that they would actually have
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
regulation which includes potentially
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
hazardous food so we're looking to
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
strict say if it's non potentially
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
hazardous that's exempt or are they
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
exempt from
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
everything well they're not exempt from
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
anything if it's if it is a potentially
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
hazardous food that's already that's
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
already created in statute and it would
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
stay potentially hazardous food this is
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
about shelf stable food lighten up the
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
the um the regulation so that they may
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
be able to sell
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
more did I answer your question sir well
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
it probably looking at the words if you
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
will but where it says or to retail food
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
stores on line 24 are exempt it's want
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be clear that we're exempting only
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
non-p potentially hazardous Boot and not
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
all exemption including corre
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
representative that is correct thank you
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's clarification and Mr
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
question yes please sorry thank you Mr
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
chairman in regards to the internet and
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
sales is this strictly for instate or
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
will include out of
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
state I I would think that it would it
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
would include anywhere that they may be
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
able to sell
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
to okay thank you representative McKay
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
chairman

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
section six which is line 21 it seems to
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
me that that eliminates all local
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
intention I'm I'm not sure that I
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
completely understood what the
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative said could someone repeat
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
it for me the uh under line 21 on page
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
two which is the bottom of it it it's a
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
section that essentially says local
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
government has nothing to say about
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative for the
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
question that is true that this section
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh says that we will preempt any
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
local government regulations prohibiting
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
and regulating production the sale of
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
home state H Homestead food producers as
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representative Weber
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean that this preempts local
 
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.950 align:start position:0%
does that mean that this preempts local
zoning

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.629 align:start position:0%
zoning
regulations

00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
well that's that's a good question
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you keep stomping
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
me here um I will I will write that
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
question down and get that back to you
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
but as I understand the way we wrote the
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
Bill uh this makes us have one statute
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
for everyone in the
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
state may I have a followup yes you may
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
is in the room
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
statute preempt for example the city of
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
nasha's food regulations that's one
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
thing but as written it says this
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
section preempts any local government
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
regulations prohibiting and regulating
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
the production and sale of homes to
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
producers and uh zoning laws would
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
prohibit certain uses so that's what I'm
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
driving at would it Trump local zoning
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
LA and again you can just add that to
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
your list of things to get back to us on
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative Pearson we
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
have several um hands up we have
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant representative
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
kerk and representative
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
Shapiro okay and uh I will first ask my
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
question and that is um the bottom of
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
page one line 27 the the strikeout is
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
$20,000 maximum it doesn't raise the
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
dollar amount it eliminates it and my
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
question is when does homestead food
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
business thank you Mr Mr chair for the
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
question um I I believe that that uh
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
again that's another question that I'm
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to answer for you uh get
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
an answer for you but
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I know that there are regulations
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
that are out there about how we form
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
small businesses and what those small
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
businesses are supposed to do and not do
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
um I will I will figure out that for you
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
and get that information back to you and
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize Mr
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
chairman you know we've seen a lot of
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
good things come out of the house where
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of questions asked at a
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
hearing like this and people did some
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
work on it and it turned out pretty fine
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
so uh this this is just the first step
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for your
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
understanding chairman ask a procedural
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
question yes of course thank you is this
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
a bill that might go to a
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh it is and I I ask that
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
because it might be easier on people
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
asking questions if they know that some
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
of the word smithing might have another
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity and they don't have to get
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
everything down right now and that might
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
help us proceed more quickly thank you
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
for that voice of wisdom and
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
experience um okay representative
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
kerk thank you okay I am continually
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
stumped at what this bill is actually
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do and bear with me for a
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
moment um in statute RSA 143 A5 gives
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
the exemptions for
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
lure the exemption in seven and this is
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
in either the original bill or in uh the
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
amendment line three which strikes out
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
the annual sales the exemption currently
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
says that you are exempt from lure if
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
you sell less than
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
$20,000 by removing that you've actually
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
achieved precisely the opposite of your
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
goal that is you've said that everybody
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
even if they sell $10 worth of materials
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to
 
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.309 align:start position:0%
would be subjected to
licensure

00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
um is that not correct because you're
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
removing the exemption of the
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
cap I'm removing oh I'm sorry uh thank
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
you representative for the question
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're not removing the exemption for the
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
cap we're removing the
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
cap yes but but may I sorry follow up
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
yes but but you aren't removing the cap
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
because the cap refers to an exemption
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
if you are producing less than that
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
maximum amount you are exempt from lure
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
which is what um um 143 A5 is all about
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
those are the
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions by removing that I mean if
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
you go back to the statute itself 143 A5
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
it's exemptions the following
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
establishments shall be exempt from
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
departmental iure and then it gives us
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
laundry list one of which is Homestead
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
food sell operations that are selling
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
less than a maximum annual gross sales
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
by striking that language you have just
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
made them not exempt that representative
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the way that I understood it
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
but that's a very good point and if I'm
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
re if I'm redirected to over to that
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
stat statute we may need to amend uh
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
something else in order to make this
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
bill uh push through final
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
followup one more yeah just look at the
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
statute 143 A5 um which is what uh uh
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 7 is extracted
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
from and I the answer would be remove
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
the striketh through because what you've
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
done is just the
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
opposite thank
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.910 align:start position:0%
opposite thank
you

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I believe you
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
had your hand
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
up no Mr chairman you eloquently asked
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
the same question I was going to ask
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance on this but I am a
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
little bit unclear if we're talking
 
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.870 align:start position:0%
little bit unclear if we're talking
about

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little bit unclear about the
 
00:39:27.309 --> 00:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
difference between licensure and
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
Regulation and is the intention of this
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill to take these exemptions and make
 
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.309 align:start position:0%
bill to take these exemptions and make
it

00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
so a license is not necessary or is it
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
to change the regulations for people who
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
are going to continue to be
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
licensed thank you representative for
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
the question this is this is about those
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
homesteaders that are now currently
 
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
forced to get a license this remove this
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
allows as defined in the bill for them
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is Colleen Smith
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of the food
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
protection section the food protection
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
section is within the division of Public
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
Health Services of the Department of
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
Services um this due to this amendment
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
um it does change our testimony some
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat we had prepared some testimony
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
and submitted it to the committee in
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
advance um we do would still have some
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
concerns over uh the language around
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
poultry and poultry products is this
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
would still allow foods that we consider
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous such as a chicken
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
pot pie to be allowed to sell without
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
the benefit of lure and and
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
inspection um currently we have 113
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
licensed Homestead food operations in
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um as as was stated
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
the reasons why they would be required
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
to be licensed is they um are either
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
offering Foods via the Internet to
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants to wholesalers or they gross
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
more than $220,000 in sales and to be
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
honest with you in our experience it's
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
not that dollar amount that's requiring
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
those folks to be licensed it's usually
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
because they are selling VI via the
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
Internet that's like that's usually the
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
most common reason why they're seeking
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
that lure and just want to point out the
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
um this license is an $150 annual
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
license it does come with an inspection
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
um where our one of our staff goes and
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
visits that home food manufacturer talks
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
to them about um sanitizing surfaces um
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
talks about General food safety um good
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
practices we talk about um if you have
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
pets securing them away from the area
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
sanitizing all food contact surfaces
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
um Etc so we definitely were concerned
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
about the expansion of potentially
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods that this the previous
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
version of this bill would have allowed
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
um but we do also I just want to point
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
out that poultry products would still be
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
considered um potentially hazardous so
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
that would be concerning and I'm happy
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any additional questions you
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
have about Homestead lure in general
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me provide
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's your testimony that the amendment
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
to 314 mitigates some of your previous
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
testimony yes we had definitely had
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about the allowance for
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
expansion to potentially hazardous foods
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
uh the this would o we we recognize that
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
many home kitchens aren't equipped with
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
proper Refrigeration they're not requ
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
ired to have commercial equipment um
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
also when it comes to the production of
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
acidified foods there is food safety
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge that and and control points
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
that have to be hit to make sure that
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
food doesn't support um the the
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
claustrum botulinum that bacteria that
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
causes botulism so those those are have
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
always been considered high-risk
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
products um we have worked very hard
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
over the past years to come up with a
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
pathway for very lowrisk foods to be
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
made without a food license um and and
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
also there is um there is a provision
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
that consumers are aware through the
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
label that products are made in a
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
residential kitchen so we um again we
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
would not want to see this open up to
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous foods such as the
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
poultry products that are mentioned in
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
um in the current bill if you
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
submitted a
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
revised testimony email to the committee
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that we would appreciate it
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
and when this bill does go to a
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that'd appreciate it very
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
much uh does anyone have any questions
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh for Miss
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
Smith yes yes U chair recognizes
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you chairman
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.069 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
currently

00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
currently poultry products are or are
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
not salable by
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
home home
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
businesses so the current regulation and
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is allowed by USDA is for whole
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
poultry to be offered from a person's
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
Farm their own um Farm Stand or Farmers
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
Market um with that thousand bird limit
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
if it's just the the poultry products um
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
can so if someone was to for example
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
make a a chicken pot pie that's where
 
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
our concern is so they're currently
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
Allowed by us to offer whole Birds only
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
but it's just the expanded products that
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
we don't currently
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
allow thank you representative kerk had
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
his hand
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
up thank you very much um thank you for
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
being here Miss Smith I had a question I
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
think you were there apparently then for
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
my questions about the amendment and I
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
am still confused about that question of
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
removing the cap from the exemption
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
actually means that
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
now that there any person will be
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
submitted and there is no longer an
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
exemption for the low volume producer is
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
that your understanding of this
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
Bill so unfortunately I don't have a
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
copy of that Amendment so I would like
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
to um would take like to take a look at
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
that in context of the current statute
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
and and I um could comment to that after
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
that time followup please yes I I should
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
say actually in the bill itself the same
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
language was stricken um that is that uh
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
it strikes the and you knew that from
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the initial bill online too where it
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
strikes the less than the minimum annual
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
grow sales but it just seems if you
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
remove an exemption you then make these
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
persons uh liable to uh having to
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
license no matter what sales they have
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
even if they're low volume sales they'll
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
they have to sell because they're not
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
exempt is that not correct it's the same
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the bill and the amendment for that
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
piece that I'm asking by the way corre
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
correct we were we were confused about
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
that in the original the language of the
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
original bill as well because it did not
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
um exempt out those that are currently
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
exempt from a license producing only
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%

this hearing today uh for the record my
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
name is Ross Connelly I'm the deputy
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
state director for Americans for
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
Prosperity New Hampshire I'm here to
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
offer our support for
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
hb314 uh obviously there's some it
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's some issues that
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
need to be worked out with language of
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
the bill but in general we we we support
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of this
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in 2011 our state made
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
the decision to establish a two-tiered
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
system for selling homemade food
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
products uh for example if a single
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
mother decided to start selling homemade
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
cookies to make extra money she would
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
need to keep the total gross revenue
 
00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:37.790 align:start position:0%
need to keep the total gross revenue
under

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
$20,000 and she would not be able to
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
sell in retail stores or online unless
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
she acquired a
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
license currently homemade food
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
producers in New Hampshire May sell
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
baked goods like Breads and cookies
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
along with candy Dry Goods pastries jams
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
jellies and snacks
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
SS uh the process to acquire a license
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the regulations needed to comply are
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
honorous and burdensome for low-income
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs who are selling Goods that
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
have been deemed by definition and
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
limitation of what a homestead food is
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
to not be potentially hazardous food uh
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
if this product is not potentially
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
hazardous when it is produced under the
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
$20,000 limit it is not potentially
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
hazardous at $20,000
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
And1 this teed system quells
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship and holds back Granite
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
Staters from growing their local
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
business out of their home our state
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
policy should remove uh focus on
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
removing barriers that are standing in
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
the way of citizens using their talents
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
to improve their lives their families
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
and their
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
communities as we understand it this
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill simply removes the requirement to
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
acquire a license when their homemade
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
products gross revenue exceeds
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
$220,000 and allows for that very
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
important retail and online sales the
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
limitations on what is deemed a
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
homestead food or what is potentially
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous does not change much outside
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
of of of the poultry uh provision with
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
this bill uh but the UN unnecessary
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
second tier of regulations will be
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
eliminated to make it easier for
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
homebased businesses to thrive and grow
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
and at a time when many Gran Staters uh
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
have been forced to work from home as
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
many of us are today uh and food
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
distribution has been deemed a an
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
essential service it makes all the sense
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
in the world to give these entrepr
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs this uh needed regulatory
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
relief so uh with with these uh
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
grammatical changes we do urge the the
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend o to pass on on
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
hb314 and I'd be happy I I I have a
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of a time limit here but I'd
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions do any
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
Conley thank you sir for your testimony

00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:15.510 align:start position:0%
Smith who is testifying also in favor of
this

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your time my name is
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
Erica Smith and I a senior attorney at
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
Justice a national nonprofit
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%

rights
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also a legal expert on homemade food
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
laws also known as cottage food laws and
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
I assist state legislators to improve
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
these laws
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
Nationwide uh before I get into my
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
testimony I did want to clarify some
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
confusion uh obviously the bill language
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be clarified but I could speak
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
to what the intent of the bill is
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
because I think there was some
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
misinformation uh the intent of the bill
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
is to if you you are just selling shelf
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
stable Foods you no longer need a
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
license but if you want to if you have a
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
license it will allow you to sell
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
perishable foods like the pot pie the
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
mac and cheese and the pizza uh I
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
understand that there's uh concerns from
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
Health the health department about this
 
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
but other states are already doing this
 
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
and it's working very
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
successfully um so with that
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
clarification I can get into my
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
testimony which will explain the bill a
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
little bit more and the reasons to
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
support so I encourage the committee to
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill for three reasons
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
first New Hampshire's current law is
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
very restrictive compared to other
 
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
states the bill fixes this and would
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
bring New Hampshire up to speed with
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
best practices second there are no
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
safety concerns with the bill and third
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
the bill would create thousands of new
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
small businesses so to start New
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current law is very
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
restrictive right now it requires a
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
burdensome license if you want to sell
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
shelf stable Foods also known as not
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous foods uh if you
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
want to sell these Foods online to
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
retail shops for more than the
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
$20,000 sales cap uh this is in contrast
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
to many other states which don't require
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
a license at all but still allow you to
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
sell these shelf stable Foods online and
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
to retailers the majority of States also
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
do not have a sales cap the bill
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
corrects these problems it eliminates
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
the license for most types of sales and
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
eliminates the sales cap
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
completely the other problem with the
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
current law that is that it banss the
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
sale of several types of foods like
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
perishable foods perishable meals and
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
acidified foods like pickles in recent
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
years several states have changed their
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
laws to allow the sale of these Foods
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
these states include Wyoming Utah North
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
Dakota and California the bill would
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire residents to sell
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
these Foods as well I should note that
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
while most most of those states do not
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
require a license to sell perishable
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
foods uh hb314 does require a license
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
for those foods but you could still use
 
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
your home kitchen and that's the
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
essential part so with or without a
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
license though health concerns are
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
almost non-existent people are already
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
legally selling homemade foods in 49
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
States including in this one yet we've
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
yet to find a single report of someone
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
getting sick that's probably prob
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
probably because homemade food
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
businesses are generally very small
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
operations and their owners have their
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
names and reputation at stake finally
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
hb13 would help thousands of people
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
support themselves their families and
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
their farms at The Institute for justice
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
we' have studied the economic effects of
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
these laws and they're impressive for
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
example after Minnesota eased its
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions on homemade food 3,000 new
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
homemade food businesses were registered
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
and Texas saw a similar development
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
after it eased up its
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions additionally studies show
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
that lower income women living in rural
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
areas are the most likely to benefit
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
from these laws which is great because
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of other economic
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities this bill would also help
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
chefs restaurant workers and others
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
start homade businesses during the
 
00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic while they're out of work also
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
benefiting our stay-at home parents
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities Farmers
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
military spouses and retirees all people
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
who want or need the flexibility to work
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
from home in conclusion I urge the
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
committee to support the bill and I'm
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:34.510 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
representative

00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
something we could tell from a pink card
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
but I don't know how much of the pink
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
card information our clerk has are you a

Bixby sorry representative Peter Bixby
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%

okay so for the record I'm
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Bixby straford
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
District 17 in Dober New Hampshire and I
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
am the ranking member of the House
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
environmental and agriculture
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee and uh I have been uh involved
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
with a number of uh small changes to
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
this law uh since I became me uh uh
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative in uh
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
2012 uh and uh so I'm I'm fairly
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with the history of it uh the
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of the uh exemption is
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
essentially to make it possible for uh
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
people who are either hobby producers or
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
who are just getting started to uh get
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
started without the Burden Burden of a
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
license uh the cap on this bill the the
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh sales cap was originally 10,000
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh in um I believe it was 2014
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
we raised it to
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
$20,000 uh originally one was not
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell to retail establishments
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh we made we uh we made possible to
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
sell to retail establishments in
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
2015 uh because uh there were a there
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
were people who wanted to be able to uh
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
produce their products and then sell a
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
sell at someone else's Farmstand or at a
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
small local business uh so we have uh
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
essentially made the made it more uh
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
permissive as time goes on uh but the
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
the point of the cap is that if you are
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
producing Beyond a certain level you
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
need to actually have a better a larger
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh operation a larger capacity which is
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
often not available in a home kitchen uh
 
00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
often not available in a home kitchen uh
so

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh in order to uh make sure that people
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
are uh produ are producing an
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh situation or appropriate
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
setup uh We've we think that the lure
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense Beyond a certain production
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
level uh and that's consistent with what
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
with the testimony we've heard over the
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
years from uh Health and Human Services
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
I was initially very concerned about
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
this bill because of it looked like it
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
was going to be allowing hazardous food
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
or potentially hazardous food and uh
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that that problem has
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
been been eliminated um I would
 
00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:06.039 align:start position:0%
recommend rather than eliminating the
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
cap alog together go with what we
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
actually passed in our committee last
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
year which was to raise the cap to
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
35,000 which took into account an
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the cost of
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
ingredients uh and uh I'm glad that the
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh the pro the CRI sponsor was not
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
intending to allow meat under this uh
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
because that is potentially hazardous
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
and also is uh regulated by federal law
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh in ways that we don't want to get
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
into as for the poultry end of things uh
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
we actually have uh the most permissive
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
poultry sales uh legis uh laws that we
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
can under federal law already in RSA 427
 
00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
2A Roman 3 sorry so kind of wrapping up
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
B do you
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
understand am I am I am I talking too
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
quickly uh point of order Mr chair would
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
you please tell representative snow to
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
mute his microphone oh thank the
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
lorda snow you must mute we can hear
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so um do I need was I
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
audible do I need to repeat anything oh
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
you're good you're very good okay
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
so um so uh so I would recommend that
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
the poultry part of this be struck
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
anything uh because basically we already
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
have the maximum amount of uh permission
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
possible under federal law for uh home
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
for Homestead sales of poultry under 427
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
colon 2 uh and I would recommend rather
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
than completely limiting the cap raising
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
the cap to
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
35,000 and so when someone gets to that
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
level it really makes sense for them to
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
be able to to to be inspected and to get
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
the advantage of advice from the
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
food protection um as to what other
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
states do I'm not I haven't done a
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
thorough sample of all other states I do
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
have a friend who is doing home uh
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
Homestead production in Maine and she
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
was actually very surprised that New
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire didn't require any lure uh at
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
at a low level uh she is producing well
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
under what our
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
um our $20,000 cap and she was Rec
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
required because she was doing it at all
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
in Maine to get inspected and it was and
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
she found that inspection actually
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
rather helpful because she got good
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
advice in terms of uh practice you good
 
01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
practices um I think that uh our our
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
exemption for that low level makes sense
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
I think that once you get up to a
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
certain level uh the license the $150
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
license with inspection if uh you are
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
producing over $35,000 worth is a
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
relatively small business expense and uh
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to uh maintain that uh
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
lure at that at that level and
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby um at what point do
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
people have to have
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
um kitchens that satisfy requirements
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
like triple sinks
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
Etc uh the um I I don't I'm not
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
thoroughly versed in the um
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
in in the uh food protection um
 
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
regulations I think that uh uh um
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith from food protected
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
services could probably uh provide a
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
better answer for that uh but in terms
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
of uh when you are required to have
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
certain equipment it is certainly is not
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
you are not required to have that below
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
the cap level and it is possible in uh
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
that a home kitchen could be
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
sufficiently equipped uh for the to get
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
the license even if um without any
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
without major Renovations you don't need
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
to you even even even at the licensed
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
level uh you are talking about a home
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
kitchen you are not talking about a
 
01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:47.190 align:start position:0%
kitchen you are not talking about a
commercial

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative bxby and once
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%

you and the final one to uh bring
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
McLoud can you hear me now
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh yes uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify um there's been
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh obviously a big change in this bill
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
um and I'm testifying uh for the record
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
I my name is Thomas mlar I live in
 
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
Mountain Vernon uh my wife and I uh
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
would like to have a um homebased uh
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
food production business um currently
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're experimenting with different
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
products um as I understand it uh and I
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the uh amended language as
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
I understand that this bill would would
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
allow us
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
to uh use our home kitchen for uh
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
fermented uh certain fermented foods uh
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
which we would not be able to uh do
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
Under the uh under exist existing law um
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
I had prepared um more things to say uh
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
regarding the original language um but
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
since that apparently has been
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
struck uh I'm going to leave it at that
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we we as I understand it we I do
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
support the bill in the current form uh
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I think there's more work to do on
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
it and with that I'll uh end my
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr McLoud and with
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
that I am bringing to a close this
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
hearing I will name a subcommittee which
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
is neither of the two big subcommittees
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
all of you signed up for but because
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a different thing Al
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
together and while I have everybody's
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
attention just to let you know future
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
meetings of this committee I was told
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday will be on the 1st of February
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
we already know that it's been noticed
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
that's a Monday and then Tuesday the
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
second of
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
February and then the 8th of February
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
which is also a Monday and after that
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're still working it
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
out so could we take about a minute and
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
a half stretch and breathe break before
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
over because you can do that you ask for
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
the expertise of another
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:32.430 align:start position:0%
the expertise of another
commit

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
M be careful of the
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%

stuff as long as we have you here you
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
know what you could do is keep yourself
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
muted all the time and when you want to
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
speak just hold down the space bar on
 
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.430 align:start position:0%
speak just hold down the space bar on
your

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
keyboard oh I didn't know that oh
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay Ken that's what I do that's that's
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
a good way to do it all right I didn't
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
know I didn't know that was an
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
option time to discover it in some
 
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.950 align:start position:0%
option time to discover it in some
embarrassing

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
moments so you keep the space bar down
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
if you hold the space bar down it you
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
and then when you let it out
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
to yeah when when you're muted the space
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
bar becomes a push to talk
 
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.669 align:start position:0%
bar becomes a push to talk
button

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
selecting and U helping the alternative
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
centers to find locations and and all
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
the rules um that were involved in that
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
and um then finally in
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
2018 the um the council issued a an
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
advisory that the uh the pro there were
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
no problems with the um operation of the
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and they
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
issued the the the uh an opinion that
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
the program should continue so uh in
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
essence we look at it is that they they
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
have accomplished the goals of the
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
original legislation and therefore we're
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
looking to repeal it now what what has
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
happened is that we now have the medical
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
oversight board which is active and um
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
providing consult uh to our committee
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
and and to health health and human
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
services on uh the next phase which is
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with the med the medical
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
conditions that are allowed and so forth
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
so we feel that the uh the therapeutic
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
use of Canabis advisory Council has
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
accomplished its Mission and therefore
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
should be struck from the original Law
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the goal of this legislation
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative I'm
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to move immediately to call on
 
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
going to move immediately to call on
representative

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
McKay who can bring some history and
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
perspective to this sir than you Mr
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um would you
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
believe that I was chairman front of
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
that commission for five years it was
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
essential and representative act has
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
done a great job and and uh was uh
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
positive and hasn't always been positive
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
the comments about our organization it
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
had some very diverse
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
populations essentially we were to work
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
to advise the Department of Health and
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services about the beginning and
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
structural steps to start the medical
 
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
structural steps to start the medical
marijuana

01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
program U representative Nelson was also
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
a member of
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
that commission u in essence to make
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
this very brief that we've done our job
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh the medical marijuana program is
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
strong and moving along and and
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
developing uh there is no need for the
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee to continue to
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
particular because the the committee
 
01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
that representative coner is I don't
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
know if he's chairman or vice chairman
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
is dealing with the treatability issues
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
which are very complicated as to whether
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
or not medical marijuana is useful for
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of conditions so that's in
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
very good hands uh so therefore I
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
strongly support that uh we uh support
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation and put that committee
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%

131 I think yeah relative to reporting
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
of Health Care Associated infections and
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative woodmar committee is the
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor would you introduce the
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
bill sir uh thank you Mr chair uh yes
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
I'll um this is very straightforward
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
again um I'll be very brief and
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
summarize as there's several people from
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
the affected agencies that can provide
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
technical details if
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
necessary uh in essence uh this brings
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
um uh the testing and Reporting up to
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
datee um uh and also uh revises uh the
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
standards by which uh measures uh are
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
examined um specifically uh the um some
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
of the tests some of of the uh reporting
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
that's done uh is done to make sure that
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
the particular facilities either
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals Day Surgery centers nursing
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
homes uh meet certain standards um and
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
once they reach those standards which
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
they have have done in this particular
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
situation relative to uh central line
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
practices and surgical antimicrobial
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
prophylaxis uh then it's no longer
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
needed to report uh both the uh
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
infection rates and the process by which
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
they're monitoring it uh this bill um
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
would uh change that such that uh the uh
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate uh reviews still look at
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
these excuse me still look at these
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
issues which are important uh but the
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
reporting they don't have to report uh
 
01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
sort of the protocols if you like uh so
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
that it's a simpler administrative
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
process for them uh and relieve some of
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
the administrative burden um uh the uh
 
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh second part of the bill uh brings
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
it up to date in terms of uh identifying
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
the appropriate agencies CDC
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
CMS um hospital and um reporting systems
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh the National Quality Forum uh that
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
are uh appropriate for the particular uh
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
Day Surgery Center hospital nursing home
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh agencies that oversee them and it
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
brings them up to those standards and
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
identifies that those are the standards
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
that will be met um the only other thing
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
that it adds is that um you'll see uh at
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
the uh in section four uh uh reporting
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
infections it adds measures um and
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
that's again just consistent with what's
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh the reporting process is now across
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
the board um finally uh at the uh line
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
28 uh they you'll notice that there is a
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
strike out of accreditation of
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare organizations uh that's the
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
the new name for the Joint Commission
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
which most of us in the medical area are
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with For Better or For
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
Worse um uh one just uh last uh sidebar
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh you'll notice that on line 30 it says
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Health Care quality and
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
safety commission uh notice that it's
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
the uh uh item is not capitalized I was
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
advised by OS uh that federal agencies
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
are capitalized state agenc or not uh so
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
um I I learned something there so
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
basically this is just bringing uh up to
 
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
dat uh the uh reporting uh criteria uh
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the U agency and federal agencies uh
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
that provide the standards by which
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
those reportings will be
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
reviewed um so in a sense um it's um
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
just bringing things up to date uh and
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
again reassuring that the healthcare fa
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
facilities really are meeting the
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
standards we expect uh for our citizens
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you you prepared
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh I'll try but again
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
there are I think there are some folks
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
if there are real technical issues I'll
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to defer
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative gay thank you Mr
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
question um it sounds like this is a
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh Bill to bring us up to
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
current Uh current procedure and current
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
reporting excuse
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
me I just have one question about what
 
01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
the wording means the coverage rates of
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination for Health Care
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel does that mean like in this
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital what percentage of people have
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
taken the
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
shot uh uh that would be my
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation it says coverage rates uh
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
so my sense is that there that the
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
facility then would have to look at that
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
issue of how many do in fact have that
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
particular um um
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination follow follow up uh so is
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
that a a federal requirement they try to
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
track it would fit with that I'm not
 
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
sure how the databases uh are U are
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
interfaced uh that gets very complex uh
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
but um I'm I know that they do I just
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how uh they're interfaced
 
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone else can ask answer that
 
01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.470 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone else can ask answer that
more

01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
technically Mr chairman representative
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
Marsh thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Dr Woods it's a
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
pleasure hearing you again on this issue
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and I would like you to clarify
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
some things for me it's my understanding
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
that the continuous quality improvement
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
initiative that the the hospitals
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
participate in including my Hospital of
 
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
which I am a trustee uh began with a
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
number of measures which hospitals
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
overall were rather deficient in
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
including the two measures that you're
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
striking here the adherence rate of
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
central line insertions and surgical
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial prophylaxis and that those
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives resulted in the hospitals
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
now universally Meeting those standards
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
and by the original idea it's time to
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
remove those standards and replace them
 
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
with new ones so that we achieve the
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
goal of continuous quality improvement
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
am I correct in that well no I I think
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
there's a misunderstanding if you look
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
at the RSA it doesn't re remove the
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
reporting okay that those are still
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
reported it's just that they actual have
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
the the part that's being removed as as
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
it it says it's uh they report the
 
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.430 align:start position:0%
it it says it's uh they report the
process

01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
measures so if you look at just above in
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
the original RSA 151 uh colon 30 3 uh a
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh 2A it says though there will still be
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
reported so we'll still be able to
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
monitor it so those will be just
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
reported as numbers but the hospital
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to provide the uh U overall
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
processing that they used to uh address
 
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.510 align:start position:0%
processing that they used to uh address
that

01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
issue follow up Mr chairman follow up
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah is it not true that those two
 
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
measures are no longer the measures on
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
which hospitals are scored under cqi
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh I can't tell you the details about
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the numbers I do know that the
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and the uh following these are
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
are quite high and U there there are
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
people that provided testimony to the
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee that provided the numbers and
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
it's up in the
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
98% uh level of uh compliance uh with
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
these uh and um with this process uh so
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
it is has been quite good been as you
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
noted has been very successful um and
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh again it's just uh removing
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
the ACT additional administrative part
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
of of demonstrating the process besides
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
just the numbers yes and thank you and
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman one last followup please go
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
ahead is it true that this bill makes no
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
change whatsoever in the reporting about
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
correct I thank you any technical
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions be held because we will have a
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
speaker in a minute who will be able to
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
address them but first I would like to

members for the opportunity to speak to
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
this bill today and what I would like to

say is I very I well I'm Laura Condon
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
from Bedford um I would like to say that
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the efforts to track and
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
control Hospital acquired infections we
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
know that hospitals and other medical
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
facilities are germy places if you will
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
um where many people who enter such
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
facilities uh without infections
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
thereafter acquire infections and this
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
is uh a national problem that you know I
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate we all appreciate the
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
attention to um mitigate that I would um
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
bring to the attention of the committee
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill um similar to a bill
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
that was introduced last year the bill
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
that was introduced last year was House
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
Bill uh
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
1246 what this bill does is it adds
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
language and that bill was defeated what
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it adds language which
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
is concerning and that's why I speak
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
today um I recognize that um that there
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
still will be recording requirements for
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
certain mitigation efforts and infection
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
measures I mean infection rates but what
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerns me is the added language of
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
measures measures is actually not
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
defined in this statute but the way that
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's written it certainly would lead you
 
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
to believe whatever measures are taken
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
to mitigate infections um including
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
because it's listed is influenza
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination and so by the language of
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
the this law that would include any
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
other measures that might fall under
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination now being is required to
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
required to be tracked and
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
reported and so the concern here to me
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
is that this measures language added um
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
would include the tracking and reporting
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
of all vaccination measures not just the
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
one itemized here because has taken away
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
itemizations and adding in this broad
 
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
language which essentially could result
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
in a backdoor vaccine um tracking and
 
01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
Reporting registry somewhere gosh knows
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
where it goes to these Federal databases
 
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
of uh Hospital uh healthcare workers
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
patients and residents an involuntary uh
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
tracking and Reporting System so for
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
that reason that added language was not
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
there last year um I was not concerned
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
with the bill last year I do have these
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
concerns now with that additional
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
language and so for that reason I do ask
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
that the committee uh please oppose this
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much for the
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%

technical questions and I would I will
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
defer to her in a minute um I do want to
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank representative Woods for
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill in it its exact
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
form um I just wanted to state that for
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
the record this is as representative
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
Weber indicated the same exact language
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
that was passed in the committee last
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
year and thank you representative Woods
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
for reintroducing it it did pass your
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
committee it passed the Full House and
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
it actually was heard in the Senate But
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately did not get signed into law
 
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
because as you know um due to the
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic with the um Omnibus Senate
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
bills um this this this was used as a
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle last year's Bill and ultimately
 
01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
was not was not signed into law had
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
nothing to do actually with this bill um
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
we worked with the department and
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative woods and the committee
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
last year to um get the bill that you
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
see in front of you this year um passed
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
um so again um the department was HHS I
 
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
believe they are available to to answer
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
any questions as well and I am going to
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
defer um to Ann defendorf at this point
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
because um she really is the one that
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
works with our quality directors at the
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals um in our infection control um
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
Specialists um to answer any particular
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
questions but I just want to be on the
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
record indicate this was the exact same
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
language we went word for word to make
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
sure there were no changes to make it um
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
easy for easier um to understand that
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
this was we were just reintroducing the
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
same bill um could I ask an to raise her
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
hand if that would be acceptable to the
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
chair and so that she can um also
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
testify go
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:34:03.390 align:start position:0%
testify go
ahead

01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
hello this is
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
an you hear
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
me okay um I just wanted to reference in
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
terms of some of the questions earlier
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to the measures that we
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
asking to be removed one is the surgical
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
Care Improvement project those were
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
measures that are no longer reported
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere they were considered obsolete a
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
few years ago because they were so based
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
in strong evidence that there were no
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions of people adhering to them and
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
the other one the central line insertion
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
practices is no longer reported anywhere
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
and they're again strongly embedded in
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals will you take
 
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.950 align:start position:0%
hospitals will you take
question

01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you my my question is
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
actually uh rep uh directed to
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative woods so Mr chairman I
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you'd like me to ask that
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
now or wait well I'm going to bring
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative Woods back because I uh
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
moved a little too quickly from
 
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
representative woods and couldn't see
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
Hands in the top of my screen so yes uh
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative Woods if you would uh be
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
willing to take some questions more
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions yeah sure I'll I'll do my best
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt you may
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
proceed so um yeah so so this Echoes a
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
comment that was made in testimony a
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
moment ago um by uh by a previous uh
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
person I guess my my concern is the
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
language in section three which appears
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
to essentially defer State oversight of
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
U of some of these metrics and hand that
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
over to uh to
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
to Federal and quas governmental
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
authorities and I guess my concern there
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
um is is that use of the word and or the
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
phrase and measures which I I think
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
opens us up to a pretty broad
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
um a a a pretty broad uh set of
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
potential requirements that are you know
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
that were never decided or overseen by
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
um by the state of New Hampshire U
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislature or executive branch so I'm
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm interested in hearing your
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
response to that why we've included
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
language that um that that you know
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
spells out specifically the the
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
technical advisers to be consulted I
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
have less of a problem with that I have
 
01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about the latter
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
section um in in what has been described
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
as a as a kind of housekeeping measure
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
but um seems to be handing over uh quite
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
a bit of State um State Control to uh to
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
to agencies that are not elected or
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
accountable to New Hampshire uh to New
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters can you respond to that
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
sure um I'll do my best but I think part
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
of it I would like to refer to an
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
deindorfer for part of it and I'll get
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
that in a second um in section there's
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
two parts section three um reference to
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
the Centers for Disease Control Etc uh
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're not turning over control to them
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's simply states that uh the
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
amator uh in consultation with technical
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
advisers in other words these are
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
standards that have been evolved over
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
the course of time at uh at one point U
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
many of the hospitals and many of the
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
states had their own criteria establish
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
their own criteria uh that became
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat honorous uh as medicine became
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
much more uh fractured fragmented
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
complex uh those standards uh became uh
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
harder to
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
identify um and as a consequence um uh
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh the different agencies uh turned
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
to uh other people that had expertise in
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
that realm again um that provided a
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
standard uh Across the Nation uh but
 
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's a as you'll not it this is not
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
turning over control to them uh but this
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
is indeed in in consultation with
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
technical advisers so um these are just
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
what when the state does this uh this is
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
only looking to them for advice um and
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
they may accept them as standards uh
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
after review um uh on on the second part
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
relative to measures um uh that I'm
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
going to turn that over to an deindorfer
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
if she's still about uh to really give a
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
a very firm uh definition of what
 
01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.669 align:start position:0%
a very firm uh definition of what
measures

01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
measures
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
mean um and uh the uh differentiation
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
between uh an entity of infection versus
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
a measure relative to an infection and
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what is reported and that may
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
clarify your for you so if I could uh
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
ask Ann if she's still
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
here an yes hello I am um I I think I'm
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
going to defer to the department around
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
the word of measures they were I'm
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they added that but I would
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
just say measures is a term that often
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
our regulatory agencies are using in
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
addition to specifics of rates and
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
infections so I think we just want to
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that the bill would allow
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
additional scientific and
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
evidence-based items that would be
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
included um and I think is Abby Rogers
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Merchant had
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
think thank you m thank you Mr chair
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um in regards to the data
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's being reported or
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
collected could you speak to whether
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's aggregated data which is patient
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
identified or is this individual patient
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
level what yeah uh I can't I can't stay
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
specifically about the character of the
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
data uh I do know that a lot of it has
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
been deidentified
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
um um uh maybe I'll ask them to step up
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
again I do know a a Department of Health
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is under uh currently
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
looking at new data platforms to bring
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh desperate uh areas uh so that
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
they can communicate uh and again one of
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
the Hallmarks is that it will be uh I
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
identified so that uh have more Comfort
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
level and meet Hippa standards in a
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
strict manner um but um maybe if if
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
someone from HHS is is on again they can
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe ask uh or answer in a more
 
01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.470 align:start position:0%
maybe ask uh or answer in a more
technical

01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
technical
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
manner is Abby Rogers
 
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh on this meeting yes she is Abby
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
Rogers could you
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
answer couple bring right on

infectious disease surveillance is
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled to testify on this bill and
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%

surveillance at the division of Public
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
Health Service Services thank you for
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
having me here today I did register so I
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
apologize maybe there's some sort of
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
technical issue on my end but I will
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
look to resolve that for future
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm here today to provide
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
information and support HB 131 relative
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
to the reporting of healthcare
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
Associated infections if you prefer I
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
can answer some of those questions or I
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
can also provide my testimony and answer
 
01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
those questions further on please advise
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
what you would
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
prefer well I think we're pretty much
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
coming to the end of this if you could
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
give some brief testimony take a few
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
questions would would appreciate it
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
great all right I will do that we also
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
submitted our written testimony which
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
also provides a little bit more detail
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
one of the questions was regarding data
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
we do collect data but this is an
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
aggregate form for measures I want to
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
let the members of committee know that
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to various meas measures
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
such as health Healthcare Associated
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
infections um in influen of vaccination
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
rates it's in aggregate form some
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
measures are in individual form but it's
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
all deidentified through a CDC webbased
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
secure system and there it is in a way
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
that in a mechanism that you cannot
 
01:43:56.639 --> 01:43:58.589 align:start position:0%
that in a mechanism that you cannot
identify

01:43:58.589 --> 01:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and I am going to provide uh
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of my testimony and a little
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
bit of background as well to these
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
measures if this if it will assist the
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee Healthcare associate infection
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%

there were 197 such infections reported
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire reported in New
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals hey excuse me uh
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
people are having trouble understanding
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
you could you speak a little more slowly
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
please oh sure is this better and clear
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
better all right I apologize thank you
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
for stopping me I appreciate
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
that Healthcare associate infections are
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
a leading cause of death in the US and
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
certain ones are required to be reported
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
to the Department New Hampshire by New
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals and Ambulatory
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers in 2018 for context
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
197 infections that we reported in
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
addition to certain infections hospitals
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers and dialysis
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
centers also have to report some
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
preventative measures put in place to
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
protect patients in this this is where
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
that measures piece within that bill is
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
is referenced to it's preventative
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
measures to prevent Healthcare associate
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
infections these include Healthcare
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel influenza vaccination surgical
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
care um antibiotic prophylaxis and
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
central line insertion practices in
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals um they report central line
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
assertion practices and surgical
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial prophylaxis under the

Improvement project this bill seeks to
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
remove those measures um for several
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
reason reasons the clip monitoring
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
assesses key infection prevention
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
practices that occur during the
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
insertion of a central line such as
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
performing hand hygiene and wearing
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
gloves since the start of reporting of
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
this measure in New Hampshire hospitals
 
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
have improved and maintained High
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
adherence to recommended insertion
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%

2018 surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
is the administration of antibiotics
 
01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
prior to surgical procedure to prevent
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
surgical sight infections monitoring
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate administration of these
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
antibiotics was initially included in
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
the reporting law over 10 years ago
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
because all hospitals already had to
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
report this measure via the centers for
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services through
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
the surgical Care Improvement project
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS collected data from CMS instead of
 
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
from hospitals directly however after
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
2013 CMS dis continued collection of
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
these data and hospitals are no longer
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
required to report this measure at the
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
federal level in the final year that
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS had access to these data Hospital
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
adherance to best practices with similar
 
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
or higher than National Data for all
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
98% for NE Hampshire um I can provide
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
more details for each of those measures
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
but for example um one of them measure
 
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.270 align:start position:0%
but for example um one of them measure
two

01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
was uh yes uh representative kushman
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank Mr
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for my question um
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
although the data is collected in
 
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
aggregate it requires um the data on
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual healthare workers to be
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
collected by employee employers by
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
adding this broad term measures if the
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
CDC or one of the other agencies um
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
changes their recommendations and say
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's best practice to Monitor and track
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates of healthcare
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
employees for vaccines other than
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
influenza which is the only one that's
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
explicitly mentioned in this
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
statute could then and would like then
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
the department update their measures to
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
require New Hampshire facilities um to
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
track rates of other vaccinations be
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
workers and may I speak to this question
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
this is Katrina
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hansen so the right now the statute and
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
the and the rules specifically mentioned
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination we are not
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
requesting access for other vaccination
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
information for healthcare workers so
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
right now it's solely influenza
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
vaccination for healthcare workers and
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
we're only requesting uh aggregate data
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
and then also for tracking of it not
 
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.270 align:start position:0%
and then also for tracking of it not
requiring

01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
it and we are go
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
ahead um well so my other question is
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to um miss this is
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
for Mr Woods I guess um to amend this
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill to clarify what measures are and um
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
to state that it does not it won't apply
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
to um other vaccination rates besides
 
01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
influenza and healthcare workers unless
 
01:49:08.189 --> 01:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
RSA I think we could I could um I could
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
consider those um in discussion with HHS
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and see what implications that might
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
come of that um um so I wouldn't say I
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
would um categorically insert those or
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
take anything out uh without discussing
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
it to see what the ramifications might
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
be thank you any other questions
 
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.669 align:start position:0%
be thank you any other questions
um

01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
I've been told there's somebody else
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
who's not on the witness list and I will
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
allow um Courtney Tanner and uh would
 
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
ask you please to be brief are you for
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
or against the bill and if so why or why
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
not Courtney Tanner hi chairman Pi
 
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
Pearson this is Courtney Tanner I'm the

01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
this bill last legislative session I

dth Hitchcock is in support strong
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and she can provide
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
some practical information about this
 
01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
some practical information about this
bill

01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
up uh good
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
morning um thank you for the opportunity
 
01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
to testify uh today my name is Alissa
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
Malcolm I'm the director of value
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
reporting and analytics at dmouth
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock my role includes
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for all of the external
 
01:50:51.069 --> 01:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
Quality Reporting for Dart with back
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
including infection reporting to the
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um additionally
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
since 2011 I've been a member of the
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%

provides scientific and infection
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
prevention expertise to the hii program
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I spoke last year in support of this
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
bill so if my testimony today sounds
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
familiar is because I've provided it
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
before um I support hb31 not only does
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
it allow for the state to use the rules
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
process to stay current with
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
scientifically valid measures but also
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
reduces the reporting burden for
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals both the state and hospitals
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
have struggled for years on how to meet
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
the clip and Skip reporting requirements
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
as Katrina Hansen um mentioned a moment
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
ago clip um stands for central line
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
insertion practices and Skip stands for
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%

prevention over the the better part of
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
the last decade um in the technical
 
01:51:52.069 --> 01:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
Advisory workg Group we've been talking
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
about how to address the concerns with
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
the clip measure both its weakness as a
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
metric and its time intensive nature to
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
report um it's a low value measure and I
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
I want to stress that the concept of f
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
is really good the idea of a bundle of
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
actions to prevent patient harm is
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
really important but I would argue that
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
what flip measures is our ability to
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
document what has become standard
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
practice for line and
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
Sur with skip BMS retired the measures
 
01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
years ago nationally as mentioned the
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
measures had topped out meaning the
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
performance was so high and the
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
distribution so tight that meaningful
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
distinctions between hospitals could no
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
longer be measured hospitals cannot
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
continue to abstract measures when
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
definitions are not being maintained by
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
measurement science it serves neither
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire nor the
 
01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals whose performance is on
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
display this bill fixes the issues with
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
both of these measures furthermore
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
you'll note that they're both process
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
measures as as we've talked about a
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier they focus on the
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
steps in the process rather than the
 
01:52:59.390 --> 01:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
outcome or the result of the care that's
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
provided for years Medicare CMS has been
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
placing heavy focus on outcome measures
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
and moving away from process measures HB
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
131 helps line the state up with CMS
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
current practices and allows the state
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
to be flexible as infection measurement
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
changes over time through alignment with
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
CDC CMS and the national
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
qu po form measures try to stop you now
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
we've got the gist of what you've had to
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
say we appreciate it um and I am going
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
to move on on this bill and suggest that
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative Woods considers input
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
particularly representative kushman's
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
question regarding the word measures and
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Woods when you have done
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
the asking around you told us you would
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
be doing let me know please when the
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
bill will be ready to
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
exact uh thank you I will do that and
 
01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
with that I'm closing the hearing on
 
01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
with that I'm closing the hearing on
this

01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%

little bit too low um so again uh thank
 
01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair members of the committee my
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
name is Mark mlan representing Hillsboro
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
District 44 which is H Southern
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester and the town of Lichfield I'm
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
here to speak on behalf of HB 290 which
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
is a short but I think important bill
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
that acts uh as an addendum to uh the
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan direct Primary Care
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed in the last term
 
01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:00.679 align:start position:0%
basically what it's doing is taking that
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
direct payment model that was in that
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill it's extending it to Health Care
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
Facilities it simply put it states that
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
if a health care facility chose to only
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
accept uh direct payments that was their
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
exclusive form of payment they would be
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to get out from under the
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
existing law which requires them to
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
accept all forms of payment
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
now many primary care doctors including
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
my own uh found that the bureaucratic
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
burden of sorting out payments was heav
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
heavy and and costly so those that
 
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to pursue Private Practice
 
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
outside of the hospital setting the
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care model that we passed
 
01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
allowed them to choose a path that ease
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
that burden and in many cases allowed
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
them to stay in private practice and
 
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:48.679 align:start position:0%
extending the direct payment model now
 
01:56:51.149 --> 01:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
to healthcare facilities allows for
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
among other things an opportunity for
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
those providers to kind of band together
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
to provide uh an expanded canvas of
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
offerings and so those people that maybe
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
find Value in that direct payment model
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
uh with this they would have access to
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
even more services like uh lab testing
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds MRIs things of that nature
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
and I think it may even lead to an
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
increase in the services being offered
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
in the more rural areas of the state so
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
25 years ago um this is not the kind of
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
thing that really would have excited a
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
lot of patients um I know 25 years ago I
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
would never have looked at it I had
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
employer-based insurance and I was very
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
happy with that I got done what I needed
 
01:57:40.069 --> 01:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
to get done I paid a small co-pay and I
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
moved on and I didn't even think about
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
it but today is a different day and my
 
01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
deductibles are really through the roof
 
01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm not alone New Hampshire has some
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
of the highest if not the highest
 
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
deductibles in the country and partly as
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
a result of that you're starting to see
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an increase in hsas I
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it's massive um but it is
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
growing and I'm seeing more and more
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
folks in the factory that I work start
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
to take that up as an option and when
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
you add in the gig economy where lots of
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
folks are starting to work for
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
themselves and then situations where
 
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
people are working multiple small jobs
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet and maybe don't have
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
the same kind of access to the employer
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
based plans and then I think the need
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation becomes more into Focus
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
so in in many cases the direct Primary
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
Care model that we passed gave folks a
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
predictable monthly expense and this
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
bill is going to offer some of that same
 
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
level of predictability for simple
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
procedures and other offerings and The
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
Upfront nature of the pricing really I
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
think creates incredible transparency
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
here coming outside of the reimbursement
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
model and that's going to allow
 
01:58:59.470 --> 01:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
consumers to plan and more importantly
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
have confidence in their plan so in the
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
past that lack of confidence might have
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
led people to shy away from the care
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
that you know they might have had I
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what this is going to hit can
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
we really kind of go down that path but
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
with the passing of HB 290 a growing
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
number of of uh residents they're going
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
to have new options maybe some new
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
confidence and it might just work for
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
them so I hope that you will support
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
passage of HB
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
290 and that's my
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative mlan are there any
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
him I'm sorry
 
01:59:42.030 --> 01:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
represent see you thank you
 
01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:46.709 align:start position:0%
represent see you thank you
representative

01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
kerk sorry I was not unmuted I wasn't
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
expecting I thought the Dr
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh had his hand up
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
before me so I wasn't expecting that um
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I was
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
curious if you can explain to us what
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
you would expect the effect will be on
 
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals and other
 
02:00:09.629 --> 02:00:09.639 align:start position:0%
small facilities that are licensed and
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
accepting all patients as a result of
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
siphoning off the high-paying business
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me whether you think
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
that the critical access hospitals will
 
02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:20.870 align:start position:0%
that the critical access hospitals will
survive

02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
survive
 
02:00:24.669 --> 02:00:24.679 align:start position:0%
this well um I
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
I I I was looking for the the takeup
 
02:00:30.910 --> 02:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
data coming off of the the direct
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
primary care and looking at other states
 
02:00:37.069 --> 02:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
just to try to see if I could look at is
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
there some hard data that I could
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
present because I would anticipate that
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
question and unfortunately I wasn't able
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
to really find anything
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
but what I have seen because because
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's not massive and there's not a l
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
data I don't think that the takeup rate
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
on this is very high I think the the
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
bulk of people um still are either on
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid or they still have the
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
employer-based insurance so for a lot of
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
those people um I think that the uh the
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
hospital root the traditional form of
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
care is still going to be um more
 
02:01:16.830 --> 02:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial to them U but I think you
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
know down the road I don't know as a
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
dedu Ables continue to increase um you
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
know that that may change but one of the
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
things that that this may do because of
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
the nature of the transparency of of the
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
pricing is it may actually start to have
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
some lowering of the prices in the
 
02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals but I don't have hard data
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
that would tell me one way or another
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.669 --> 02:01:44.679 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
followup yep yes U Mr chair man follow
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
up yes okay
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
so my concern is since currently various
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
licensed facilities are sharing the
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
burden of the low-paying customers when
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
you sci-fi off the high-paying customers
 
02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh can you not conceive that that may
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
have an effect on the viability of our
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals that have
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
margins running often a percent or less
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
or in the
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
red if if you suddenly saw a massive
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
takeup on this um I think that that
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
could be possible but the reality is
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
when I'm going around and I'm doing the
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
literature research I'm not seeing any
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
of that happening in in other parts of
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
the country and I just know when I from
 
02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
my own experience when I talked to the
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
people that I have working with me in
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
the factory we've introduced hsas for
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
example for a long long time and they
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
really haven't been taken up with any
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
real uh degree is a percentage of the
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
plans being chosen so I really don't
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
think my God is telling me that there's
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
not going to be a lot of penetration
 
02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
when this first comes in employer-based
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh insurance is still uh the way most
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
people are going to be accessing and
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
there I think in most cases insulated
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
from the cost so they are going to go
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
model thank you uh representative Marsh
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
02:03:26.669 --> 02:03:26.679 align:start position:0%
question and as you know I'm a supporter
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
was my direct primary care bill we
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
passed last session uh I uh support
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
transparency and healthc Care pricing
 
02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
and and note from the data that you're
 
02:03:37.069 --> 02:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
correct that that has resulted in
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma where the uh Surgery Center of
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma's transparency has resulted in
 
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
decreased prices on some surgical
 
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
procedures in the state of Oklahoma but
 
02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask you if there is any
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
relationship ship between the expansion
 
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
of the surgery center of Oklahoma which
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
is the model upon which this legislation
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
is based and the closure of eight
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals in Oklahoma between 2010 and
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
2020 those being epic Medical Center in
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
eufala Latimer County General Hospital
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%

sah community hospital and hasell County

Community Hospital in Stigler thank you
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
um I really don't know why those
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals Clos so I I don't have the
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals anyone else wish to ask a
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
question represent mer thank you Mr
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
chairman representative m is it what is
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
what um sort of customer
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
is the typical kind that you would see
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
utilizing this um model payment would it
 
02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
be would it be correct to assume it
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be people who do not have employer
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
um insurance through their employer and
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
also don't have Medicaid so maybe they
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
fall in
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
between um you know they're
 
02:05:17.069 --> 02:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
underinsured yeah I mean I think
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's that's kind of what's
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
driving this legislation is it it's a
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
recognition that we have certain
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
limitations around access as well um you
 
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
know for for people who are in the gig
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
economy for people who have multiple
 
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
jobs like I said don't have
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
access the same amount of access to
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
those employer based plans they're
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
really vulnerable and they're looking
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
for some transparency and the ability to
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
plan so this um works well I think for
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
them and also I think where it may work
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
well is in rural communities um rural
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
communities um really have a real
 
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
problem with respect to asset if you
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
look at the last census I think um about
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
20% of of the country is rural but if
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
you look at the amount of doctors that
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
are serving in those rural areas um it's
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
less than 10% so there's a real access
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
issue which I I think um the direct
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
primary care bill you know helped to
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
address and I think this just Builds on
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
that by allowing those people to offer
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
more services um it goes and I think it
 
02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
improves access uh in those rural areas
 
02:06:37.069 --> 02:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
also for people in the G economy and
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
things like I said and I I really don't
 
02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
want to be going after uh hospitals and
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
closing hospitals especially not rural
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh that that would be the last
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
thing I want but understanding the
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
issues of access that we have um I think
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
we we have to recognize that just going
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
up and beefing up the hospitals you know
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that we've been trying
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
to do that and and I don't think the
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
sole solution is going to come from that
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
and so we have to be looking at at other
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
other options as well and and this is
 
02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.709 align:start position:0%
other options as well and and this is
one

02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
I other questions uh representative gay
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman excuse me thank
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
you representative um I have actually
 
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
three questions the two or definitions
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
I'll ask at the end the hard one
 
02:07:34.510 --> 02:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
is um if I'm understanding you correctly
 
02:07:37.229 --> 02:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
the bill would make things
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
cheaper because the the uh provider
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
would not have to pay for the staff to
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
do all the paperwork to deal with the
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
insurers uh I have a friend who's an
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
expert at that just a question just a
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
question so is is that the point that
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
this would be a benefit to the people
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
who have no insurance are not covered by
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
a government
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
agency that it would actually be
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
cheaper because right now if they're
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
build they're build much higher at least
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
in my experience the the retail price is
 
02:08:21.549 --> 02:08:21.559 align:start position:0%
much higher than what they agree with
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
insurers to pay um you know it it it may
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
be cheaper that's the thinking about it
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
um and it will also be more predictable
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
and and so in the case of my primary
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
care physician who chose to go the
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
direct Primary Care model on this P she
 
02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to have her own practice she
 
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to be outside from Under the
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
Umbrella of a hospital this allowed her
 
02:08:49.629 --> 02:08:49.639 align:start position:0%
to do that because she didn't have this
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
whole infrastructure that was required
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
you know with the insurance and the
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare models and and all of those
 
02:08:59.310 --> 02:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
things um and it did allow for her to
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
really drive the price down but it also
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's not just that the price is lower
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
but is that it it's predictable and so
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
um so it allows people to go places
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
maybe where there's not a hospital
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
Network to support them in the rural
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
area but it allowed you to do it so that
 
02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
I can for to be in practice and I can
 
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
pass that on to my patients and they
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
have predictability so that's that's my
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
thinking of it you said you had another
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
question yeah I wanted to know the
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
HSA and direct Primary
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
Care uh new on this committee oh um well
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh the the direct Primary Care is
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
primary care where you're providing care
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
directly to to uh the patient there's no
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model so in the case of um
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
my primary care doctor she just would
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
set up a subscription service you pay x
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money a month and you have
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
unlimited service and you're uh and the
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh what the HSA that was your other
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
question the HSA is just the health
 
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
savings accounts so um my wife and I we
 
02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
still have a PO plan which is a
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
traditional plan but with a health
 
02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
savings account you can go and instead
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
the money goes into an account which you
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
can use for routine procedures and if
 
02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
you don't use it you you you get to keep
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
that money so
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
um so for some people that don't have a
 
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.069 align:start position:0%
um so for some people that don't have a
huge

02:10:35.069 --> 02:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
huge
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
amount that that kind of works for them
 
02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
um so I hope I answered your
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
question anyone
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
else anyone else representative Merchant
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
has hand up representative
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and also
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
question I have two interrelated
 
02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
questions um question
 
02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.559 align:start position:0%
one is this really for patients without
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance and say that somebody
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
who has under Insurance still Insurance
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
way to see it so we looking for an
 
02:11:14.669 --> 02:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
audience that doesn't have any health
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
insurance and only has an H H HSA
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
account or are we talking about
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
both um it it could be utilized by
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
anybody um you know uh it could be
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
utilized by a person who has Insurance a
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
person who has HSA a person who has no
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
insurance anybody that wanted to utilize
 
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the those services at a facility
 
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
that offers that could use it um because
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's very hard I think to cost compare
 
02:11:53.069 --> 02:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
um if you had a full employer based plan
 
02:11:55.390 --> 02:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
you would probably still be going to
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
something that offers the reimbursement
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
model because it's not easy to compare
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
um what I would be paying say at CMC
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
versus what I would be paying um at a
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
clinic that would offer this and because
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
the the clinic would maybe have very
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
transparent pising because it's not a
 
02:12:16.510 --> 02:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model we all know that can
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
be sometimes hard to off offer um so
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be difficult I
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
think easily for consumers to do that
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
direct comparison it is my opinion that
 
02:12:29.790 --> 02:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
that people who are on the traditional
 
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
employer based plans for the moment
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
anyways are still going to be kind of
 
02:12:37.229 --> 02:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
going down that path um and as there's
 
02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
more transparency maybe that changes but
 
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
um but anybody would be able to use it
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I may my second question
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
would related to
 
02:12:49.870 --> 02:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
it my second question representative is
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
that in the event you have a patient
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
that has Insurance even though it's a
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
high deductible like $10,000 which is
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
common who is going to track the
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
expenses that they pay out of pocket
 
02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
because they not going back to the
 
02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company if all of a sudden
 
02:13:09.310 --> 02:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
heaven forbid they get hospitalized and
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
$50,000 how are they going to take the
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 they paid out of pocket to go
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
towards that $10,000 deductible how is
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
that process going to work so what
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying somebody that has a
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
traditional plan chose to take part of
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
their services on a direct pay mode and
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
another part of their services with the
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
more traditional Insurance mode is that
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
and and how do you know what was spent
 
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
where no how is the insurance company
 
02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
going to take the $5,000 they paid out
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
of pocket and apply that towards the
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
$10,000 deductible there's nowhere to
 
02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:45.549 align:start position:0%
$10,000 deductible there's nowhere to
track

02:13:45.549 --> 02:13:45.559 align:start position:0%
track
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
it well in in anything that you would
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
spend to uh a
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
direct to a to a clinic that only took
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
direct payments would not be counting
 
02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
towards your
 
02:14:03.149 --> 02:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
deductible that that that's something
 
02:14:05.229 --> 02:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
that exists completely outside of the
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
relationship with your insurer so to you
 
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman um I think it's
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
important if we look at this the patient
 
02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
fully understands that that $5,000 they
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
just paid out of pocket
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay again when
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
they go into the hospital because the
 
02:14:24.669 --> 02:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
$10,000 deductible is going to then
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
incur when they go into a hospital
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
admission for whatever reason so they're
 
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to double dip then and
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
double pay that's that is that is a
 
02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
double pay that's that is that is a
correct

02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
statement what what they pay to the
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
direct the direct payment facility is
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
outside of your relationship with your
 
02:14:44.189 --> 02:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
insurance thank you representative
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant for your questions do any does
 
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
then the chair will call on Greg Moore
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
who has signed up to testify in favor of
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
this bill and welcome Mr Moore and tell
 
02:15:08.549 --> 02:15:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
represent sure can you hear me yeah
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is Greg Moore I am
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state director with Americans for
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm thrilled to be here Mr
 
02:15:22.669 --> 02:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh to
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of House Bill 290 uh as
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative mlan mentioned this bill
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
Builds on the progress of the direct
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
primary care bill from two years ago
 
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
that was broadly supported we are strong
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
supporters of that model is it gives
 
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
patients an option for highquality
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
personalized patient centered care
 
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's affordable and it's also model
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
that practitioners like um this was a
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
point that was driven home to me when I
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
was at a policy conference in Colorado
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
back in October of 2019 back when we
 
02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
went to events uh and there was a panel
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
on Direct primary care I certainly was
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
interested particularly given the
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
passage of House Bill 508 and uh one of
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
the Physicians on the panel uh said of
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
direct primary care that this is why I
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
went to medical school and and got Brad
 
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
approval uh that same uh that same
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
panelist also was talking about some of
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
the challenges for passing direct
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
Primary Care he mentioned uh the
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
insurance uh the insurance Challenge and
 
02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh thankfully uh we have made that
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
change here in New stamp in New
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire two years ago but he also me
 
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of the challenges in
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with facilities and and the um
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
inability to have access to certain
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
basic facilities uh like lab work like
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
Radiology uh Medical Imaging and and
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses that uh we're
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
hopeful that this model gains traction
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
particularly as sponsor pointed out with
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
the gig economy uh creating more and
 
02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
more people who aren't necessarily
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
getting traditional employer based based
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
health insurance however you know one
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
barrier that for for long-term success
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
of direct Primary Care is lack of having
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
access to those those certain procedures
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh you could certainly Envision uh
 
02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
multiple direct Primary Care
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners coming together to form a
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
practice and then looking to add the
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
capability to do things like blood work
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
take an x-ray or or an MRI unfortunately
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
all of the those Services require a
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
facility license under state law and in
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
order to get a facility's license now
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
you were required to take all forms of
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
payment Medicare Medicaid and private
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
insurance uh when the section when the
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
section of of this bill that were
 
02:17:25.469 --> 02:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
working would be modified under this
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
current law was passed in 2016 there
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't any discussion of direct payments
 
02:17:31.950 --> 02:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
or any thought at that time of of direct
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
Primary Care the reason why that was
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
passed back in 2016 was there was a lot
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
of concern that that uh if it weren't
 
02:17:43.549 --> 02:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
put in place providers would uh spring
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
up that would take High uh high-end um
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
in what they call cherry-picking taking
 
02:17:50.669 --> 02:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
high-end reimbursement from private
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
insurance and then not taking medicaid
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh and and creating that sort of
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
imbalance that I think uh representative
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative kerk mentioned the direct
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
Primary Care model is very different
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
from a third-party payment model and
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation recognizes that fact uh
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
similar the way House Bill 508 uh did
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
two years ago what house bill 508 said
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
was is that if a provider didn't take
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
thirdparty payments that they would be
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
relieved of thirdparty payment
 
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
regulation and this bill does the exact
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
same thing just at the facility level uh
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
now to be fair no one's going to be
 
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
building a direct primary care hospital
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
nursing facility Rehabilitation Center
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
this just not the market to sustain
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
something on that scale however the
 
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
areas that I did mention earlier like as
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
I said lab work Radiology Medical
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
Imaging are places where there might be
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
a viable opportunity for uh for
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
facilities in this space and House Bill
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
290 gives us a chance to build on an
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
Innovative approach that can be a great
 
02:18:47.309 --> 02:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
fit to meet the needs of some gr estator
 
02:18:49.950 --> 02:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i' encourage uh this committee to
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
cons to strongly consider it i' I'd like
 
02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
to speak a little bit to representative
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
kerk's question which uh relates to
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals nothing in
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
this bill changes the section in RSA 151
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
that provides the 15 M radius around it
 
02:19:08.669 --> 02:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
so uh uh facilities would still this
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
would still apply to facilities within
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
the 15 mile radius so that that's still
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
in place uh and uh and and I think
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's an important uh thing to keep in
 
02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:17.950 align:start position:0%
that's an important uh thing to keep in
mind

02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
um and as to representative Mars's
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
question uh it would still I still don't
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
see a viable case for something like the
 
02:19:26.669 --> 02:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
the surgery center of Oklahoma coming to
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if with this bill passed
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
there's another section uh that was as
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
part of how Senate pill 481 back in 2016
 
02:19:37.309 --> 02:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
that says that anyone who wants a
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
hospital license and in order to have a
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
hospital license in uh in New Hampshire
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's a a facility who keeps a patient
 
02:19:46.509 --> 02:19:46.519 align:start position:0%
for more than 24 hours either needs a
 
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
hospital license or or a Skilled Nursing
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
Facility license um or or long-term care
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
be licensed under that those so um I and
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
the current law says that if you if you
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
are have to get a hospital license then
 
02:20:03.630 --> 02:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
you need to have a 247 emergency
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
department and so I just don't see a
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
case for a business model to make sense
 
02:20:11.389 --> 02:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
so I think you really are talking about
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
those types of facilities that do this
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
type work in this space like I said
 
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
Medical Imaging lab work things like
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
that so I think that's really really the
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
the uh the scope of what we would be
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
talking about if this bill were to pass
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and I'd be happy to take
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions for Mr
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
Moore representative Mar represent
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
up go ahead representative Marsh he
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Greg for
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question here uh and my
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
question relates to your statement that
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
you don't see a model for something like
 
02:20:49.469 --> 02:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
direct primary care and facilities and
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the idea of paying
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
facilities on a retainer uh By A large
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
group of people cutting out the
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
insurance middleman um would be a very
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
viable financial model and much more
 
02:21:05.550 --> 02:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
akin to the direct Primary Care model
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
than the model that's being proposed in
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill so could you address that
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
please I I I'm I'm sorry um uh maybe I
 
02:21:15.870 --> 02:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question uh
 
02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:17.370 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh
 
02:21:17.370 --> 02:21:18.790 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh
[Music]

02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase it then would it not be
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
possible to uh have a model whereby that
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
would be very comparable to the direct
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Model whereby A Health Care
 
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
System um uh took payments on retainer
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh from people who subscribe to their
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
services and then no longer build fee
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
for service to those people who paid the
 
02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
retainer on annualized basis and they
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
set the retainer fee at a rate such that
 
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
they could pay all their expenses that
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
could easily become a less expensive
 
02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
model for healthcare than than the model
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
for health care that we have today oh uh
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh we were in violent
 
02:21:57.389 --> 02:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
agreement um
 
02:21:59.230 --> 02:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in order to get a
 
02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
facility's license you have to you have
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
to take all payers and and that's sort
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the problem so the subscription model
 
02:22:08.429 --> 02:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
for that includes facilities would still
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
have the same challenge as a result of
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
this the the the section of laws that
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
currently exists um you couldn't you
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it you could not move
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
forward with that model and I and I
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
agree 100% I think that would be uh
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous cost savings a tremendous
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for more personalized
 
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
patient- centered care but it can't
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
happen uh as the current the current law
 
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
lays it
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
out a follow-up Mr chairman followup yes
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
might that perhaps be something that we
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
think about uh for filing in the
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
future we would support that
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
100% I I thank you any other
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative kofalt has his
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
kohal thank you Mr chairman uh and thank
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr Moore um you you you were talking
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
about direct primary care and and I'm
 
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you could elaborate a
 
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
little bit on the the economic model and
 
02:23:10.830 --> 02:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
sort of what are the mechanics of cost
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
savings around direct primary care and
 
02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
that would perhaps help us to better
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand the implications of this a
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely um it's important to
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
understand that um there is a enormous
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
amount of overhead that goes in place um
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
when when you um implicate third party
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
payers uh every single every single
 
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
practitioner has a small army behind
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
them of people who have to support their
 
02:23:42.269 --> 02:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
work there's a uh Physician Group uh
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
trade Association that uses as a best
 
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
practice model that for every physician
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
there should should be 2.5 full-time
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
employees just doing medical billing um
 
02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
add on to that things like revenue cycle
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
add on to that um compliance and
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
understand that that overhead that over
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
those overhead costs are mirrored on the
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the third party payer uh so for
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
example in the Medicaid Program you have
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
claims Representatives Medical Loss
 
02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
people you have uh uh Auditors and so
 
02:24:13.469 --> 02:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
that that massive overhead just sort of
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
sits a top of the the healthc care
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
system uh there was study a peer
 
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
reviewed study that came out a year ago
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
and I I think it was the anals of
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
internal medicine I'm not 100% sure
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
about that that said that 35% of health
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
care costs are overhead or $800 billion
 
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
dollar a year uh by having a direct
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
Primary Care model that sort of slices
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
through that those overhead costs and
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
and really uh Works to to ring a lot of
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of those costs out of out of
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
the the Health Care system by having a
 
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
direct payment system um the other sort
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
of factor that's that's in place that is
 
02:24:55.269 --> 02:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
a hangup um from a facility standpoint
 
02:24:57.269 --> 02:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
for the uh direct primary care beyond
 
02:25:00.269 --> 02:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
the fact you can't just offer it is that
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh that under State Medicaid laws that's
 
02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:03.910 align:start position:0%
uh that under State Medicaid laws that's
RSA

02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
126a uh you can't offer a lower price
 
02:25:10.030 --> 02:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
below your Medicaid rate so even if you
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
were able to ring all the costs out of
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
out of the overhead and say say 30% off
 
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
of what other facilities would charge if
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
that price dropped it below the price of
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid cost the Medicaid cost
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
is a floor because under state law uh
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
you uh you cannot offer a lower a lower
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
price than the Medicade price so I think
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's something uh something to
 
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
consider as well uh why this this would
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
potentially offer the opportunity for
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.670 --> 02:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
Moore thank you next up Paula minahan
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
Association who signifies she is opposed
 
02:26:02.349 --> 02:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Mr chairman again and
 
02:26:07.710 --> 02:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um again from
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
up the record Paula minahan Senior vice
 
02:26:11.309 --> 02:26:11.319 align:start position:0%
president state government relations
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
Association representing all our
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state we are opposed to
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
HB 290 we see this bill as really um
 
02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
negatively impacting access to a health
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
care facility um if they did not have
 
02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
required to have charity care policies
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
those are fundamental to ensuring that
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
all all patients regardless of their
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
ability to pay have access to care so
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know while um you know we
 
02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with the sponsor
 
02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
and Mr more um and our appro our
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
position is that charity care Pol
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
policies protect the patients especially
 
02:26:58.830 --> 02:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
those that are uninsured by having um
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
having those in place and being required
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
to have those um it was unclear to me um
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
without un I did not really understand
 
02:27:09.870 --> 02:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what the approach or the um
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill was um I understand
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
it better now after hearing the
 
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um I do want to make clear a
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
couple things one is that the state of
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire under Health Facilities I
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
listed some of the in my testimony some
 
02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the facilities that require a license
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I think it was stated that MRIs and
 
02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
Radiology requires a uh uh Li Health
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
Facilities license in our state it does
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
not I just wanted to make that point um
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
I I um understand direct Primary Care um
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not really testifying on that that
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
is a completely separ separate um Health
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
Care model um but Health Facilities
 
02:27:55.710 --> 02:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
where our hospitals are licensed um is
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
kind of my more my um my baileywick if
 
02:28:01.469 --> 02:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
you will and this this statute that is
 
02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
being amended and um impacting charity
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
care policies again that we believe um
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
impact negatively the the citizens of
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire we I I am
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
very familiar with I am very familiar
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
with the with the statute I'm very
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the with the bills that
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
were passed um addressing um trying to
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is standard um
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
coverage for all regardless of their
 
02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
ability to pay and that is a requirement
 
02:28:33.309 --> 02:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
if you get a licens um a health
 
02:28:35.389 --> 02:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
facilities license in the state of New
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and um again that's pretty
 
02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
much my testimony that I I believe very
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
strongly that um this will negatively
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
impact our patients um we do have a
 
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
hospital that is currently um in
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy in the in courts um and we as
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative kerk and others have
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
indicated um we um we have hospitals
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
including critical access hospitals that
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
um serve um our citizens um very well
 
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that they are
 
02:29:10.750 --> 02:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to take care of our
 
02:29:13.950 --> 02:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
patients um because in the North Country
 
02:29:17.469 --> 02:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
we really don't have um a lot of other
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
um services available to them so um it
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
is critical to our um patients we
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
believe in this in the state to ensure
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
that we have viable facilities um I do
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
not believe this bill is necessary I I
 
02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
am very very concerned that the way it's
 
02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
being um affecting charity care policies
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
will will have it'll be a slippy slope
 
02:29:44.110 --> 02:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
and have unintended consequences and I
 
02:29:46.269 --> 02:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
am very concerned happy to answer any
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
question questions and thank you any
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%

question uh would you agree then that
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of those unintended
 
02:30:08.309 --> 02:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
consequences would be indeed the adverse
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
Financial effect Upon Our critical
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
access hospitals leading more of them to
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps cut essential services such as
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
maternity or just have to
 
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
close um yes I would agree with that

clarify something we we remain neutral
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
on the bill but um the testimony earlier
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
regarding who this bill would um impact
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
currently the way that the statute is
 
02:31:30.349 --> 02:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
written it is only for those facilities
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
under our Suba and subd which includes
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals but it also includes
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
facilities such as um outpatient
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation clinics ambulatory
 
02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
surgical centers hospice uh emergency
 
02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
medical care centers dropin or walk-in
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
centers Di centers and burden centers
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're having trouble understanding you
 
02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:51.309 align:start position:0%
you're having trouble understanding you
it's

02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
garbled I apologize I will do my best um
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
to let me see if I
 
02:31:59.950 --> 02:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
can is this
 
02:32:03.389 --> 02:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
better well say a few
 
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
things um so the the facilities that are
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
that fall under this um provision to
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have a policy for um
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination for source of payment
 
02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:17.070 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination for source of payment
the

02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
um the hospitals hospitals are under
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
this it's it's those are that are part
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
sub a and part subd and 151 um colon 2
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
so it's hospitals also facilities that
 
02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
are outpatient Rehabilitation clinics
 
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical centers hospice
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Care Centers walk-in
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
centers dialysis centers and birthing
 
02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
centers so these are the only facilities
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
right now that are required to have such
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
a policy uh under our licensing rules
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
and um so that does not include our
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
Laboratories and Paula manahan is
 
02:32:55.389 --> 02:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
correct we do not license um
 
02:32:58.510 --> 02:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
radiological Services um under our
 
02:33:00.910 --> 02:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
health facilities the equipment is
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
licensed under Public Health but it is
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
not um it it is not licensed under RSC
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
151 which is what we are amending in
 
02:33:11.269 --> 02:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
this in this bill so I just wanted to
 
02:33:13.269 --> 02:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that I gave uh the committee
 
02:33:15.670 --> 02:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
that information for for for your
 
02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:17.349 align:start position:0%
that information for for for your
thoughts

02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone have any
 
02:33:24.190 --> 02:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber that's
 
02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay um could
 
02:33:30.269 --> 02:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
miss uh email us those points so we will
 
02:33:32.910 --> 02:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
have them in writing which will help
 
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
both the clerk and the rest of
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
us I'm happy to do so thank you that
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
that's just helpful for the references
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
to the other sections which it's hard to
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
keep up
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
with sure do anyone else have a
 
02:33:51.389 --> 02:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
question representative Marsh has a
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
Marsh yes thank you Mr chairman and and
 
02:33:58.990 --> 02:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Melissa for taking my question
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
and my question relates to access under
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program um specifically the
 
02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers uh if this
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
bill were to become law uh do you
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
foresee that there would be an access
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
issue for the State Medicaid Program to
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgy centers in the state
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
and would that uh cause a change in the
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
cost and the amount that the state has
 
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
to finance uh in order to fund the State
 
02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:27.469 align:start position:0%
to finance uh in order to fund the State
Medicaid

02:34:27.469 --> 02:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
Program um so I um I'm not uh the
 
02:34:34.389 --> 02:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
foremost expert in our Medicaid Program
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
um Henry Litman is and I can certainly
 
02:34:39.309 --> 02:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
take that question back to him I do uh
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
believe that this you know the the the
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
requirement to have a a policy regarding
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
non you know allowing or caring for all
 
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
individuals regardless of the source of
 
02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
payment um doesn't necessarily just
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
pertain to Medicaid it pertains to all
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
payers and and so um in in having that
 
02:35:02.269 --> 02:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
policy and how they the each facility
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
addresses that policy you know they have
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
different they have different ways to
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
approach um that you know the the
 
02:35:13.150 --> 02:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
creation of that policy and and what we
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
do is we look at the statute to ensure
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
that that the policy just meets the the
 
02:35:19.550 --> 02:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
intent of the statute meets the language
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the statute but how that would
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily impact our Medicaid Program
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can speak
 
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
intelligently to that right now um but I
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
can certainly take that question
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
back uh thank you very much uh Melissa
 
02:35:36.469 --> 02:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
could you also ask Henry to give us some
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
idea of what percentage of the state
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
budget currently is uh the State
 
02:35:42.110 --> 02:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program because I think that
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
may be relevant to this U topic specific
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
to ulatory surgical centers uh just
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in general I believe it's a
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
large percentage of the state budget but
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head what
 
02:35:57.309 --> 02:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
percentage that is
 
02:35:57.319 --> 02:36:00.309 align:start position:0%
percentage that is
okay

02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
call then I end the hearing on House
 
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 290 the committee will take about a
 
02:36:17.269 --> 02:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
four or five minute walking around
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
recess we'll be back at quarter to 12
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
247 it is my intent to go to
 
02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
12:30ish and then break for lunch if
 
02:36:31.389 --> 02:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
we're not done we will have a
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
continuation of 247 so we are adjourned
 
02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
moment

02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
wait sounds like there's a cheaper model
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%

regarding a need for opioid reductions

I've worked closely on a similar bill
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
with three colleagues from the state of
 
02:47:06.870 --> 02:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
West Virginia which is the second worst
 
02:47:08.950 --> 02:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
state in addictions in the United States
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
followed by New Hampshire we were able
 
02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:14.439 align:start position:0%

02:47:18.030 --> 02:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh you US Congress both uh
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
representatives from New Hampshire and

West Virginia and while in Washington we
 
02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
were able to actually meet with the
 
02:47:26.110 --> 02:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Veterans
 
02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
Administration who believed that this
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill would warranted distribution to all
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
the vas in the country as a doctor of
 
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic treating severe patients
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen a drastic reduction in opio
 
02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
use with my VA patients as well as my
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
regular patients and it shows that there
 
02:47:50.269 --> 02:47:50.279 align:start position:0%
is a proven method to Alternative Care
 
02:47:55.309 --> 02:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
statistics shown between 2018 2 2017 and
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
18 is a 70% increase in opioid involved
 
02:48:02.190 --> 02:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
deaths in the United States the CDC has
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
released Grim statistics suggesting that
 
02:48:07.750 --> 02:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
more than 880,000 drug overdoses
 
02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
occurred over the course of a single
 
02:48:12.269 --> 02:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
year ending in March of
 
02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
2020 uh statist statistic also show
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
there has been a more drastic increase
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
in opioid use since the
 
02:48:23.469 --> 02:48:23.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic this bill basically states by
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
first giving the patient the choice to
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
implement Alternative Care before
 
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
prescribing these highly addictive
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
medications we can provide them the
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try one of more proven
 
02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care therapies that I've
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
listed their ability to reduce and
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate pain without potential risk of
 
02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:45.429 align:start position:0%
eliminate pain without potential risk of
addiction

02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
I also want to uh add to that that there
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
are leading medical organizations in the
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
country right now that are recommending
 
02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
and including these Services as a coste
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective means of dealing
 
02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:01.640 align:start position:0%

I know of zero
 
02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
orthopedic medicine precedent where a

law similar to HB
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
247 would determine Medical Treatments
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
and the Order of Medical Treatments or
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislate Orthopedic Medical Treatments
 
02:51:10.190 --> 02:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh in any state that that I know um you
 
02:51:12.229 --> 02:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
know for example it would be nonsensical
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
before you would you legislate before
 
02:51:16.550 --> 02:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
someone received the corona vaccine that
 
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
they would first need Vitamin D or food
 
02:51:22.510 --> 02:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
or water or vitamin C before of course
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
not so the the bill states that before
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
opioids are medically used um let let's
 
02:51:31.070 --> 02:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
say after major heart surgery orthopedic
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
surgery or for a terminal cancer patient
 
02:51:36.229 --> 02:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
in home in hospice that you would
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
somehow legislate that treatments such
 
02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
as acupuncture or Chiropractic
 
02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
treatments would be necessary before
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
opioids are used of course not
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a surgeon and opioids are used for
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
every modern anesthesia for every major
 
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
surgery and they're used temporarily
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
after those major surgeries such as
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
traumas and back surgeries and major
 
02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
surgeries including heart surgeries so
 
02:52:05.229 --> 02:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
am I going to call acupuncturist or
 
02:52:07.229 --> 02:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
chiropractors or a physical therapist
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
into an ER or an O for patients in
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
painful shock that require opioids of
 
02:52:16.349 --> 02:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
course not um in medicine we just take a
 
02:52:16.359 --> 02:52:18.910 align:start position:0%
course not um in medicine we just take a
hypocracy

02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
often prescribe no unnecessary
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
treatments so for 99% of what what I do
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
as a surgeon I prescribe
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter medicines and provide
 
02:52:32.510 --> 02:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
education and guidance and I use a ton
 
02:52:35.790 --> 02:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
of anti-inflammatories Tylenol
 
02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
acupuncture Chiropractic treatments
 
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
physical therapy and sometimes surgery
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
and pretty rarely
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
opioids um but there's no mandates on
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
the order of those in conclusion really
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
Orthopedic muscoskeletal care in any
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
modern state or Society needs to have
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
the treatment dictated by medical and
 
02:52:58.830 --> 02:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
Science rationals and not any
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
nonsensical legal directives on the
 
02:53:06.030 --> 02:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
order of um treatments like in HB 247
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
nonsensical Nikki Kel representa kelse
 
02:53:16.349 --> 02:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
said that her video
 
02:53:19.389 --> 02:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
representative Nikki Kelsey says her
 
02:53:21.750 --> 02:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
video screen is not
 
02:53:26.190 --> 02:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
work it it may sorry chairman it may be
 
02:53:29.309 --> 02:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
a um problem on my end I'm trying to fix
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
it but I just want you guys to know I am
 
02:53:34.429 --> 02:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
here sorry for their
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
Interruption and
 
02:53:36.479 --> 02:53:38.229 align:start position:0%
Interruption and
others

02:53:38.229 --> 02:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:53:38.239 --> 02:53:42.550 align:start position:0%
others
questions

02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
Dr representative has his hand up
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry that was
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
actually a question for the sponsor um
 
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
and I thought maybe we'd be going back
 
02:53:56.830 --> 02:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor but perhaps Dr Milano
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
could answer this because this question
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
because I share something with him is a
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
retired Orthopedic spine surgeon um my
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
concern and I'm wondering if you think
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
the language might be acceptable if we
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
segregated out acute and chronic pain
 
02:54:14.670 --> 02:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
because as the currently it says of the
 
02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
Myriad conditions that cause pain and I
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
agree with you completely that it's
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
illogical to uh use alternative
 
02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
treatments for kidney stones and for hip
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
fractures and so on in chronic pain
 
02:54:29.110 --> 02:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
there may be a role do you think this
 
02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
bill would be acceptable if we said only
 
02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
management I am not a chronic manager of
 
02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
pain and you know it sounds like you you
 
02:54:45.630 --> 02:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
probably weren't either and and I think
 
02:54:49.630 --> 02:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
chronic pain treatment rationals exist
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
and it and it exists to minimize opioid
 
02:54:55.950 --> 02:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
use in principle it's always existed and
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've evolved to minimize opioid use and
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
despite trends that have existed in West
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
Virginia and our state I think a lot of
 
02:55:08.429 --> 02:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
angles on the opioid epidemic have been
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
tackled um but of course for chronic
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
pain there would be a a big difference
 
02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
to state that alternative
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
treatments uh are are critical to use
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
not not even to just legislate they're
 
02:55:25.710 --> 02:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
just critical to use to reduce opioid
 
02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:27.309 align:start position:0%
just critical to use to reduce opioid
dependence

02:55:27.309 --> 02:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
dependence
 
02:55:31.389 --> 02:55:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:31.399 --> 02:55:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
legislate

02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:34.590 align:start position:0%

02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:55:39.070 --> 02:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
question um Mr chair when I have first a
 
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
question of the chair and then a
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
question of Dr
 
02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
Molina is this a second committee Bill
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
and is it going perhaps to Commerce on
 
02:55:51.790 --> 02:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance aspects after here I
 
02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
believe so but I don't know 100% okay
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome um and then my
 
02:56:00.670 --> 02:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
question for Dr Molina is if we
 
02:56:04.349 --> 02:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
separated the bill out a different way
 
02:56:07.710 --> 02:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
and removed the medical mandate but
 
02:56:11.229 --> 02:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
simply allowed the part of the bill to
 
02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
proceed that requires cover for certain
 
02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
nonopioid modalities that are not now
 
02:56:25.950 --> 02:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:29.950 --> 02:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
acceptable is is that question for me I
 
02:56:34.229 --> 02:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.630 --> 02:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
take representative lungren if you want
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
to answer it yeah I'd like I'd like to
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
interject something basically what what
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
the bill should have stated or states is
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
that it requires the physician to have a
 
02:56:50.830 --> 02:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
discussion with the patient as to
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
whether they want to have Alternative
 
02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
Care now everybody seems to be
 
02:57:00.229 --> 02:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
misreading that and
 
02:57:04.110 --> 02:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
um I I think the bill is very sensical
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I I disagree with the doc
 
02:57:10.110 --> 02:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's a basic bill that gives the
 
02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
patient the opportunity
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
simple Yes uh so could you clarify for
 
02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
me then because I'm not sure I'm fully
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
understanding the concept of the
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
directives okay are the nonopioid
 
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
directives something that's coming from
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
the patient like like for example uh
 
02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
Advanced Health Care directives in other
 
02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
fields is that what we're trying to do
 
02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
here and if so in what format do those
 
02:57:50.309 --> 02:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
directives come or is the directive
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
coming from the statute to the doctor
 
02:57:56.190 --> 02:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
direction

02:58:00.349 --> 02:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:03.309 --> 02:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
um I I I wouldn't get I wouldn't go that
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
far my my my intention with this whole
 
02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
bill was is to be able to have a
 
02:58:12.229 --> 02:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
conversation with a patient and allow
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
them to make a choice whether they
 
02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to take the medication or if they
 
02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to proceed with Alternative Care
 
02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
maybe for a two week period Etc this is
 
02:58:26.229 --> 02:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not talking about totally
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
not allowing the physician to Medicaid
 
02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
but at least give the patient the
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
alternative to choose a different method
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the CL may I comment
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
please uh it's Anthony
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
Milano yes Dr go ahead I I I again need
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
to State there there's no precedent for
 
02:58:53.950 --> 02:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
legislating orders of medical treatment
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
such as aspirin use by law before heart
 
02:59:01.389 --> 02:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
surgery or aspirin use before opioids
 
02:59:04.750 --> 02:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
for heart surgery or that there's it's
 
02:59:07.150 --> 02:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat nonsensical it's valid it would
 
02:59:09.630 --> 02:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
have been a wonderful effort 30 years
 
02:59:12.870 --> 02:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
ago before oxyon was created but now
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're in a very much more modern um
 
02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
treatment Paradigm to reduce opioid use
 
02:59:19.309 --> 02:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:59:22.710 --> 02:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
multimodal uh world of of treatments we
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
now have and we all as Physicians have a
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of continued medical
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
education to reduce opioid use and it's
 
02:59:34.349 --> 02:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
the the intent to reduce opioid use is
 
02:59:37.309 --> 02:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
is appreciated but there's no medical
 
02:59:41.229 --> 02:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
rationale on any order of treatments um
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
and to to legislate before opioid use
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
um and and you could legislate that a
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
conversation be had sure if you really
 
02:59:51.630 --> 02:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
want to legislate that you could
 
02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislate that a conversation needs to
 
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
be have but that's that's the directive
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the physician patient relationship um
 
03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
and and that that is between the
 
03:00:04.590 --> 03:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
Physicians treatment providers and
 
03:00:07.389 --> 03:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
patients thank you Dr M Lano I'm told
 
03:00:09.710 --> 03:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
that you have a 12:00 thank you thank
 
03:00:11.790 --> 03:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh for your service and
 
03:00:14.590 --> 03:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
your time thank you and I'll bring back
 
03:00:18.750 --> 03:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
rep uh represent lungren uh that we took
 
03:00:21.550 --> 03:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
a little detour from
 
03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair um I'm having a
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
real hard time with this Zoom thing so
 
03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but um I I just wanted to
 
03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
reiterate that what the bill intends is
 
03:00:37.389 --> 03:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
pain of The Spine and
 
03:00:43.830 --> 03:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
Neck okay he's that Dock's going on on
 
03:00:46.030 --> 03:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
and on about heart conditions and this
 
03:00:47.990 --> 03:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that it's got nothing to do with
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
that now as a practicing chiropractor I
 
03:00:53.469 --> 03:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
can bring up the fact that I've had a
 
03:00:56.150 --> 03:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
patient that fell off a
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
ladder went to the hospital was uh
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosed no broken bone sent home with
 
03:01:07.150 --> 03:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh meds okay after one day of use he he
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
called me he says I'm loopy and I don't
 
03:01:11.550 --> 03:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
know what to do well come on in we'll
 
03:01:14.269 --> 03:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
give it a try well thank God and I mean
 
03:01:16.469 --> 03:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
that thank God 10 days later the the
 
03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
man's pain free but he was he was given
 
03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
92 pills now I keep hearing that it's
 
03:01:25.630 --> 03:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
under it's getting under control this
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is not under control and I think
 
03:01:31.349 --> 03:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
that it it this bill without a doubt
 
03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
gives the patient the right to
 
03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
choose a different care and uh that's
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much what I'm sticking with um
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
and I know that you're uh you know short
 
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
on time and I uh obviously will
 
03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
entertain more questions but uh it it's
 
03:01:53.710 --> 03:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is about having a discussion
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:01:58.030 --> 03:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
patient thank you we're going to take
 
03:02:01.790 --> 03:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
some more questions representative
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
krishman so for
 
03:02:09.070 --> 03:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
clarification um in online one it starts
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
when patient seek treatment for any of
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
the Myriad conditions that cause pain
 
03:02:17.870 --> 03:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
shall refer or prescribe to a patient
 
03:02:19.710 --> 03:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
any of the following treatment
 
03:02:22.910 --> 03:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
Alternatives so there's a shall there so
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:02:27.750 --> 03:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
indicates you know in leg it's
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
must and and then based on the
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
practitioner's clinical judgment that
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
seems to leave room for if they believe
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
that opioids would be the first line
 
03:02:40.349 --> 03:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
treatment in their clinical judgment
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
they they don't have to so the sh is
 
03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:45.550 align:start position:0%
they they don't have to so the sh is
doesn't

03:02:45.550 --> 03:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:02:48.710 --> 03:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
apply and and then availability of
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
treatment um before starting a patient
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
on opid so I think that that's where the
 
03:02:58.910 --> 03:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is um mandating
 
03:03:03.269 --> 03:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
certain medical interventions prior to
 
03:03:09.429 --> 03:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
others um comes from so perhaps some um
 
03:03:12.229 --> 03:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
changing the shell to a
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
May and
 
03:03:18.070 --> 03:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and maybe just clarifying that this
 
03:03:25.070 --> 03:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
is some clarifying language that it is a
 
03:03:27.670 --> 03:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary decision made
 
03:03:31.469 --> 03:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
between the the patient and the
 
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
prescriber okay uh representative lren
 
03:03:36.830 --> 03:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I'll finish your thought here would
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
you be comfortable with that it's got to
 
03:03:39.630 --> 03:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
be a
 
03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:41.550 align:start position:0%
be a
question

03:03:41.550 --> 03:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative gay
 
03:03:50.550 --> 03:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Mr Dr
 
03:03:54.830 --> 03:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
L I definitely think your word your
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
wording needs to be adjusted to meet
 
03:03:59.870 --> 03:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
what you're saying uh a really honorable
 
03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
thing which should keep the shell in
 
03:04:06.190 --> 03:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
choice okay I think your point is
 
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
patients need to know there is an option
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
so right
 
03:04:18.790 --> 03:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
fits but what you shall do do you agree
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
would that satisfy what you're trying to
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
accomplish yes
 
03:04:26.830 --> 03:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative starting with an
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
alternative to opioids because I know my
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
doctor automatically wrote when I had
 
03:04:35.469 --> 03:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
the last time I had surgery
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
automatically wrote me uh an opioid
 
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
prescription only I didn't realize it
 
03:04:43.710 --> 03:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
was until I got it and then I told him I
 
03:04:45.790 --> 03:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
said I don't take that he says I don't
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
either I thought why did you off why
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
didn't you talk to me about this
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.590 --> 03:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Shapiro and
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative kerk have their hands up
 
03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:03.590 align:start position:0%
representative kerk have their hands up
representative

03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman um and
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question or
 
03:05:12.349 --> 03:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
two questions um following up to what
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
other people have alluded to um I think
 
03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
the language doesn't reflect that this
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
is really a question it uses terms like
 
03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:21.710 align:start position:0%
is really a question it uses terms like
a

03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
directive and at the same time it uses a
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
lot of qualifying language like whenever
 
03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.190 align:start position:0%
lot of qualifying language like whenever
possible

03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:05:33.790 --> 03:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
or um practitioners clinical judgment so
 
03:05:36.510 --> 03:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
I would be very happy to do something
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
that mandated that there was a
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
conversation about um various ways of
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
treating pain but I don't think the
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
language really reflects that um my real
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
question um has to do with the part
 
03:05:48.600 --> 03:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
question um has to do with the part
about

03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
coverage and
 
03:05:55.269 --> 03:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
um talking about evidence-based
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
nonopioid treatment for pain including
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
but not limited to it sounds like um
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would create mandatory
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
coverage um for certain treatments um
 
03:06:11.710 --> 03:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
and then leave the opening for insurance
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
companies to um reimburse or not
 
03:06:18.190 --> 03:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
reimburse for many other um treatments
 
03:06:20.710 --> 03:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a real problem I
 
03:06:22.269 --> 03:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
wonder how the problem is going to be
 
03:06:24.550 --> 03:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with that there
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
are basically unlimited kinds of
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
alternative treatments that people use
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
and swear by and
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
um this is my bias but sometimes
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
evidence space is not so um is not
 
03:06:45.550 --> 03:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
clearly defined um so I'm wondering how
 
03:06:45.560 --> 03:06:47.349 align:start position:0%
clearly defined um so I'm wondering how
insurance

03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
companies are really going to deal with
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
what is reimbursed and what is not and
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
if we are picking with this bill if we
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
are kind of picking winners and losers
 
03:07:00.990 --> 03:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
like um yoga therapy yes
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
no I I totally understand what you're
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
saying can you hear me yeah
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes um I realized from uh what I
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
did in West Virginia with gentlemen that
 
03:07:26.269 --> 03:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh there was no increased cost to the
 
03:07:26.279 --> 03:07:28.110 align:start position:0%
uh there was no increased cost to the
patient

03:07:28.110 --> 03:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:07:33.150 --> 03:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I look at it this way is that uh
 
03:07:37.630 --> 03:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
my my medical doctor that I go to if he
 
03:07:40.710 --> 03:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh gave me the opportunity to make a
 
03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
choice and he recommended a essentially
 
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh my going to an
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
osteopath that my my insurance coverage
 
03:07:55.229 --> 03:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
would be applicable um and there would
 
03:08:00.349 --> 03:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:05.070 --> 03:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.429 --> 03:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
help okay I guess I'm you know my
 
03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
question is more addressed towards if
 
03:08:12.309 --> 03:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to mandate coverage of
 
03:08:13.710 --> 03:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
certain altern
 
03:08:13.720 --> 03:08:15.269 align:start position:0%
certain altern
treatments

03:08:15.269 --> 03:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
um how are we going to decide which ones
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
are really effective and um which ones
 
03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
are really effective and um which ones
are

03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
not I I'm sorry I can't answer
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for
 
03:08:32.279 --> 03:08:35.429 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for
representative

03:08:35.429 --> 03:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.190 --> 03:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
lungren representative kerk has his hand
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
up go ahead yes thank you very much um
 
03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you represent lungren I am still
 
03:08:46.110 --> 03:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
very stuck on the language because you
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
made a comment that this bill was for
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
neck and back pain again the area that I
 
03:08:52.710 --> 03:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
worked in but the bill doesn't say that
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
the bill says any of the merried
 
03:08:56.910 --> 03:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
conditions that cause pain which led to
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
Dr melo's testimony of using it with hip
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
fractures kidney stones pancreatitis and
 
03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth we would have to
 
03:09:07.229 --> 03:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
either uh I'm wondering which we'd be
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with sorry question and
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
that is changing it from acute pain to
 
03:09:13.630 --> 03:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
chronic pain which is a an entirely
 
03:09:16.990 --> 03:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
different issue than acute pain or
 
03:09:18.830 --> 03:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
confining it to back and neck but even
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
that has some difficult problems because
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
if you fall out of a tree and have an
 
03:09:23.950 --> 03:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
acute compression fracture that's
 
03:09:26.910 --> 03:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
different than 30 days of back pain so
 
03:09:28.229 --> 03:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
which would you feel more comfortable
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
with moving to if we were going to try
 
03:09:32.309 --> 03:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
to salvage this build to make it
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
workable um I I I think I'd rather see
 
03:09:39.710 --> 03:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
the chronic pain uh
 
03:09:44.110 --> 03:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you did you okay
 
03:09:46.830 --> 03:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
actually can I do a followup followup uh
 
03:09:48.830 --> 03:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative okay my followup actually
 
03:09:50.510 --> 03:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
comes back to what represent Shapiro
 
03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
just finished with and that is I and I
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
think maybe this is what he was driving
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
at we say evidence-based and there's a
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
laundry list and the question is who's
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
evidence right I think that's one of the
 
03:10:01.710 --> 03:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
difficult questions because we know that
 
03:10:03.070 --> 03:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
people can interpret things differently
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
is it going to be a matter of the
 
03:10:08.349 --> 03:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
insurers um doing that because I know
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
that process I've actually participated
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
in helping to develop policies on that
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
based on evidence um that's certainly
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
not an unreasonable option but we have
 
03:10:21.550 --> 03:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
not defined who whose evidence we're
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
using well I I mean let's get back to
 
03:10:31.110 --> 03:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
the um um chronic and acute now I've got
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
evidence based from Dartmouth uh from
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth that uh for acute care that
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
chiropractic has reduced
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
56% yes of the the
 
03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:46.830 align:start position:0%
56% yes of the the
opioids

03:10:46.830 --> 03:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
help may I follow up yeah yes yes I mean
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
I this is my concern about the acute and
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
chronic because I agree with you I would
 
03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
much rather send a patient even though I
 
03:11:04.950 --> 03:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
was a spine surgeon to a chiropractor
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
than to give them an opioid for acute
 
03:11:09.150 --> 03:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
back pain it was far better so the
 
03:11:10.510 --> 03:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's my difficulty with trying to come
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
up with what language you think could
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
work the cute and chronic has some
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
sticky Parts in it as well right I think
 
03:11:20.670 --> 03:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
I think and after looking at all that I
 
03:11:22.510 --> 03:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
I think probably the acute would be the
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry anyone okay I know we're not
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a debate though we'll
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to word this
 
03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
later yeah thank thank you
 
03:11:39.630 --> 03:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative kerk anyone else with a
 
03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
question at this time representative
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
also thank you representative for taking
 
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
my question um I want to commend you for
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
putting in some protection for the
 
03:11:56.190 --> 03:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacist that deals with things on the
 
03:11:58.190 --> 03:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
receiving end however one of the
 
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
questions I have is online 18 on page
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:16.190 align:start position:0%
 
y

03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.550 --> 03:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
what did you say uh line 18 line 18 on
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
page two okay on on line 18 page two it
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
says the pharmacist acting knowingly
 
03:12:28.229 --> 03:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
against the voluntary non Opia directive
 
03:12:31.309 --> 03:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
form um as a pharmacist how would I know
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
I'm acting against it if I don't receive
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
it good
 
03:12:37.319 --> 03:12:41.630 align:start position:0%
it good
question

03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:46.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
I yeah I don't know how to answer that
 
03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:49.910 align:start position:0%
I yeah I don't know how to answer that
I'm

03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:01.550 --> 03:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of there's a lot of uh
 
03:13:03.269 --> 03:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
Corrections that need to be made in this
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I
 
03:13:09.550 --> 03:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
am apologize is that I do not know if
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is what is called an early bill if
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
and I've got several texts out to people
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping they'll tell me really soon
 
03:13:19.150 --> 03:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
if it's an early Bill we got to get it
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
out the door here and just a matter of a
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
few weeks okay not an early bill we can
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
keep it and work on it for a while if
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
there are people from this committee who
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
would like to work with you on that um I
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
think what I'm hearing is many of us see
 
03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
Merit in the bill but problems in the
 
03:13:41.790 --> 03:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
bill so um I'd be willing to do that Mr
 
03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
bill so um I'd be willing to do that Mr
chair

03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
all right and I would be interested in
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
knowing uh if there were people on this
 
03:13:49.750 --> 03:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm I'll round out that
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
group but people on this committee who
 
03:13:54.510 --> 03:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
would be interested working with you is
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
there anyone here okay Mr chairman this
 
03:13:58.950 --> 03:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
is uh representative March and I'd be
 
03:14:02.349 --> 03:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative are there
 
03:14:08.030 --> 03:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
others Mr chairman I would suggest I
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
know it's not time for a motion but this
 
03:14:11.710 --> 03:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
bill would be retained rather than try
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
to work on it at this phase because
 
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are way too many problems in this
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill to be solved uh we do you know we
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
we might tweak some small things but we
 
03:14:21.910 --> 03:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
should not do a complete rebuild of this
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
bill of course which requires would you
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
be interested in
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
helping um perhaps but I would think it
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
should be a retained Bill unless there's
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
something that will allow us to get it
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
done that quickly but we are under the
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
gun with a lot of bills to be done and
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
if Bill isn't really ready for Prime
 
03:14:42.910 --> 03:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
Time retention may be our better option
 
03:14:46.590 --> 03:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's a a good thought
 
03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Weber if you
 
03:14:50.590 --> 03:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
need to balance the numbers I'd be glad
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
to work on this as well but I think that
 
03:14:54.990 --> 03:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
point about the amount of time that it's
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to take under the this is you know
 
03:15:00.110 --> 03:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
we can't just go in the room next door
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
and notice it and have it done it's
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
difficult of course so I will have to
 
03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
determine whether this is a second
 
03:15:08.670 --> 03:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
committee bill which means we've got to
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
do something with it very quickly or if
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is something that we can keep and
 
03:15:16.269 --> 03:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
work on I'll get back to everyone on
 
03:15:18.429 --> 03:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
that but we do have a few other people
 
03:15:20.670 --> 03:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
who signed up to testify and we do have
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:31.790 --> 03:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
Roy uh good afternoon now uh can you
 
03:15:35.469 --> 03:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
hear me yes nice backr excellent thank
 
03:15:38.110 --> 03:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
you um
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
so first of all thank you for taking the
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
time to hear me on this uh bill um a
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
little background on myself in October I
 
03:15:49.229 --> 03:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with something called
 
03:15:49.239 --> 03:15:50.950 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with something called
adhesive

03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
adhesive
 
03:15:53.229 --> 03:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
arachnoiditis um and contrary to what
 
03:15:55.150 --> 03:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
you may think it has nothing to do with
 
03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
spiders um if you look it up it it's a
 
03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
chronic uh uncurable pain condition
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
where the nerves and your lower spine
 
03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
fuse together with scar
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
tissue there is no other treatment for
 
03:16:14.269 --> 03:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
it save pain killers and were it not for
 
03:16:16.469 --> 03:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
um opioid medicines I don't know what
 
03:16:18.910 --> 03:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
level I'd be able to function at
 
03:16:24.710 --> 03:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
today I have encountered um from doctors
 
03:16:27.630 --> 03:16:27.640 align:start position:0%
all the way to pharmacists this stigma
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
against patients who require this
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
medication and I would caution the
 
03:16:34.469 --> 03:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
legislature to stay as far out of the
 
03:16:37.630 --> 03:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship as possible
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
while still being able to um oversee it
 
03:16:45.189 --> 03:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
in in a response responsible manner so I
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
would I would encourage you all to
 
03:16:49.229 --> 03:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
Google what I just said uh adhesive
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
arachnoiditis and understand that there
 
03:16:52.990 --> 03:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
are chronic pain conditions out there
 
03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
that there are no other treatments for
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
um now that's that having been said this
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill looks to me like you've uh you've
 
03:17:02.189 --> 03:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
been handed what what I might call a
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
fixer upper um and I'd be happy to work
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
on it with you to help fix it up because
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
there are some great things in this bill
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh the idea of mandating coverage for
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
Alternative Care such as massage therapy
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care uh acupuncture I think
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea because these things
 
03:17:23.229 --> 03:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
are helpful to a lot of pain patients
 
03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
and they if the insurance doesn't cover
 
03:17:27.389 --> 03:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
it they can't afford it I mean um I go
 
03:17:30.070 --> 03:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
for a Weekly massage myself it doesn't
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily treat the pain but it keeps
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
me mobile it keeps the muscles from All
 
03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
Season up and um you know that's that's
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
over $100 each trip so there's there's
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
some things that this bill could help
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
people who who don't have the money to
 
03:17:45.229 --> 03:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
pay for this Alternative Care but it can
 
03:17:46.950 --> 03:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
lower the amount of opioids they'd have
 
03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
lower the amount of opioids they'd have
to

03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:17:52.389 --> 03:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
take um so I just I I really think that
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's something to be
 
03:17:57.590 --> 03:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
salvaged in this spill I would cut the
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
whole first part out about mandates um
 
03:18:03.229 --> 03:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
just because it it it gets into gets
 
03:18:04.830 --> 03:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
into the weeds of the doctor patient
 
03:18:07.189 --> 03:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
relationship and not there's so many
 
03:18:09.550 --> 03:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
different conditions that the doctors um
 
03:18:11.790 --> 03:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
I mean let's face it they they go to
 
03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
school for so many years and they
 
03:18:15.309 --> 03:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
continue their education throughout
 
03:18:17.630 --> 03:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
their career for us and I know there are
 
03:18:21.070 --> 03:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
some Physicians here among you um and
 
03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
for us non-physicians or non-experienced
 
03:18:25.309 --> 03:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
people to come in and say well you know
 
03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
this is how you have to deal with this
 
03:18:31.349 --> 03:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
is is is just um it's not a good idea
 
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I I believe in legislative
 
03:18:35.469 --> 03:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
oversight but not legislative
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
interference and I think that there's um
 
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
a lot to be saved and salvaged in this
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill and if it is a second commit bill I
 
03:18:46.349 --> 03:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
would be happy to lend my um my
 
03:18:48.990 --> 03:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
experience um not necessarily in in
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
medicine but as a patient committee to
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
that uh work group thank I didn't hear
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry you've just been appointed
 
03:18:58.830 --> 03:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
to the work
 
03:19:00.910 --> 03:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
group I don't I don't recall
 
03:19:03.309 --> 03:19:03.319 align:start position:0%

03:19:07.150 --> 03:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'd be happy to and I'd be happy to
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%

volunteered
 
03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:18.030 align:start position:0%
volunteered
twice

03:19:18.030 --> 03:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
twice
 
03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
Zoom I just uh got the official word
 
03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:29.640 align:start position:0%

together a work group if this is not an
 
03:19:43.189 --> 03:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
early bill
 
03:19:46.469 --> 03:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
might you consider asking chairman if he
 
03:19:48.790 --> 03:19:48.800 align:start position:0%

03:23:39.070 --> 03:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
um basically uh Dr Kirk and Dr Milano
 
03:23:40.469 --> 03:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
covered pretty much everything I was
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to say I'll be very brief um
 
03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:46.590 align:start position:0%
going to say I'll be very brief um
basically

03:23:46.590 --> 03:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:23:49.150 --> 03:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
um and I was very glad to hear the
 
03:23:51.670 --> 03:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill Dr lram talk about
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
converting this to spine and back
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
because as a general surgeon I'll give
 
03:23:57.389 --> 03:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
you a little background I I practiced
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
general surgery and conquered for over
 
03:24:01.710 --> 03:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
30 years and I retired from clinical
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
practice about six years ago but I still
 
03:24:05.189 --> 03:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
teach Dartmouth medical students three
 
03:24:08.590 --> 03:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
times a week and I also teach about 15
 
03:24:12.070 --> 03:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
times uh a year in the gross anatomy lab
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth and um the pain that we're
 
03:24:17.229 --> 03:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
all talking about here is was called
 
03:24:19.189 --> 03:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
sematic pain and from teaching anatomy
 
03:24:21.309 --> 03:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
and physiology there's a type of pain
 
03:24:23.950 --> 03:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
called visceral pain also uh somebody
 
03:24:25.910 --> 03:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
alluded to pancreatic disease that's
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
visceral your GI track your gallbladder
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
all those things are visceral these
 
03:24:32.429 --> 03:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
alternative treatments I don't think
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
have any evidence-based
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
information based on visceral pain when
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
you're laying on hands which all these
 
03:24:42.590 --> 03:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
conditions are talk about here all these
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
Alternatives including naturopathic
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
medicine uh you can see where that may
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
have some basis on sematic medicine
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
which is or somatic pain which is bones
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
joints and so forth but there's a whole
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
field of pain out there that we're not
 
03:24:57.150 --> 03:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
even getting near and the fact that the
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors willing to Define that is
 
03:25:00.750 --> 03:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
probably the most important thing if
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to continue to work on this
 
03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
bill um there are other comments talked
 
03:25:07.790 --> 03:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
about basic and I I want to be brief it
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
said shall prescribe based on Judgment
 
03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
of the pH of the provider and uh whether
 
03:25:16.229 --> 03:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
these alternatives are readily available
 
03:25:18.189 --> 03:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh Judgment of the provider is something
 
03:25:19.950 --> 03:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
that the Board of Medicine deals with
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
about 500 times a year U that's the
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
number of complaints and lawsuits and so
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
forth that we have to deal with I spent
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
17 years On The Board of Medicine until
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
last year um so when it comes down to
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
judgment if there's concerns about that
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh and sometimes the judgment to use
 
03:25:40.229 --> 03:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
something is not correct that's where
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine is forward for um
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be a good idea uh
 
03:25:48.030 --> 03:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing about alternative these
 
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
alternative medic these alternative
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
ideas are growing Beyond a doubt for a
 
03:25:54.349 --> 03:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
good thing but they're not usually
 
03:25:57.469 --> 03:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
available 247 even an urgent care center
 
03:25:59.950 --> 03:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
is not open at night so one of the
 
03:26:01.950 --> 03:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
biggest volumes of work in an emergency
 
03:26:03.710 --> 03:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
room at night is patients that come in
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
with pain and all these alternatives are
 
03:26:07.710 --> 03:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
really not available right there and
 
03:26:10.590 --> 03:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
then and those folks often get opioids
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
and that's hard fix unless all these
 
03:26:14.349 --> 03:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
alternative folks are willing to be
 
03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
there all the time uh my last comment is
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh to uh representative
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
lram that horrible story told about
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
somebody being discharged with 92 pills
 
03:26:28.389 --> 03:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's an exact example of where that
 
03:26:30.070 --> 03:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
complaint in my mind should go to the
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine not not be not with
 
03:26:35.070 --> 03:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
legislation created simply because of
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
that if that's the motivation so those
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
are my comments but basically uh Jerry
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
Kirk and and Anthony Milano covered my
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
points that are in my written
 
03:26:45.790 --> 03:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
testimony Dr
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%

03:28:17.070 --> 03:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
personal history on back in 1972 And I I
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
had extensive knee surgery after a
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
motorcycle accident and being young and
 
03:28:23.670 --> 03:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
stupid I became addicted to opioid pain
 
03:28:26.670 --> 03:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
pain meds I know the pain of addiction I
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
know the pain in my mother's eyes in an
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
in inner voice when she said I hope your
 
03:28:32.189 --> 03:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
grandmother never finds out it'll it
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
would kill her and not being able to do
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
anything about it it was a living
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
03:28:40.110 --> 03:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
powerlessness now fast forward uh seven
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I broke my back back after
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
falling 15 ft while climbing into a tree
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
stand while hunting I was prescribed
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
perco set 5 migs at first at the
 
03:28:50.990 --> 03:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
hospital then I called my primary care
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
and uh they uh they gave me 40 40 perco
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
set of 10 milligrams to be taken one
 
03:28:58.750 --> 03:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
every four hours for pain the pain was
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
excruciating for the first two or three
 
03:29:02.469 --> 03:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
days and when the pain subsided I was
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
able to back off off back I start
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
started backing off the Percocet dosage
 
03:29:09.790 --> 03:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
using a t unit a mile form of electric
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
muscle stimulation provided by my
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
chiropractor which helped immensely with
 
03:29:13.520 --> 03:29:14.229 align:start position:0%
chiropractor which helped immensely with
my

03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:29:17.070 --> 03:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
pain I started going to the chiropractor
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
chiropractor approximately one week
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
after the after the injury and use a
 
03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
stronger electric muscle stimulation and
 
03:29:25.790 --> 03:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
laser therapy on my back because of the
 
03:29:28.269 --> 03:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
these alternative therapies therapies I
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
was be I was able to be pain medication
 
03:29:32.990 --> 03:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
free at around three weeks post
 
03:29:36.189 --> 03:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
injury as legislators I feel we have no
 
03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
we we should leave no stone unturned in
 
03:29:40.349 --> 03:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
the battle against opioid addiction some
 
03:29:42.150 --> 03:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
argue that if we passed this bill as
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
written required requiring health
 
03:29:45.990 --> 03:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to pay for the for
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
some alternative therapy treatments that
 
03:29:50.670 --> 03:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance rates would rise but I
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
would argue that those costs would be
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
offset by insurance companies not having
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
to pay for the for the usually multiple
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation hospital stays or the uh
 
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the the the therapies that have come
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
out in the last few years such as
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
suboxin which is is the costs are pretty
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
prohibitive uh taxpayers wouldn't have
 
03:30:09.269 --> 03:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
to pay for the unfortunate
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
incarcerations and broken families of
 
03:30:12.510 --> 03:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
and result from
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
addiction I'm grateful to say because of
 
03:30:17.110 --> 03:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
Al of the alternative therapies which
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't covered by the insur by insurance
 
03:30:21.910 --> 03:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
companies provided by my chiropractor I
 
03:30:23.830 --> 03:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
used only the first 10 5 milligram
 
03:30:26.550 --> 03:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
perette and 22 of the 10 milligrams and
 
03:30:28.229 --> 03:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
have 18 left over which will be turned
 
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
over to the dairy Police Department soon
 
03:30:32.349 --> 03:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
most importantly my family doesn't have
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
to go through the agony of having an op
 
03:30:37.510 --> 03:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
op opioid addicted loved one once again
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
members for taking my testimony and I'll
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
take any
 
03:30:44.950 --> 03:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
 
03:30:44.960 --> 03:30:48.630 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
representative

03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.110 --> 03:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
love seeing none the chair recognizes
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
department hi Tyler Brandon from the New
 
03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department um I am
 
03:31:17.229 --> 03:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
the director of health health economics
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
with the department and I'm going to
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
focus just on the insurance provisions
 
03:31:23.910 --> 03:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill as um probably most of you
 
03:31:26.030 --> 03:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
know when the department testifies we
 
03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't normally have a position on a bill
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that's the case today um that
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
being said I'm going to address a couple
 
03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
of concerns um the bill would be a
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
significant policy development and
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's a a legislative decision but it
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
does create some new insurance mandates
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and when I say mandates I'm talking
 
03:31:46.229 --> 03:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
about sort of traditional Insurance
 
03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
mandates that change the scope of
 
03:31:50.910 --> 03:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
services that are covered it also
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
impacts both the group and the
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
individual markets and that's important
 
03:31:57.790 --> 03:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
in general insurance mandates do put
 
03:31:59.710 --> 03:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on health insurance
 
03:32:01.630 --> 03:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
premiums there is sometimes the
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
assumption that if you get better access
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
to certain types of services cost
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
overall will be lower um because people
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
who might not otherwise use the services
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
now use them when you look at costs at a
 
03:32:15.070 --> 03:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
population level they often go up even
 
03:32:17.070 --> 03:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
when you might think otherwise for
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
particular patients because it impacts
 
03:32:22.110 --> 03:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
the individual Market uh the federal
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
government has said that when a state
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
passes a mandate the additional costs of
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
those mandates because the federal
 
03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
government pays premium subsidies in the
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
individual Market those additional costs
 
03:32:37.150 --> 03:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
need to be made up for by the state so
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
it could incur a liability for the state
 
03:32:41.469 --> 03:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
it's one of the big things that we have
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with with mandates these days
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
and often legislation is modified so
 
03:32:48.189 --> 03:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't impact that particular
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
market and create the state
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
liability some of the services listed
 
03:32:54.630 --> 03:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
are a little unclear because they're not
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
traditional medical services that
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
insurers get built for that creates a a
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
dynamic in terms of how you track those
 
03:33:05.469 --> 03:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
claims how the claims get submitted to a
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh ensure and even how the services are
 
03:33:09.670 --> 03:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
described in yoga therapy and
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
acupuncture probably good examples of
 
03:33:13.469 --> 03:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
that but because the legislation's
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
pretty open-ended um there could be a
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
number of other services that that would
 
03:33:19.950 --> 03:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
be of concern the good news is New
 
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually has a process for
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
reviewing mandates and um the chair of a
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee can request that of the
 
03:33:28.150 --> 03:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
department we have an Actuarial firm
 
03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's on staff they can do a mandate
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
review tell you more about the costs and
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's a specific process for doing
 
03:33:36.269 --> 03:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
mandate review that includes looking at
 
03:33:37.710 --> 03:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
the social
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
benefit there's also the issue with uh
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
creating sort of a payment parody with
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
visits to a primary care provider so
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
because there are screening services
 
03:33:50.510 --> 03:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
that are not subject to cost sharing
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
deductibles if you create this type of
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
parody you're going to run into problems
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
with the high deductible Health Plan HSA
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
type Arrangements these are tax favored
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
accounts but they have to have cost
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
sharing deductibles apply to any service
 
03:34:06.510 --> 03:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
that is not considered screening or
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
preventive that's by the federal
 
03:34:11.070 --> 03:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
government so you'd have to include
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
those types of products which again is
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
not unprecedented but um it is something
 
03:34:17.870 --> 03:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
a dynamic that would need to be
 
03:34:20.189 --> 03:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
considered the same issue exists for
 
03:34:22.189 --> 03:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
catastrophic health insurance products
 
03:34:24.670 --> 03:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
that also require cost sharing uh full
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
cost sharing for for most
 
03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
Services um so as I mentioned we don't
 
03:34:31.309 --> 03:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
have a position hady to take any
 
03:34:33.189 --> 03:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
questions but I want to address just the
 
03:34:37.189 --> 03:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill questions for Tyler Brennan uh
 
03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Brennan um I was
 
03:34:50.830 --> 03:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
wondering short of um requesting that
 
03:34:52.429 --> 03:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
kind of intense
 
03:34:56.269 --> 03:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation is is was there supposed to
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal note on this and maybe
 
03:35:01.309 --> 03:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's a question for the chair rather
 
03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
than for Mr Brennan but I'm just
 
03:35:06.670 --> 03:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
wondering I don't see a FAL note
 
03:35:10.189 --> 03:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah we we do get and I can answer in
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
terms of fiscal notes in general we get
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
requests for fiscal notes the the life
 
03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
and health actual reviews them I take a
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
look at them just to to make sure that
 
03:35:20.349 --> 03:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's um appropriate for for the
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
audience of the legislature but the the
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes typically say it may have
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
an upward pressure on claims it's
 
03:35:29.309 --> 03:35:29.319 align:start position:0%
indeterminable about how much and we're
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
only looking at this from a premium tax
 
03:35:33.189 --> 03:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
point of view so in general they don't
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
go into a lot of depth there's not the
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
kind of deep analysis that would be a
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
part of a mandate review um as a part of
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note process
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Shapiro has his
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
hand up representative Shapiro thank you
 
03:35:55.469 --> 03:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr Brennan for
 
03:35:58.510 --> 03:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in regards to the
 
03:36:01.189 --> 03:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
Mandate review is that a state part of a
 
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
state agency that does that or is that
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
an independent contract and second part
 
03:36:10.189 --> 03:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the question is you said that part of
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
that review is looking at Value and cost
 
03:36:18.189 --> 03:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
does it would it also um evaluate the
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the mandates that we're
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually talking
 
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
about so the request would come to the
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department the insurance
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
department has a contract with a a
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
private company um they have analysts
 
03:36:33.550 --> 03:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
and an act on staff they would produce
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
their own report um so in a sense it's
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
it's done by a third party but it would
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
be done through the insurance department
 
03:36:43.030 --> 03:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the opinions would be theirs the
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
specific part of the statute which is
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 400 a39 b uh it does include a
 
03:36:51.389 --> 03:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
number of things and it spells out
 
03:36:53.349 --> 03:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
saying the report shall include at a
 
03:36:54.990 --> 03:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
minimum and to the extent that
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
information is available the social
 
03:36:59.670 --> 03:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
impact of mandating the benefit the
 
03:37:01.389 --> 03:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
financial impact of mandating the
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
benefit the medical efficacy of
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
mandating the benefit the effects of
 
03:37:07.710 --> 03:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
balancing the social economic and
 
03:37:12.030 --> 03:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
medical effect efficacy considerations
 
03:37:13.469 --> 03:37:13.479 align:start position:0%
and for the purpose of this section a
 
03:37:15.269 --> 03:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
mandated benefit proposals one that
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%

submit what he said and writing if he
 
03:37:51.150 --> 03:37:51.160 align:start position:0%

uh my name is Adam larner I am the
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
President of the New Hampshire
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and Asian medicine
 
03:38:27.790 --> 03:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
Association we are the the association
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
of acupuncturist all throughout the
 
03:38:31.469 --> 03:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh additionally
 
03:38:34.110 --> 03:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
I've been in practice since 2005 and I
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
just want to speak briefly to to uh lend
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
our association support for the bill as
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
well as with a clarifying amendment that
 
03:38:43.870 --> 03:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
we offered in our written testimony that
 
03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
was sent yesterday uh and that that
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying Amendment just goes to um in
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill when they're
 
03:38:54.630 --> 03:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
talking about insurance coverage uh
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture has listed multiple times as
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
a covered service but in the exact line
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
when they're talking about uh 20 visits
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh 20 visits uh being approved that
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
acupuncture has left off that list and
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
it seems that given it's it's mentioned
 
03:39:14.670 --> 03:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
in multiple other places it seems like
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
it was probably uh an afterthought so in
 
03:39:19.269 --> 03:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
in our written testimony we propose a
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
clarifying amendment to that but you
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
know so many people in our state have
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
been touched by this opioid crisis I I I
 
03:39:28.110 --> 03:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
know there's so many stories but but as
 
03:39:29.950 --> 03:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
a practitioner I would be remiss if I
 
03:39:31.469 --> 03:39:31.479 align:start position:0%
didn't take this quick opportunity to
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
tell you Michael's story you know
 
03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
Michael is a patient in a mine and when
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
I met him he was in his late 40s he was
 
03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
a a very successful profession in the
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast Area New Hampshire he had uh
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know beautiful family with two
 
03:39:47.309 --> 03:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
daughters and and he had a knee injury
 
03:39:49.150 --> 03:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
and he was prescribed opioids for his
 
03:39:51.630 --> 03:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
knee injury and he took his prescription
 
03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
as prescribed and then a couple of
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
months later he found himself horribly
 
03:39:57.870 --> 03:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
addicted to the point where he was
 
03:39:59.710 --> 03:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
trying to score pills at
 
03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
parties and his addiction I mean it
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
destroyed his life and I'll never I'll
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
never forget the day where he was in my
 
03:40:10.990 --> 03:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
office with tears in his eyes
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
and now years after the addiction and
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this for years when he
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
saw how well acupuncture worked to
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
manage his pain you know he just he said
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
I just wish I knew that this was an this
 
03:40:28.510 --> 03:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
was an option I I I wish I wish I wish
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
this was something that was available to
 
03:40:32.670 --> 03:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
me and and knowing and I can tell you
 
03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
that I have a bunch of these types of
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
stories and and and and I can guarantee
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
you that virtually every practitioner in
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
the state has stories just like this you
 
03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
know and several of the other folks who
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
have spoken already have have said that
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
there have been changes and I think
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
there probably have been changes in how
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
these medications have been prescribed
 
03:40:55.630 --> 03:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
but the the bottom line is the CDC said
 
03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
that in the year that ended in the
 
03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
middle of 2020 it was the there were the
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
most overdoses so the situation really
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
isn't getting better yet you know so
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
more changes are necessary and knowing
 
03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
what we know now I think it's hard to
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
make any kind of reasonable argument
 
03:41:15.150 --> 03:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be using every tool
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
that works to help prevent addiction
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
whenever possible and acupuncture works
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know we we we have lots of evidence
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
of this now in the written testimony I
 
03:41:27.149 --> 03:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
sent we sent some really some really
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
strong references to to studies that
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
have been done maybe the most compelling
 
03:41:33.790 --> 03:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know statement of this though is
 
03:41:37.710 --> 03:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
that in 2020 after really exhaustive
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
research in both efficacy and and cost
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness Medicare decided to cover
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
acupuncture for 20 visits for low back
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
pain okay so uh you know
 
03:41:53.429 --> 03:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
um I I think that I think that's really
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
really powerful um so thank you so much
 
03:41:58.670 --> 03:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
for listening you know I'd be glad at at
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
some later point when when the time is
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to talk more about
 
03:42:04.750 --> 03:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture with people as as as a
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
therapy you know it's very old but I
 
03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
know it's new to a lot of folks as well
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
um you know a as a therapy it's non
 
03:42:14.149 --> 03:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
addictive It's very effective and it
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
would really be my privilege to to to
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
talk to people about it and show you
 
03:42:19.469 --> 03:42:19.479 align:start position:0%

03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
figure it out all right 1:00 all right I
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.880 --> 03:44:25.429 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:40.990 align:start position:0%
 
Lucy

03:44:40.990 --> 03:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
Lucy
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
Lu

03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.680 --> 03:55:42.890 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:55:42.890 --> 03:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:42.900 --> 03:57:12.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:57:12.149 --> 03:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:12.159 --> 03:57:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:37.600 --> 03:59:04.590 align:start position:0%
 
weird

03:59:04.590 --> 03:59:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:06.990 --> 03:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
I just I did it on
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
theen yes
 
03:59:11.450 --> 03:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
I I believe we are
 
03:59:11.460 --> 03:59:13.469 align:start position:0%
I I believe we are
[Music]

03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
uned that's really hard for me doing
 
03:59:19.670 --> 03:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is the sound some
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
people's microphones are so bad I'm just
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
straining to
 
03:59:29.550 --> 03:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
understand it's it's when when you're on
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
a call from home it's better generally
 
03:59:34.750 --> 03:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
speaking rather than in
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
this because I haven't had any problems
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
before today
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
understanding anybody today has
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.429 --> 03:59:48.439 align:start position:0%
myar Mr
 
03:59:52.349 --> 03:59:52.359 align:start position:0%

if you willing to reopen that for a very
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
short time he has a short
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%

glitches as we spoke about two days
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
ago okay and apparently I skipped
 
04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
somebody else to to all right so we are
 
04:00:43.950 --> 04:00:43.960 align:start position:0%

and members of the Health and Human
 
04:01:13.870 --> 04:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
Services uh committee it's nice to be
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
back in front of you and working with
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
you my name is Andrew Hosmer and I'm
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
representing Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire's largest not
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
for-profit Health insurer and serving
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
over two million customers throughout
 
04:01:28.510 --> 04:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
New England uh HP um Harvard Pilgrim is
 
04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
focused on the health and well-being of
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
our members and always open to
 
04:01:34.110 --> 04:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
innovative ideas that allow us to better
 
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
serve those that we cover um Harvard
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim currently supports supports the
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
idea of finding alternatives to the use
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
of opioids but as written we oppose HB
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
247 we'll draw your attention to
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
specifically sections two to five uh we
 
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
find that the coverage mandate there is
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
problematic um just to to be clear we
 
04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
currently offer plans that cover
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care osteopathic
 
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
manipulative treatment and acupuncture
 
04:02:03.550 --> 04:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
treatment so mandating this type of
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
coverage seems unnecessary Harvard
 
04:02:08.189 --> 04:02:08.199 align:start position:0%
program also covers physical therapy and
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy on all of its plans
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
Harvard pilgram also covers a range of
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
safe nonopioid uh medication options and
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
has been supportive of that for quite
 
04:02:21.550 --> 04:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
some time uh specifically to the yoga
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
coverage it reminds us of the bill that
 
04:02:26.149 --> 04:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
that was filed last year we do not cover
 
04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
yoga because there is no licensing or
 
04:02:31.149 --> 04:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
credentialing of yoga instructors unlike
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
the other services mentioned in the bill
 
04:02:34.990 --> 04:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
which makes it impossible for us to
 
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
determine if an instructor is qualified
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
Andor effective
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh this also creates concerns about how
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
um efficacy is determined and I think it
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
was mentioned by I believe
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative kerk
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
earlier uh reflecting back on uh the
 
04:02:54.309 --> 04:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
yoga mandate bill from last session um
 
04:02:56.149 --> 04:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
these were also the concerns we had last
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
year and that's why it was recommended
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
for no further legislation on a 14 to1
 
04:03:03.070 --> 04:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
vote by the Commerce Committee so uh we
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
also would agree with um Tyler Brennan's
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
assessment that this new insurance
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
mandate create a cost for the state as
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires any new insurance
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
mandate passed by the state to be
 
04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
covered by the state for any individuals
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
purchasing insurance on the exchange uh
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
again though we support innovative ideas
 
04:03:23.830 --> 04:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
and discussing alternatives to opioids
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
we oppose HB 247 as written and ask that
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill either be Rewritten
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
retained or and preferably um it by the
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much and I
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate your the opportunity to speak
 
04:03:42.429 --> 04:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
would you take a question uh I'll do my
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes seeing no questions thank you for
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Jennifer o
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
Higgins who got left off the list before
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
we broke for lunch so with apologies
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
Jennifer o Higgins from
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS and her position is neutral on the
 
04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill are you with us still yes good
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and apologies that's
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay so hello I'm Jenny O Higgins I'm
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative liaison and Senior
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
policy analyst for the division of
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health within DHHS thank you
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
for your time today I'm here just to
 
04:04:30.389 --> 04:04:30.399 align:start position:0%
provide information on behalf of DHHS
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna jump in you got to go
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
slower because it's distorting the
 
04:04:36.910 --> 04:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
equipment doing something so a little
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
slower please I apologize thank
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
you so HB 247 is very similar to HB 708
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
from last session and the department was
 
04:04:49.469 --> 04:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
asked to complete a fiscal note
 
04:04:51.630 --> 04:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
worksheet on that bill last session but
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
were not asked for fiscal impact on HB
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
247 so for this reason we wanted to just
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
bring to the attention of the committee
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill requires DHHS to develop a
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary non-opioid directive form and
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
to create rules around such a form the
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
bill also amends the provisions in the
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
insurance statute to require that
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
insurance provide coverage for these not
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
these evidence-based not opioid
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
treatment um the department assumes this
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
applies to Commercial insur Insurance
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
and not the department but if it applies
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid dhjs would need to develop
 
04:05:27.950 --> 04:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
and Implement a new Medicaid service to
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
comply with this requirement as the
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
state's Medicaid Program does not
 
04:05:33.790 --> 04:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
currently cover Chiropractic yoga
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
acupuncture treatment so the department
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
is unable to estimate the cost of a
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
establishing such a benefit or the
 
04:05:40.990 --> 04:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources necessary to
 
04:05:41.000 --> 04:05:44.110 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources necessary to
implement

04:05:44.110 --> 04:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
04:05:52.030 --> 04:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
all and now I realize there are some
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to um indicate
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
they would like to testify but um they
 
04:06:03.550 --> 04:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
didn't get under the wire so I am
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
closing the hearing on that bill and we
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
will now open the hearing on
 
04:06:12.990 --> 04:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
157 repealing the State Health
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
assessment and State Health Improvement
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
plan Council and the chair recognizes
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards all right I think I'm unmuted
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah all right uh I don't think you're
 
04:06:40.590 --> 04:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
able to see me though which is a shame
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
because I got dressed up at least from
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
the waist up for this August group so um
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh I have dogs in the house they'll make
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit of noise I'm uh I'm
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards um I uh four
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
years ago I was sitting where you all
 
04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
are not in your houses but there in the
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
L and uh I don't really know much more
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
than I did then but but uh but I have
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
been around a while this is my third
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
term I'm on finance division 3 where the
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
the division that finances appropriates
 
04:07:20.429 --> 04:07:20.439 align:start position:0%
money for DHHS and the veterans home I'm
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
also on uh the HHS oversight committee
 
04:07:27.389 --> 04:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
um and before I really get going do do
 
04:07:30.389 --> 04:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
members have uh the email attachment I
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
sent prior to the meeting it was just
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
this morning but it was a few hours
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
ago I think most of living in a meeting
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
and didn't have access to a
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
printer okay um I have been polishing
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
this thing uh so I'll I'll be sending a
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
an updated version anyways but um so
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
what uh House Bill 157 does is it
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
repeals the the the
 
04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
current um
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
legislative requirements and
 
04:08:06.429 --> 04:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
specifications for a state health
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
assessment that's uh that's in our in
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
our rsas and it also repeals a brand new
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement uh plan Council
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
my reasons for this if you were to
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
summarize it it would be uh
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
redundancy and making sure that the
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
lines of communication and
 
04:08:31.389 --> 04:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
accountability are clear uh this is a
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that uh got I think
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
caught up in the covid
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
craziness um and uh the Senate heard it
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
put it into a large Omnibus Bill uh and
 
04:08:50.109 --> 04:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
it never came back to the house
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
apparently for the house to look
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
specifically at the establishment of
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
this State Health Improvement Council I
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
think if you if you had had hearings on
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
it you you would you would have found
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we shouldn't have done
 
04:09:08.349 --> 04:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
this uh it's it's redundant in the sense
 
04:09:11.149 --> 04:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
that the current IRS
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
code um requires that uh Community
 
04:09:20.229 --> 04:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
Hospitals perform ongoing uh assessments
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
within every three years to go out and
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
get their Community input to address the
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
the community uh Public Health needs and
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
other needs uh of that Community they
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
put that into a report they provide a
 
04:09:39.389 --> 04:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
copy of that to uh to
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
DHHS um and and so uh DHHS all already
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
has sort of this boots on the ground
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
Bottoms Up driven set of reports on the
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
the health assessment of each
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
community so we created a new new
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy last summer that's
 
04:10:00.640 --> 04:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy last summer that's
absolutely

04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
enormous how big is enormous it's so big
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
that it has to have 17 people just to
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
quorum now U management study suggest if
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
you really want an effective committee
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh you try to keep it between five and
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
seven so 17 as a quorum number is just
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh unwieldy in in my view so we we've
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
got a pretty large uh uh Council that's
 
04:10:35.149 --> 04:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
been set up now and and it isn't just
 
04:10:37.229 --> 04:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's set up so big it's
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
that that it uh
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
supplements and stands as a a a side by
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
side separate organizational structure
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to do these State Health
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
assessments and develop the State Health
 
04:10:53.000 --> 04:10:54.550 align:start position:0%
assessments and develop the State Health
assessment

04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
plans um and so um the
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh has this Bolton
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy that uh needs to be
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
contended with that is sort of in
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
between him or her and the public health
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
employees that the state employs to do
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing um and so what I'm
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
going to use a military term but it's
 
04:11:23.790 --> 04:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
the same whether you go study business
 
04:11:27.870 --> 04:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh organizational uh design and behavior
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
um the whole concept of unity of command
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
gets thrown off because you don't have a
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
clear line of sight from the
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner to his Public Health uh um
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
employees and and and therefore you're
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
also breaking the expectation of the
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
governor to be able to reach out and do
 
04:11:50.030 --> 04:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
a One-Stop shop with uh with his or her
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner to find out where things
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
go interestingly if you go read the
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
specifics around the
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
plan the this Council actually has more
 
04:12:06.990 --> 04:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
Authority than the commissioner does
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to creating this plan
 
04:12:12.309 --> 04:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
because of the use of the word
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
sh in the law it says the State Health
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan shall guide the
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
department in assessing planning
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
implementing and monitoring Improvement
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the health and well-being of New
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population well that shall
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
means the commissioner shall take the
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
plan and implement it and and he or
 
04:12:39.109 --> 04:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
he I I I'm I'm sorry I keep screwing up
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
on the gender I I'm from the Midwest
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're all you guys so so the guy is uh
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
is confused about whether or not um he
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
or she is in charge of this plan or not
 
04:12:56.429 --> 04:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
but when the plan is done by the council
 
04:13:00.109 --> 04:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
the law says it shall be complied with
 
04:13:05.309 --> 04:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
so um I would say um for those reasons
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's just bad organizational Des design
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
now if you actually get to the plan
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
itself um it it it hardcodes to use a
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
software term it hardcodes things that
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh the plan should cover and strategy
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
imperatives of the plan it it it it
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
effectively takes the legislative
 
04:13:31.950 --> 04:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
priorities of 2020 in the midst of a
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic and puts them into the law and
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
so therefore if we were to come back and
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
2030 or
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
2040 uh it's likely that this plan will
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
have been become kind of stale in the
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
sense that it's no longer responsive to
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
the needs of society in the moment
 
04:13:54.790 --> 04:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
because the the boundary conditions are
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
very well defined in the law and I think
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
too well defined I'd say that strategic
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
planning is a is a key part of why we
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
hire Commissioners like for example our
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of DOI t uh he does glay
 
04:14:14.790 --> 04:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner glay he does a strategic
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
Information Technology plan he's not
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
required to do that by law and and and
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
and they update and maintain that plan
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
so that there's an ongoing road map so
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they know what systems they're
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
going to be replacing what new
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
functionality they need what sort of
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
interoperability is
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
desired but in the next year the next
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
iteration of the plan if the priority
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
shift they can do that um so I would say
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
that uh defining as specifically as has
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
been done in the law exactly what the
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
plan should cover is a mistake it
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't age well and and and I think
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we hire Commissioners to to
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide that level of
 
04:14:59.239 --> 04:15:00.429 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide that level of
strategic

04:15:00.429 --> 04:15:00.439 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
04:15:05.070 --> 04:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
management if you um are curious about
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
my claim that
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
this the health assessment plan is
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
redundant at the bottom of what I've
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
provided you I've just copied and pasted
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
the relevant portion of the IRS code and
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that commun Community
 
04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
Hospitals have to do this kind of work
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
anyways they provide a copy to uh the
 
04:15:33.229 --> 04:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner and his or her staff and
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
and so we have the material that we need
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
now I have heard some people argue that
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
well the commissioner just hasn't been
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
doing it or it's not been a priority to
 
04:15:48.269 --> 04:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner well okay so if you
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
have poor leadership I can tell you you
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's better to go get better leadership
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
than it is to add a huge organizational
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
structure of another 30 35 people to to
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
to hey hey my dogs are going nut sorry
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're happy though um
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
so uh you just get better leaders you
 
04:16:13.950 --> 04:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
get better employees you don't you don't
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
come up with a redundant parallel
 
04:16:18.990 --> 04:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
universe to overcome their weaknesses
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and as a member of the I'm almost
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
done I I know I'm running long I'm so
 
04:16:27.149 --> 04:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
sorry the the other part of this is uh I
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
as a member of HHS oversight if there's
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
a failure of leadership to do this job
 
04:16:34.590 --> 04:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
well I would hope that the oversight
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
committee would would be on it and and I
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
and you and you know that I I suspect as
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
HHS members that your chairman also
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
chairs the HHS oversight committee so I
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm proposing to you that there are
 
04:16:51.990 --> 04:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
remedies uh if there's been a problem in
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
the past to to not have it live into the
 
04:16:57.550 --> 04:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
future and with that I'm done I'll take
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative representative McKay have
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair is that you as
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I'm sorry sir I can't hear
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
you are you co-sponsor of this leg yes
 
04:17:14.429 --> 04:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
does that have any effect on
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
your I'm not saying a word about it
 
04:17:24.830 --> 04:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
usually P practice the chair steps
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
down yes okay I unless I'm really told
 
04:17:31.790 --> 04:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise would like to continue but not
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
speak yeah I just wanted to know what I
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
were going to be doing this I appreciate
 
04:17:36.479 --> 04:17:37.550 align:start position:0%
were going to be doing this I appreciate
that

04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
so so representative McKay just a
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
thought on that I didn't coordinate any
 
04:17:45.149 --> 04:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
of my prepared remarks uh with um with
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
your chairman he he he was clueless on
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say and probably
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
worried in the past when the chair is a
 
04:17:56.590 --> 04:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
when the chair is a sponsor the chair St
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
down okay I have
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
no that sounded like representative
 
04:18:04.590 --> 04:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
Weber was that for me sir no we're
 
04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
having a chat here does anyone have
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
Edwards representative Merchant and
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
Marsh my hand is not raised
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you for
 
04:18:30.429 --> 04:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
um is it my take from what you're
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
testifying that you're in support of of
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
a plan like we do in the Department of
 
04:18:42.030 --> 04:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation have a 10-year plan so we
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
actually look at things on a 10-year
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
Horizon and the same thing we do in
 
04:18:49.630 --> 04:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare um or you oppose to the
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
process to get to the plan and allow the
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner to have latitude to develop
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
the plan but we still want to plan I I I
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
think I'd say something sort of
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
different but very similar to your
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
second set of comments there
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I would say that
 
04:19:11.109 --> 04:19:11.119 align:start position:0%
it is um an inherent and vital task of a
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner to do strategic planning
 
04:19:17.550 --> 04:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
and to do strategic planning well uh and
 
04:19:20.109 --> 04:19:20.119 align:start position:0%
I think when we go out and we recruit
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
and we hire a commissioner for DHHS
 
04:19:25.469 --> 04:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
their ability to think strategically and
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
to act tactically is a huge part of the
 
04:19:28.439 --> 04:19:29.349 align:start position:0%
to act tactically is a huge part of the
job

04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
job
 
04:19:32.429 --> 04:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
qualifications so I just would not
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
legislatively bind his or her hands to
 
04:19:40.830 --> 04:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
stipulate exactly what the Contours of
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
that strategic plan ought to
 
04:19:46.349 --> 04:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
include or and and and sort of by
 
04:19:49.109 --> 04:19:49.119 align:start position:0%
assumption what it does not
 
04:19:51.790 --> 04:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
include Mr chair if I may
 
04:19:54.429 --> 04:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
chairman yes follow if I may to
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards I think we're saying
 
04:19:59.309 --> 04:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
the same thing um that we want to have a
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
plan yes legislatively we're basically
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
mandating a plan like we do in
 
04:20:03.600 --> 04:20:04.510 align:start position:0%
mandating a plan like we do in
Department

04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
transportation but I'm suppor of the
 
04:20:08.750 --> 04:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
fact we don't want to get into the nuts
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
and bolts of how that plan gets created
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
but we're more concerned with the
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
outcome than the
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
process so um as you know as you know
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
with me handing over this bill to the
 
04:20:24.510 --> 04:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee it's now your bill if if if
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
you were to say uh that there the that
 
04:20:29.830 --> 04:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
the part of the statute that demands
 
04:20:33.990 --> 04:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
that there be a a plan developed um I'd
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
be fine with that but I would suggest
 
04:20:39.830 --> 04:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that you pull out a lot of the kind of
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions and details and
 
04:20:44.670 --> 04:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
specifics that have gotten hardcoded
 
04:20:47.790 --> 04:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
into the bill or the legislation so that
 
04:20:52.269 --> 04:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has flexibility on on
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
on the Contours of the plan that's all
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's we're it's it's to it's too
 
04:20:57.239 --> 04:20:58.830 align:start position:0%
it's it's we're it's it's to it's too
much

04:20:58.830 --> 04:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
micromanagement put into law for me to
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
think it's good
 
04:21:08.189 --> 04:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
government thank you m representative
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
any other questions of the
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
Woods uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards for taking my
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
question um I'm looking at the back side
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
of your uh a printed testimony you sent
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
out and uh you referenced the uh IRC
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
articles um uh What uh facility is
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
performing each of these uh six tasks uh
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
and where does that information uh to
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
whom is that information
 
04:21:45.790 --> 04:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
transmitted so I understand that all 26
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
of Our Community Hospitals uh are
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
required to do this under the IRS code
 
04:21:55.630 --> 04:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
and that um uh its
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
distribution I I can't tell you I I have
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
got to imagine that a a copy would be
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
available to DHHS for the asking if it's
 
04:22:07.870 --> 04:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
not already
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
done but but there's an assumption in my
 
04:22:10.640 --> 04:22:11.790 align:start position:0%
done but but there's an assumption in my
answer

04:22:11.790 --> 04:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
sir okay well that would be interesting
 
04:22:17.550 --> 04:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
to follow up whether in fact the these
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
go to DHHS and currently are used for
 
04:22:24.269 --> 04:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
Statewide Community planning certainly
 
04:22:26.950 --> 04:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
each individual facility making a
 
04:22:30.109 --> 04:22:30.119 align:start position:0%
community plan uh would uh maybe differ
 
04:22:30.119 --> 04:22:31.030 align:start position:0%
community plan uh would uh maybe differ
rather

04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
substantially uh from a a Statewide uh
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
plan uh would seem would would that be
 
04:22:39.389 --> 04:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
correct I I I wouldn't I wouldn't
 
04:22:42.269 --> 04:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
dispute that I I would I would say that
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
when I talked to some members of DHHS uh
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
prior to this meeting uh there was
 
04:22:50.590 --> 04:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
concern that uh the department hadn't
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
been exercising effective leadership in
 
04:22:57.550 --> 04:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
this area and uh I believe that there
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
are other checks and balances in the
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
system that to the extent that this is a
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
a a priority and a smart thing to have a
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
strategic plan on that and that an
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
effective commissioner and the checks
 
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
properly thank you yes
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%

your presentation thank you very much I
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
I do hope that uh the committee has
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
received my written testimony that was
 
04:24:55.870 --> 04:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
submitted earlier this
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
morning um in that testimony I go into a
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper um
 
04:25:06.750 --> 04:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
explanation of the the wise
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
behind our current medical system and
 
04:25:11.109 --> 04:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
how it is Shifting towards a more
 
04:25:11.119 --> 04:25:12.510 align:start position:0%
how it is Shifting towards a more
value-based

04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
value-based
 
04:25:16.429 --> 04:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
um structure and um it's I I strongly
 
04:25:19.109 --> 04:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to to overview
 
04:25:23.229 --> 04:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
that um before I start uh my
 
04:25:26.149 --> 04:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
original comments I do want to address a
 
04:25:30.510 --> 04:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
couple of the um remarks that were made
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
um by uh the author of this bill um
 
04:25:37.710 --> 04:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
first of all all as a practicing
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
physician I want to clarify with um with
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
the committee that State Health
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
assessment State Health Improvement
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
plans are actually required by states to
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
do in addition to Regional or as we call
 
04:25:56.670 --> 04:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
them Community Health assessments and so
 
04:26:00.670 --> 04:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
these are typical processes that are um
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
best practices that are required um and
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
re and recommended um particular on the
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
public health standpoint for public
 
04:26:13.149 --> 04:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
health um structures to create a plan um
 
04:26:17.070 --> 04:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
longitudinally for um for their states
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
um so the the actual committee itself
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
however was
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
formed because exactly as um The
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
Honorable Mr Edwards mentioned because
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
our Health Care system is terribly
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
siloed we are
 
04:26:39.790 --> 04:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
working within a system in the United
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
States where as a country we spend over
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
twice as much per capita on Health Care
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
compared to other industrialized
 
04:26:50.710 --> 04:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
countries and our health care
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
outcomes um from life expectancy to
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
infant and maternal mortality are the
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
worst compared to our peers in the
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
world furthermore New Hampshire has the
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
fourth largest spending per capita on
 
04:27:12.910 --> 04:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
health care costs in the country and so
 
04:27:15.389 --> 04:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
we definitely have a problem and part of
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
that problem is because of the siloed
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
structure of our health care System
 
04:27:25.070 --> 04:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's known it's been done and it
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't been working and so the precise
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
reason as to Mr Edward's commentary as
 
04:27:34.030 --> 04:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
to why it is so important that we have a
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
convening of of um thought leaders who
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
are representative of the diverse and um
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
textured uh um community members that
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
comprise our state is absolutely
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
integral as a practicing physician I do
 
04:27:55.109 --> 04:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
not necessarily get Communications from
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
the public health standpoint on the
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that are made on how to
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
improve the general communities and
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
populations um Health that is not part
 
04:28:07.950 --> 04:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
of our current structure of systems the
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
second thing I'd like to point to the
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
committee's attention is that um as a
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
result public health plans don't
 
04:28:17.790 --> 04:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
collaborate with all of the other areas
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we know contribute to a patient's
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
health and
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
well-being um the last thing I want to
 
04:28:28.750 --> 04:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
um discuss is um he he mentioned an an
 
04:28:31.149 --> 04:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
interesting phrase of redundancy of
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
parallel universes and for those who
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
aren't practicing Physicians I want to
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
say welcome to my world as a practicing
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
Family Doctor Who on a day-to-day basis
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
I have to be on the front line and am
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
told and dictated by insurance companies
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
what medications to change my patients
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
on who have been um well controlled on
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
their chronic medications I'm constantly
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
barraged with laws and plans and
 
04:29:02.990 --> 04:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
policies that um that are made by people
 
04:29:05.109 --> 04:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
who are although well-intentioned may
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
not understand the downstream
 
04:29:09.229 --> 04:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
consequences of their decisions that
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
directly affect everyday Granite Staters
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis and so it is
 
04:29:19.389 --> 04:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
imperative that in this very um
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
complicated Health structure that we
 
04:29:23.790 --> 04:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
have both in New Hampshire and
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
nationally that we have a place where we
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
can convene all of the stakeholders that
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
are necessary in um in creating a well
 
04:29:34.720 --> 04:29:37.030 align:start position:0%
are necessary in um in creating a well
community

04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:29:40.149 --> 04:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
um It is Well understood and accepted
 
04:29:41.870 --> 04:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
within the medical and public health
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
spaces that the way to improve health
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
care outcomes reduce overall health care
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
spending and narrow disparities is to
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
shift our Focus From the current fee for
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
service alakar model of Health delivery
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
to a more Global preventative and
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
value-based care system and contrary to
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
some criticism this approach has
 
04:30:07.389 --> 04:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
actually proven to encourage healthy
 
04:30:10.349 --> 04:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
economic competition by incentivizing
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
high quality and lowcost Care in the
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
market in fact this is precisely why the
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
center for Medicaid and Medicare
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
Services has changed its reimbursement
 
04:30:22.269 --> 04:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
structure to incentivize robust Primary
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
Care delivery important population
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes and excuse me improved
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
population Health outcomes and bolster
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
coordination of care for patients and
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
this shift of medical re reimbursement
 
04:30:39.109 --> 04:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
has not only saved Medicare and private
 
04:30:42.389 --> 04:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
insurers billions literally dollars a
 
04:30:45.309 --> 04:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
year more over it means that Granite
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
Staters also will save money and have
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to direct the their care in
 
04:30:53.389 --> 04:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
the way that they see fit and so our
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
health and wellness encompasses all
 
04:30:58.710 --> 04:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
aspects of Our Lives as a matter of fact
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
um a p a person's health actually is
 
04:31:07.149 --> 04:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
dictated by more excuse me 80% of a
 
04:31:09.309 --> 04:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
person's health outcomes is actually
 
04:31:12.030 --> 04:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
derived outside of when I see them in
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
the doctor's out office that means how
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
they live work and play and so along
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
with its peers as a former Board of
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
director of the American Academy of
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
family physicians and a current member
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
of the aafp The Academy of family
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
physicians Commission on health of the
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
public in Sciences I strongly encourage
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
this committee to consider the vital ity
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
of the convening of the State Health
 
04:31:41.070 --> 04:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
assessment State Health Improvement plan
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
advisory Council as a result this is
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
actually a body that is
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary that reflects the
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
textured experience of the residents in
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
the state it puts into action the very
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations of our trusted leaders
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
that are bipartisan and both on the
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
health care and economic as well as
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
public health uh spectrums and certainly
 
04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
in the face of covid where we are seeing
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
such Stark Stark disparities it is
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
important to create a diverse bipartisan
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
and representative think tank that can
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
help Define what health and wellness
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
actually means for the faces of the New
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um residents and how they
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
experience an integrated and
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
concentrated um definition of Wellness
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
that is what this C this uh this group
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
is convening is doing it is taking the
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
already required State Health assessment
 
04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
and Improvement plan that is required of
 
04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
the state and we are actually taking it
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
into our hands as a state in a
 
04:32:48.510 --> 04:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort to look at all the
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
stakehold holders that we know affect
 
04:32:55.389 --> 04:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
health care and we are def defining what
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
health and what Wellness means for us
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
and more also we're going to create a
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
concerted effort where we're using the
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
same definitions hope Y and recommending
 
04:33:09.470 --> 04:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
to use the same processes so that we can
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
finally um we can finally have an
 
04:33:15.670 --> 04:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh compare Apples to
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
Apples because right now we have
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
multiple sectors in our economy in our
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare delivery structure within the
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
state that are speaking different
 
04:33:28.390 --> 04:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
languages although we have the same
 
04:33:30.789 --> 04:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
goals the New Hampshire Medical Society
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
is part of this group because our
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
members need integrated resources to
 
04:33:37.750 --> 04:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
help our patients stay out of the ER and
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
enjoy the wonderful amenities our state
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
has to offer I personally need to equip
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
my patient with diabetes who is recently
 
04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
unemployed due to
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 with resources to housing and
 
04:33:53.070 --> 04:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
Healthy nutrition for her to keep her
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
sugars controlled and out of and stay
 
04:33:55.869 --> 04:33:55.879 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
04:33:58.709 --> 04:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
hospital my my pediatric children that I
 
04:34:00.910 --> 04:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
take care of they need positive School
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
experiences to provide them a foundation
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
that they need to reach their unique
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
potential because we know by evidence
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
that appropriate education leads to
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
healthier adults so we need to weave a
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
supportive and comprehensive Network
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
that helps our patients be independent
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
and involved residents we cannot do
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
doing because what we've been doing has
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
not been working we've been spending
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
more we still have poor outcomes and we
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
still have disparate outcomes between
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
different groups in our state
 
04:34:37.949 --> 04:34:37.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Romas we've got some more
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%

04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
would thank you for your testimony I do
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
sir next I'm going to the chair is going
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
to call on Christine Stoddard
 
04:35:08.830 --> 04:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
from the bstate primary care Association
 
04:35:11.310 --> 04:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist it says and you're an
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:35:28.269 --> 04:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:35:30.390 --> 04:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
Christine Stoddard and I am the director
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire public policy for by
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
state Primary Care Association and for
 
04:35:38.109 --> 04:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
the new members of this committee by
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
state is a nonprofit 501c3 that works to
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
expand access to healthc care for all
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters regardless of insurance
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
status or ability to pay and as the
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
Association for the states of New
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont um we work
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
directly with community health centers
 
04:35:59.709 --> 04:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
in both States and in New Hampshire that
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
is 14 health centers with 56 locations
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
across the state and they serve
 
04:36:09.629 --> 04:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
approximately 120,000 patients we are
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 157 which would
 
04:36:15.070 --> 04:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
repeal the State Health Improvement plan
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
statutes and the State Health assessment
 
04:36:21.150 --> 04:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
and health Improvement plan advisory
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
Council and I think if the last year has
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
taught us anything there is no such
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
thing as too much planning when it comes
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
to Health Care addressing inequities in
 
04:36:33.070 --> 04:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
our Health Care system and making sure
 
04:36:35.470 --> 04:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
that people can access healthare when
 
04:36:38.349 --> 04:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
and where they need it I think two of
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the most important components in RSA
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
126 um a colon
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
87 is that the ship requires that the
 
04:36:49.709 --> 04:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
state focus on strategies to improve
 
04:36:52.269 --> 04:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
health outcomes and reduce inequities
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
and to strengthen public health and the
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
Human Service Delivery Systems the fqhcs
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
which are a subset of Community Health
 
04:37:02.349 --> 04:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
centers are required by federal law to
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
treat everyone regardless of insurance
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
stat St or ability to pay there there
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
are no exceptions to this Rule and so
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
the patient populations that they serve
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and across
 
04:37:16.189 --> 04:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
the country because that is a national
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
network are very different than the
 
04:37:21.070 --> 04:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
patients A lot of times that other
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
providers are serving and so they these
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
fqhcs and the community health centers
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
they provide primary and preventive
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
Medical Dental Oral mental health and
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
enabling services to um people across
 
04:37:37.349 --> 04:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
the United States and in New Hampshire
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
that means one in five uninsured Granite
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
Staters one in five Granite Staters who
 
04:37:44.590 --> 04:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in Medicaid 30% of their
 
04:37:47.230 --> 04:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
patients are Medicaid enroles 35%
 
04:37:50.670 --> 04:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
commercially insured 20% are Medicare
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
and 15% of their patients are um
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
uninsured and so as you can imagine by
 
04:37:58.990 --> 04:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
those patient demographics they look
 
04:38:00.830 --> 04:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
very different than what private
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
practices current usually serve um and
 
04:38:08.109 --> 04:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
so their work looks different as well
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
and I think the benefit of having ship
 
04:38:12.750 --> 04:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
is that you get a broad picture of what
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Health Care system is
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
who's being served who isn't being
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
served where the UN mean unmet needs are
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
and where we can do better and I think
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
to Doc I would just Echo what Dr Ras
 
04:38:29.189 --> 04:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
said she was spoton we have to have a
 
04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
broad understanding of what's going on
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
in our Health Care system and figure out
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
a way to fix it and address met needs
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what ship
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
accomplishes I I believe and as you can
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
tell from the statutes we do have a
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
member that sits on that um Council but
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
prior to this being codified in State
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Statute this group already existed and
 
04:38:52.349 --> 04:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
they were doing work behind the scenes
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
but the statute allows us to present
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
this information publicly have it
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
documented in a a more clear fashion and
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
have it open and available to the public
 
04:39:01.719 --> 04:39:03.590 align:start position:0%
have it open and available to the public
to

04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:08.429 --> 04:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
access um it's I I am not a community
 
04:39:10.910 --> 04:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
needs assessment expert and I'm I'm sure
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
that Paula minan is probably on this
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
committee listening to this testimony
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
and so I'd ask her to clarify um that
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
part of the statute but I would I would
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
just remind us that there is more to the
 
04:39:25.869 --> 04:39:25.879 align:start position:0%
Health Care system than the hospitals
 
04:39:28.590 --> 04:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
and the acute um care hospitals and Kirk
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
access hospitals in New Hampshire there
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
are other healthc care providers that
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
need to be considered and their patients
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
more most importantly as we design a
 
04:39:39.788 --> 04:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
Health Care system that works for
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
everyone and so um we would ask that the
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee recommend this bill in
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate so that the state
 
04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
can continue to look at the health care
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
system as a whole and address the needs
 
04:39:56.830 --> 04:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
and holes where they are so that we can
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
um begin continue to move forward and
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
prevent if we can pandemics like the one
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we're currently in so happy to
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if you have any
 
04:40:07.760 --> 04:40:12.948 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if you have any
take

04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:21.150 --> 04:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative gay
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair and
 
04:40:25.590 --> 04:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:40:28.590 --> 04:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
question why do you feel like you don't
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
have a voice without this
 
04:40:36.990 --> 04:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
if if you look at the and I'm sorry I'm
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
having a bit of a hard time hearing you
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm going to assume what you
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
asked and please correct me if I'm
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
wrong um if you look at the bill it
 
04:40:48.120 --> 04:40:49.110 align:start position:0%
wrong um if you look at the bill it
talks

04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
talks
 
04:40:51.788 --> 04:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
about the community needs assessment
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
being every three years performed by
 
04:40:54.840 --> 04:40:57.110 align:start position:0%
being every three years performed by
Community

04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hospitals I think that by having a ship
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
you get a broader view of what's going
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
on in the Health Care system because
 
04:41:08.190 --> 04:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
is healthc care providers treat very
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
different populations based on their
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
needs and so if you look at the patients
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
that are treated by an
 
04:41:16.628 --> 04:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
fqc and for those of you that don't know
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
fqhcs have to be located in what are
 
04:41:21.868 --> 04:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
called medically underserved areas which
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
means that there is a a shortage of
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
certain types of Health Care Providers
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
this could be in an urban area it could
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
be in a rural area in our
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
country it doesn't necessarily have to
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
be in a a um small city or town in
 
04:41:41.190 --> 04:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
northern New Hampshire they exist in
 
04:41:42.670 --> 04:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester as
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
well the ship allows you to have a
 
04:41:47.670 --> 04:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
broader view of what's happening and not
 
04:41:50.430 --> 04:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
just use the community needs assessment
 
04:41:53.230 --> 04:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mresa Shapiro has a
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry who has
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro representative
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro ask your
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um you
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
have described the very um idealistic
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
about idealistic Vision as did um Miss
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
Ras about um changes bold changes that
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
could come out of this Council
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
um which I would tend to um agree with
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
the need for those kinds of changes what
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
is the mechanism by which an advisory
 
04:42:51.070 --> 04:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
Council such as this actually
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
creates um change in the health
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
system so DHHS might be better able to
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
answer this question but our
 
04:43:03.948 --> 04:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
participants and by state has
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
participating did in this process in the
 
04:43:10.510 --> 04:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
past um find Value in that you have
 
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
voices that are managing our Healthcare
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
System um coming into a virtual room if
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
you will and and participate I'm sorry
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
my son is trying to break into my office
 
04:43:25.868 --> 04:43:25.878 align:start position:0%
give me a
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
second I apologize the fun of working
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
from home right with small children who
 
04:43:32.190 --> 04:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
are doing remote
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
School uh you have people participating
 
04:43:36.590 --> 04:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
ating in a in a virtual hearing and
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
hearing what is going on in the other
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
service areas and so you're able to have
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of what other
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
types of providers and populations are
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing have that documented and
 
04:43:52.750 --> 04:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
have the state be able to look back and
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
use that document as a Guiding Light to
 
04:43:57.628 --> 04:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
where we need to move the state
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
forward it also helps people um develop
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
an understanding of where we lacking and
 
04:44:08.110 --> 04:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
and as you know and as you've seen in
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
the news from the pandemic there are
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
populations even in New Hampshire that
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
are being very disproportionately
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
affected by the pandemic and the
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic's amplifying things that were
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
already happening and so by documenting
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
this we can um go back and reference it
 
04:44:27.788 --> 04:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
and move
 
04:44:32.190 --> 04:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
forward followup followup so what I
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
assume from what you've just said that
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
um it would be likely that there would
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
be ideas for legislation that would come
 
04:44:40.830 --> 04:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
Council that is how I would use it and I
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
I Envision that is how my members that
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
participate um view it it to me it is a
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
guide book and and how we can improve
 
04:44:54.750 --> 04:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
our service delivery system in New
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
questions is Senator Sherman on the
 
04:45:06.200 --> 04:45:07.230 align:start position:0%
questions is Senator Sherman on the
meeting

04:45:07.230 --> 04:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
yet yes he just texted me he is here now
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
and uh so he and I both are available
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
Sherman thank you Mr chair and uh as
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
always when I'm in house Health and
 
04:45:28.110 --> 04:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services and elderly Affairs I
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
feel back at
 
04:45:33.150 --> 04:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
home having served on the committee for
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
two terms
 
04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
um this is probably in my book one of
 
04:45:44.670 --> 04:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
the most important areas of work that we
 
04:45:44.680 --> 04:45:45.948 align:start position:0%
the most important areas of work that we
have

04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
done looking at how we deliver Health
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
Care in the state of New Hampshire I was
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
in the house when Co Sunset and this
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely to
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
co it's not regular
 
04:46:11.948 --> 04:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
it's not uh and so this is not uh Co
 
04:46:16.510 --> 04:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
related I also have participated in our
 
04:46:19.750 --> 04:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh assessments Community needs
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
assessments and while very effective it
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
targets each of the uh hospitals and
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
does not um does not look at the state
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
as a
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
whole um so so many years ago when I was
 
04:46:39.430 --> 04:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the house or several years ago we did
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh oh by the way I'm sorry I didn't
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
introduce myself I'm state senator Tom
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
Sherman District 24 11 towns on the Sea
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
Coast I'm also a practicing
 
04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
gastroenterologist at exitor
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
hospital um so when we did a um a hard
 
04:46:59.708 --> 04:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
look at healthare in New Hampshire one
 
04:47:01.628 --> 04:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
of the things that keeps coming back to
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
me is that there really is no way to
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
look at um not just health care but
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
wellness and
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
prevention um and support across all the
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
populations towns rural areas cities um
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
we just haven't done that as a state um
 
04:47:26.270 --> 04:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
except through this mechanism of State
 
04:47:27.548 --> 04:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
Health assessment and State Health
 
04:47:31.470 --> 04:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan so fundamentally the
 
04:47:34.830 --> 04:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
two drivers of this are one one to
 
04:47:38.830 --> 04:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
improve the health of the state by
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
looking at where there are gaps and
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
where there could be uh
 
04:47:47.708 --> 04:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
improvements but also how do we do that
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as possible how do we
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
look at where there may be redundancies
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
where there may be multiple people
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
working on the same process and that is
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
cost saving we have one of the most
 
04:48:05.788 --> 04:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
expensive healthare systems in the
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
country our state we spend more on
 
04:48:10.750 --> 04:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
health care our insurance is expensive
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
our cost sharing is
 
04:48:14.830 --> 04:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
prohibitive and there's a reason for
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
that and we don't understand all of the
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
reasons for that there are certainly
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
Insurance there are but this
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
understanding of how do we provide
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
support for people in public health and
 
04:48:31.708 --> 04:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
health care across the state is
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
something that really we we don't have a
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
good handle on but the State Health
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
assessment will allow us to pull that
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
together understand it um with no power
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
for regulation but certainly a power to
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
say well how can we do it that's what
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
the state health Improvement plan is all
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
about is how do we do a better job how
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
do we coordinate care how do we close
 
04:49:00.868 --> 04:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
gaps and none of that is telling anybody
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
what they have to
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
do it's making
 
04:49:06.150 --> 04:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's an advisory
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
Council but if successful the goal will
 
04:49:13.628 --> 04:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
be over time to lower the cost of Health
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
Care improve the quality and improve the
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency and that's why I think of
 
04:49:22.830 --> 04:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
this Council number one it is an amazing
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
group of people and I would invite any
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
of you to come join us at our next
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
meeting uh several of you actually sit
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
but it is an amazing group of people all
 
04:49:41.310 --> 04:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated to doing a better job of
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
providing health care and the provision
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
of Public Health in the state of New
 
04:49:49.590 --> 04:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one of my goals with this
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
is to have an understanding of how we do
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
that what are the inner connections and
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
can can we do a better job of those
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
connections but this is not
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
regulatory it's not telling people what
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
to do do it's understanding where we are
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
and making recommendations on how we can
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
do what we do
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
better with that I'm happy to take any
 
04:50:16.750 --> 04:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber thank you
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you senator for
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to see if you
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
could give us a little more clarity
 
04:50:28.350 --> 04:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
about how the statute that we're
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
proposing to repeal
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
works as I read it
 
04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
it says that the commissioner of the
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:50:43.548 --> 04:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
shall in consultation with the health
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and State Health Improvement
 
04:50:47.470 --> 04:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
plan and briery
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
Council develop a state health
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
assessment and a state health
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan so am I not correct in
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
thinking that the actual development of
 
04:51:02.788 --> 04:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
any plan is left to the commissioner and
 
04:51:07.708 --> 04:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
the role the council is advisory and
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
consultative you you are correct in that
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
much anyone else with a
 
04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Marshall's a
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
Marsh uh thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
you senator for appearing before our
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
committee it's a pleasure to see you
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
again and I want to apologize once again
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the scheduling conflicts that have
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
caused me to miss some of the uh uh
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment State Health
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan meetings but th this is
 
04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
my question um you you wrote this
 
04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and I would like to know if
 
04:51:48.270 --> 04:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
you feel the provisions of RSA 126a
 
04:51:51.230 --> 04:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
872 are sufficiently prescriptive to
 
04:51:53.110 --> 04:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
predetermine the outcome of the State
 
04:51:55.110 --> 04:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
Health assessment and do you see as
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
others have testified before us this
 
04:51:58.350 --> 04:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
morning that the State Health
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan is actually a vehicle
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
to legislate quote bold changes in our
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
say I would say it is a it's not really
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
a vehicle it's a vehicle for providing
 
04:52:20.430 --> 04:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations that are felt by The
 
04:52:23.830 --> 04:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
Advisory Council would be to the benefit
 
04:52:25.708 --> 04:52:25.718 align:start position:0%
of our system both the public health
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
system and the health care delivery
 
04:52:31.628 --> 04:52:31.638 align:start position:0%
system but not um some of them may not
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
be so bold some of them may be
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
just sort of oh this isn't happening you
 
04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
know some of the because we have really
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
very little idea of all the different
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
facets and all the
 
04:52:52.590 --> 04:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
different uh types of of Public Health
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
and Health Care delivery in our state
 
04:52:56.548 --> 04:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
which is part of the assessment portion
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
of this we have we we will likely find
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
areas where tweaks are necessary where
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
connections are need to be made um
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
others there may be bold recommendations
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
but I tend to think a little more on the
 
04:53:17.708 --> 04:53:17.718 align:start position:0%
also on the pragmatic side you know what
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
else can we learn well suppose we learn
 
04:53:23.708 --> 04:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
that there's a community that has no
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
access to some type of health care
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's mental health substance use
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
those kind of things and we didn't
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
previously recognize this that's not
 
04:53:32.958 --> 04:53:34.150 align:start position:0%
previously recognize this that's not
bold

04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
bold
 
04:53:37.150 --> 04:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
that's filling a gap and in the end
 
04:53:39.990 --> 04:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
filling that Gap will decrease the cost
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire because of
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
all the costs of untreated illness so I
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
see it as uh I think there's a lot of
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
possible outcomes we may also find that
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
we do everything perfectly and nothing
 
04:53:53.440 --> 04:53:54.150 align:start position:0%
we do everything perfectly and nothing
is

04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:53:56.670 --> 04:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
needed right so
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's I I don't go into this with a with
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
an answer I go into it with a question
 
04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm hoping to come out
 
04:54:08.350 --> 04:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
with are some answers to the
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions but I don't know all the
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
questions that's part of the beauty of
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
of an assessment is that you find out
 
04:54:17.070 --> 04:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
things if you do it correctly which I
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
believe they're doing a phenomenal job
 
04:54:21.548 --> 04:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
you find out things that you never knew
 
04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily were a problem but you also
 
04:54:26.190 --> 04:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
find that you're doing other things
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
really really well uh one other benefit
 
04:54:32.190 --> 04:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
to this is that if you do a Statewide
 
04:54:33.708 --> 04:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
assessment one of the problems with
 
04:54:37.470 --> 04:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
Healthcare in almost the entire
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
country is that we
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
are um is that it tends to be very
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
local so somebody may be doing a really
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
great job with a really Innovative
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
system in one part of the state and the
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
other part of the state doesn't know
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
that that's happening so that's why
 
04:55:00.990 --> 04:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
doing a Statewide Health
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
assessment is something where we all o
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
can see who's doing a great job can we
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
help another part of the state use that
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
as a model for the other part of the
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
state and do
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
Improvement not by Reinventing the wheel
 
04:55:20.590 --> 04:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
program thank you Senator and Mr
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
chairman may I have a followup May uh
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I agree with you I
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
really would like to see our health care
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
System improved um and uh I I do look
 
04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
forward to thing that happened one way
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
or the other but one of the issues that
 
04:55:38.590 --> 04:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
I think many members see with this bill
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
is that this legislation never had a
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
house hearing and the house members
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
never truly participated in the
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
development of the charge to this uh
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
Council uh and perhaps the uh committee
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
might consider using this bill as a
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
vehicle to tweak that charge in such a
 
04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
way that uh it may more broadly reflect
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
the concerns of all the members of our
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee is that something that you
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
could support and would you be willing
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
to work with us in doing that I'd be
 
04:56:12.510 --> 04:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
happy to uh look at um the yeah you know
 
04:56:14.548 --> 04:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
there there were several pieces of
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that Co kind of steered a
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
different direction and certainly the
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
bill was intended to come before both
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
Chambers fully and have input um I would
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
much prefer to see a bill improved than
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
repealed when I believe it's doing great
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
great work to start out with so I would
 
04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
be absolutely open
 
04:56:42.750 --> 04:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
to um possible changes that would
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
improve the work we're doing but I think
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
the work we're doing and you're a part
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
of that is really a great job what I
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
would not want to see this become is is
 
04:56:57.948 --> 04:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
a Regulatory Commission I don't think
 
04:57:00.548 --> 04:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate role I think the
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
advisory component is where we should be
 
04:57:07.470 --> 04:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
sitting um but I do think there there
 
04:57:09.548 --> 04:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
may be other things that certainly I
 
04:57:11.310 --> 04:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
didn't think of or the commission hasn't
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
thought of yet that you all may come up
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
with that you'd like to see looked at as
 
04:57:19.948 --> 04:57:19.958 align:start position:0%
well by the commission by the council I
 
04:57:22.110 --> 04:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
I thank you for that and I see that as
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
being an excellent outcome of this bill
 
04:57:26.350 --> 04:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
so I would support that as well so thank
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
you very
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%

organization that Advocates educates and

wellness of all New Hampshire residents
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh as you can tell it's been a while
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
since I've been in front of a committee
 
04:58:34.590 --> 04:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
because uh roll off my tongue um
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be here with you
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
today and I appreciate the opportunity
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:58:44.670 --> 04:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
testify um this this afternoon um new
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
Futures is in opposition to House Bill
 
04:58:48.320 --> 04:58:51.708 align:start position:0%
Futures is in opposition to House Bill
157

04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
um understand that the house um feels
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
that they did not have any input on this
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh in this particular bill because of
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
everything that happened last year um so
 
04:59:05.310 --> 04:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
you know our position obviously reflects
 
04:59:08.590 --> 04:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
um the bill that came uh before you and
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
that is before you um certainly not uh
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh's uh recommendation
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
at at looking at modifying the
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
statute um I don't want to take up too
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
much of your time because one I sent you
 
04:59:24.150 --> 04:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony and two the folks that
 
04:59:26.110 --> 04:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
went before me know a lot more about
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
this stuff than I do but I did just want
 
04:59:31.628 --> 04:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
to to point out the fact that
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
um there's a reason that the community
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
needs assessments are in the IRS code
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
and that is because it is a requirement
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the nonprofit
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals um to participate in that
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
process and I know if if uh Paula
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
minahan is on your list behind me I'm
 
04:59:57.670 --> 04:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
sure she can explain this more fully to
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
you but there are three hospitals um
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
particularly ports Portsmouth Regional
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hospital Parkland in Dairy and uh
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
frisbee in Rochester that are four
 
05:00:11.680 --> 05:00:12.708 align:start position:0%
frisbee in Rochester that are four
profit

05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
profit
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
entities those entities do not have to
 
05:00:18.788 --> 05:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
do a community needs
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
assessment um so if
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
the state was to
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
Simply compile the community needs
 
05:00:31.788 --> 05:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
assessments done by the hospitals we'd
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
be have some huge gaps um around the
 
05:00:35.680 --> 05:00:36.628 align:start position:0%
be have some huge gaps um around the
state

05:00:36.628 --> 05:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:00:36.638 --> 05:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
state
particularly

05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
in uh the Sea Coast Area in both
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmith and Rochester and uh right and
 
05:00:49.948 --> 05:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
dairy um which are are pretty uh
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
populated places um those areas no
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
longer have a community needs assessment
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
being done unless those hospitals are
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
doing them voluntarily it certainly is
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
not a
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
requirement um so so this is not a
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
complete duplicative process uh by any
 
05:01:09.670 --> 05:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
means and also um I think as was
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I just want to hammer home
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
the point that um you can't really take
 
05:01:18.270 --> 05:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
all of the need these needs assessments
 
05:01:21.030 --> 05:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
put them on a table and see what's going
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
on in the state because you they're not
 
05:01:26.948 --> 05:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
comparing Apples to Apples um you're
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
comparing apples to grapes and so you
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't really have a sense of what the
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
whole picture look looks like around the
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
state if you're simply taking 23
 
05:01:40.948 --> 05:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
individual needs assessments that are
 
05:01:45.390 --> 05:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
being done as a basically an exchange um
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
for being considered nonprofit not
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
having to pay an income tax um many of
 
05:01:51.718 --> 05:01:53.628 align:start position:0%
having to pay an income tax um many of
the

05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
services um and or activities that the
 
05:02:00.590 --> 05:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
hospital hospitals provide in exchange
 
05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
are Financial type um
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
activities um and again I hope Paula is
 
05:02:09.190 --> 05:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
on this call to be able to explain this
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh more fully than I do because I don't
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
want to step on her toes um or say
 
05:02:15.868 --> 05:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
anything that's uh contrary to what the
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
hospital uh Association would say about
 
05:02:21.310 --> 05:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
their members um but I think that the
 
05:02:23.310 --> 05:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
community needs assessments would be
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
lacking a lot of information um that the
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
State State Health assessment wouldn't
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
be lacking so I just want to you know
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
wrap up by saying first you know you
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
have my written testimony um would
 
05:02:41.310 --> 05:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read it if you have any
 
05:02:45.190 --> 05:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
questions certainly reach out to me um
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
secondly um as uh Christine alluded to
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
but I just want to uh expand a little
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
bit that you know if there's anything
 
05:02:57.548 --> 05:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
that the ongoing addiction crisis Mental
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
Health crisis and covid-19 pandemic have
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
taught us it is that New Hampshire could
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
benefit from having a stakeholder
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
engaged process that's overseen by the
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to assess and develop a plan
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to improve health outcomes reduce reduce
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
Health disparities and strengthen Public
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service Delivery
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
Systems and codifying the council
 
05:03:26.708 --> 05:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
codifying the Shaw and the ship is the
 
05:03:29.190 --> 05:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
only way to make sure that that's done
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it's done with
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight um and with that
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
um just simply ask that as it's written
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
um we request that the committee um Vote
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
itl or inexpedient to legislate on House
 
05:03:46.480 --> 05:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
itl or inexpedient to legislate on House
Bill

05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
157 um however if there is an appetite
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
to look at doing a an amendment to add
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
to it um uh with the House's input
 
05:04:01.270 --> 05:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know new Futures would
 
05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
consider being in support of that um if
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
we were able to see the amendment so
 
05:04:08.548 --> 05:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
with that uh concludes my testimony and
 
05:04:10.510 --> 05:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions if anybody has
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.440 --> 05:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:41.230 align:start position:0%
 
can

05:04:41.230 --> 05:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:41.240 --> 05:04:43.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:04:43.390 --> 05:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um seeing that there are no
 
05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
questions the chair calls recognizes
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
DHHS

05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.430 --> 05:05:18.440 align:start position:0%

05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%

directs DHHS through the work of a
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
multi- sector Council of subject matter
 
05:06:32.190 --> 05:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
expert and leaders within their fields
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
to to complete a state health assessment
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
and State Health Improvement plan for
 
05:06:38.190 --> 05:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire you also
 
05:06:40.750 --> 05:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
received a membership list uh with uh my
 
05:06:42.390 --> 05:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
testimony so that you can see the
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
membership of uh this particular Council
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
and um uh the fact that it uh it's a
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
broad geography as well as a broad uh
 
05:06:51.200 --> 05:06:52.830 align:start position:0%
broad geography as well as a broad uh
sectoral

05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
sectoral
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
representation this law creates an
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
assurance that the department regardless
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
of leadership will use a datadriven
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
inclusive process for assessing planning
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
implementing monitoring Improvement in
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of New
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population legislative
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
oversight of this process further aligns
 
05:07:15.150 --> 05:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
the planning with budget and policy
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
priorities HB 157 identifies two points
 
05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
of concerns that I would like to address
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's true that Community Hospitals by
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
law must complete Community needs
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
assessments every three years the
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
concern is stated in HP 157 is that the
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment is duplicative
 
05:07:35.830 --> 05:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
of this process rather than being
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
duplicative a state health assessment
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
Aggregates and aligns Community
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
strengths while identifying
 
05:07:43.948 --> 05:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities for more efficient and
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
effective use of State resources across
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
state agencies over the past seven years
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
our community public health networks
 
05:07:54.510 --> 05:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
across the state have collaborated with
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
some hospitals and Community leaders in
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
performing Community needs assessment as
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
required by federal and state statute
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
for hot nonprofit hospitals if we
 
05:08:06.190 --> 05:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
already we've already discussed
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
information obtained from these
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
assessments are utilized in the
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
development of Regional Community Health
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans rather than being
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
duplicative the health assessment and
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
health Improvement plan provide needed
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
data for completion of these Regional
 
05:08:21.868 --> 05:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
assessments and as stated earlier
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
Aggregates and aligns community straints
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
and identifies opportunities for more
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective use of State
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
resources across state agencies um it's
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
also important to mention that not all
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals um uh participate in this
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
community needs assessment process that
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
some hospitals do this uh with their
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
communities and some hospitals do it in
 
05:08:46.990 --> 05:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
isolation of their communities the
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
reason that they do it is stated earlier
 
05:08:51.670 --> 05:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
is because it's required by by law both
 
05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
federal and state law the goal for the
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
completion of these assessments is for
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals to do community benefits plans
 
05:09:02.670 --> 05:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
um these are plans that are that are uh
 
05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
Focus solely on um hospitals and the
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
work that hospitals will do um alone uh
 
05:09:11.548 --> 05:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes with communities other times
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
um in terms of where they will put some
 
05:09:16.030 --> 05:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
of their
 
05:09:18.350 --> 05:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
resources the other point of concern
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
identified in HB 157 is regarding the
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
certificate of need process which was
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
repealed in
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
2016 the State Health assessment will
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
focus on four categories health status
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
in outcomes access to opportunity
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
community and social connectivity it
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
will highlight birth outcomes vaccine
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
rates chronic disease and health status
 
05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
and will focus on access utilization un
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
cost certificate of need will not be
 
05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
considered as part of this process we
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
all benefit from a predictable structure
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
for which data driven priority setting
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh is built by building transparent
 
05:09:57.548 --> 05:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
routine and consistent process for
 
05:09:59.708 --> 05:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
assessment driven by experts in their
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
fields will be able to set and achieve
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
ambitious goals and drive Innovation I
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
speak for the Department and ask you for
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
your support to continue this important
 
05:10:12.350 --> 05:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
work as codified in the rsas for the New
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Health assessment and
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plan and I'd
 
05:10:18.190 --> 05:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
like to end by talking about the
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
leadership within the department as
 
05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um our commissioner
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
and all our leadership believes that um
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's important for us uh to get input
 
05:10:30.750 --> 05:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
from um uh subject matter expert and
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
leaders across the state in various
 
05:10:36.510 --> 05:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
representing various sectors to ensure
 
05:10:40.030 --> 05:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
that uh when we um have and finalize a
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
community health Improvement plan um
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
that um it has uh it is in it has uh as
 
05:10:50.310 --> 05:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
part of it and included in it um all of
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
the areas um uh of expertise um through
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh with the goal of improving Health
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes so I'll stop right here and
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you may have any
 
05:11:01.520 --> 05:11:10.910 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you may have any
questions

05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
represent I'm curious as to what are
 
05:11:13.840 --> 05:11:17.150 align:start position:0%
represent I'm curious as to what are
your

05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
concrete after you do assessments which
 
05:11:23.190 --> 05:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
I can assume is an ongoing
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
thing what do you do with your
 
05:11:31.548 --> 05:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
discussions what actions do you suggest
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
what is the value add of the information
 
05:11:38.548 --> 05:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
with so um thank you for that question
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh so I heard most of it I believe but
 
05:11:46.990 --> 05:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
um after the assessment what we'll do is
 
05:11:49.590 --> 05:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look we'll have all the
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
assessment information analyzed and from
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that assessment information we'll
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
identify priorities within the state uh
 
05:12:00.190 --> 05:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
based upon the needs that's identified
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
and we will take those needs and we will
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
begin to address what some of the plans
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
are uh that will meet those priorities
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
and needs we will uh look at and
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
incorporate the existing uh state plan
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
so we have a state plan on Aging we have
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
a 10-year Mental Health Plan um uh we
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
will take those existing plans where in
 
05:12:23.150 --> 05:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
the development of a housing and
 
05:12:25.548 --> 05:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
homeless plan we will take those plans
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
and incorporate them into the final
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plan so we are
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
not um uh re inventing the wheel uh we
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
hope that uh what will come of this uh
 
05:12:39.548 --> 05:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
may be will be a better integrated
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
system uh we will work more efficiently
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
right now uh we tend to um work in uh I
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
think across the state in uh more siloed
 
05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
ways although uh Regional planning is
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
becoming uh more present than it has
 
05:12:57.788 --> 05:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
been in the future but this will further
 
05:13:00.270 --> 05:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
um enhance that integrated work that we
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
do on the state level but also on the
 
05:13:05.070 --> 05:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
community level and uh although this is
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
a DHHS plan uh this is actually the
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
state plan for New Hampshire which uh
 
05:13:12.910 --> 05:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
incorporates other departments across
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh into the
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
final draft of the plan um so
 
05:13:20.708 --> 05:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
communities can use this information as
 
05:13:23.230 --> 05:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
they are developing their Regional plans
 
05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
um and also um for the legislature to
 
05:13:28.110 --> 05:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at to see how we can
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate uh some of the uh the state
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
St Health Improvement um goals and
 
05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
objectives into legislation when needed
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
um but really what this is is this is um
 
05:13:44.070 --> 05:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
a um a a guide book for change as
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh a mandate for
 
05:13:54.270 --> 05:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
question well I was just wondering of
 
05:13:59.548 --> 05:13:59.558 align:start position:0%
what sort of suggestions do you make is
 
05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
it like well you need another hospital
 
05:14:05.788 --> 05:14:05.798 align:start position:0%
here you need a another clinic here or
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
you need more providers who need a
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
certain need like drug
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
addiction yeah I'm interested in the
 
05:14:16.830 --> 05:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
concrete things that you're trying to
 
05:14:16.840 --> 05:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
concrete things that you're trying to
make

05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
happen sure so you know we're just in
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
the process of uh compiling information
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
for our for the health assessment the
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
health assessment and its analysis will
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
guide uh the development of the State
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan um and that
 
05:14:37.270 --> 05:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan uh will provide
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the department and
 
05:14:41.708 --> 05:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
across the state and two communities
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
around sort of uh around the goals and
 
05:14:46.548 --> 05:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
objectives um and priorities they should
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
be looking towards so I don't want to uh
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
I don't I I I don't know uh what that uh
 
05:14:54.910 --> 05:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan is going to say
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
um uh we will be utilizing um
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
evidencebased and promising practices uh
 
05:15:01.320 --> 05:15:02.430 align:start position:0%
evidencebased and promising practices uh
in

05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:15:05.548 --> 05:15:05.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations um you know an example
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
um could be um uh as somebody had
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh you know looking at
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
where there are gaps in certain Services
 
05:15:19.270 --> 05:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire um uh
 
05:15:22.030 --> 05:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
are all vulner are all populations
 
05:15:25.470 --> 05:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
having the same access uh to care uh so
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
it could be uh there would be a variety
 
05:15:30.788 --> 05:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
of uh recommendations based upon uh the
 
05:15:32.670 --> 05:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
priorities based upon the health
 
05:15:36.628 --> 05:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.110 --> 05:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mrs moris I I'm
 
05:15:55.230 --> 05:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
wondering what is the extent if any of a
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
partnership between this Council and the
 
05:16:04.590 --> 05:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:07.150 --> 05:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
can can can you uh somebody repeat that
 
05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
question I apologize I could not hear I
 
05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
heard Regional Planning Commission I
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
heard partnership but that's all I heard
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
now um I was just wondering what is the
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
extent of a relationship if there is one
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
um between this Council and the New
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire region Regional planning
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
commissions so we do have representation
 
05:16:38.430 --> 05:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
from the municipal Association but I
 
05:16:40.270 --> 05:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
think uh we don't have anybody from the
 
05:16:41.788 --> 05:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions and I
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
think that's a a great um thought is to
 
05:16:48.430 --> 05:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh pull uh Regional Planning Commission
 
05:16:52.110 --> 05:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
membership in or uh to ensure that um as
 
05:16:55.070 --> 05:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
we provide Outreach to the communities
 
05:16:59.830 --> 05:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
um to um address their needs um through
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
conversation um that we would uh be able
 
05:17:04.030 --> 05:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
to pull them in at that time that's
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
you did representative Merchant have a
 
05:17:14.030 --> 05:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
question yes Mr chairman thank you um my
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
question to director
 
05:17:19.628 --> 05:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
Morris I think we're all in agreement
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
that healthc care system we have today
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
is very
 
05:17:24.990 --> 05:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
fragmented I want to commend this bill
 
05:17:27.310 --> 05:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
for pulling together stakeholders from
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
various silos to have a healthy
 
05:17:30.350 --> 05:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
conversation I think sharing that
 
05:17:32.990 --> 05:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge is very very constructive
 
05:17:34.590 --> 05:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
however I've heard a couple of times
 
05:17:37.548 --> 05:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
that it's datadriven evidence Bas if you
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
will so my question to yourself or
 
05:17:44.110 --> 05:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
someone else on this group what data is
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
being collected to help guide
 
05:17:49.310 --> 05:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based decision making and how
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
does one go about collecting that
 
05:17:56.590 --> 05:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
data so um we have a contracted with uh
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
UNH Institute of Health policy and
 
05:18:03.548 --> 05:18:03.558 align:start position:0%
practice to um work with us to um
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
identify what areas that we want to
 
05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
assess and uh as um Senator Sherman
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned I encourage you to attend one
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the meetings we really have um uh
 
05:18:17.708 --> 05:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
some robust conversations um and we take
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
the time that's needed to be able to
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
think this through well so there are
 
05:18:25.470 --> 05:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
many um data sources that we're looking
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
at uh across the Health Care System
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
across the social service system um and
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
even outside of those systems to be able
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
to um uh compile data uh that we feel is
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to get and understand
 
05:18:43.390 --> 05:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh what's happening in the across the
 
05:18:45.788 --> 05:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but we're also
 
05:18:48.910 --> 05:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
survey we're also Pro doing Outreach to
 
05:18:51.070 --> 05:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
different communities uh within the
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
state so right now uh we will be sending
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
out a survey through the UNH Survey
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
Center that has been vetted for many
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
weeks by uh the council um
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
and um that provides not sort of
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
perceptive information around um
 
05:19:11.070 --> 05:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
people's perceptive and actual
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
information around people's experiences
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of um accessing uh the
 
05:19:20.150 --> 05:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
health care and um other areas that we
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
know lead to um to health outcomes um
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
after that we are going to be uh
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
reaching out into the community during
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
covid it's made it uh much more
 
05:19:30.480 --> 05:19:31.830 align:start position:0%
covid it's made it uh much more
complicated

05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh to different uh uh different groups
 
05:19:37.270 --> 05:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
within communities to be able to have
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
deeper level conversations with them
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible that um that we will
 
05:19:48.270 --> 05:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh that the the first um State Health uh
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh Improvement plan will identify gaps
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the data that we have and part of the
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
priorities may be to um identify ways
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
that we can um uh we can access that
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
data so um uh if there are gaps in our
 
05:20:07.868 --> 05:20:07.878 align:start position:0%
understanding so that we can have uh
 
05:20:11.390 --> 05:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
good planning for the future um so um
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices so for um for
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
just about every every sector every uh
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
social and uh Health Care uh entity
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
there are evidence-based practices
 
05:20:26.430 --> 05:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
there's also promising practices uh that
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh may not yet be evidence-based that
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at um and as Senator
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
Sher I believe it was Senator Sherman
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
who said there may be really wonderful
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
things going on with really good
 
05:20:38.270 --> 05:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes um in certain areas of the
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
state that we want to know about um and
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
replicate throughout the rest of the
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire or at least
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
inform others in the state of New
 
05:20:47.948 --> 05:20:47.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about those promising
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
practices Mr chairman if I may make a
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
comment followup yes um what I'm hearing
 
05:20:55.440 --> 05:20:56.510 align:start position:0%
comment followup yes um what I'm hearing
is

05:20:56.510 --> 05:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:21:01.390 --> 05:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
that the proposed bill would only allow
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
for information coming from the
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
IRS um Community needs assessment and I
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
think what I'm what I've heard is that
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
the robustness of what's being collected
 
05:21:15.628 --> 05:21:15.638 align:start position:0%
far exceeds those data
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
elements um and therefore it sounds like
 
05:21:21.470 --> 05:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
we're taking the opportunity potentially
 
05:21:24.030 --> 05:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
here to narrow down the data that we're
 
05:21:25.708 --> 05:21:25.718 align:start position:0%
going to collect to only that with
 
05:21:27.628 --> 05:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
Community assessments and that's only
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
for not for profit houss thank you
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:40.830 align:start position:0%
for not for profit houss thank you
sir

05:21:40.830 --> 05:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
any further questions and please make
 
05:21:45.070 --> 05:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
sure there questions we'll have time in
 
05:21:48.750 --> 05:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
the exec session to um give Reflections
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:00.548 --> 05:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
anyone in the which case thank you very
 
05:22:00.558 --> 05:22:01.470 align:start position:0%
anyone in the which case thank you very
much

05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
um is Morris and the chair now
 
05:22:07.628 --> 05:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh well before I recognize
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
anybody just please uh we've gone on a
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
long time and we've heard a lot and I
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how much more new there is to
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
hear so if you have anything new that
 
05:22:21.628 --> 05:22:21.638 align:start position:0%
you can add to this that doesn't repeat
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
and underscore uh that would be very
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh with that the chair
 
05:22:32.430 --> 05:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh representative Jerry kerk
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Mr chair can
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay yeah okay great um Yes
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
actually I did want to go back I I sent
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
some written testimony complete with
 
05:22:44.830 --> 05:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
some graphs and so on but I do want to
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
actually move a little bit into
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
something else for a moment and that is
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
the that indeed a lot of
 
05:22:54.270 --> 05:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
12687 was misrepresented in the in the
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
bill introduction because indeed it says
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
clearly that it's a consultative body it
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
is indeed called an advisory Council for
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
a reason it is not regulatory it has uh
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
it is not certificate of need and that
 
05:23:11.430 --> 05:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
is uh so that was a problem as also
 
05:23:13.628 --> 05:23:13.638 align:start position:0%
stated by representative Edwards that it
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
was huge and unwieldy it's not unwieldy
 
05:23:18.750 --> 05:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
at all we've had a very good turnout at
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
each of our meetings oh I should say I'm
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
sorry for the record I'm representative
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
Jerry kerk I'm a retired uh orthopedic
 
05:23:26.350 --> 05:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
surgeon I'm also currently the vice
 
05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair of the sh ship advisory Council
 
05:23:32.110 --> 05:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's not un wieldy the large
 
05:23:34.628 --> 05:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
membership lends A diversity of opinions
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
that will allow a development of a much
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive assessment and plan
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
than we would get from just the
 
05:23:43.868 --> 05:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals um so anyway the the main
 
05:23:44.830 --> 05:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
thing to understand and I'm going to
 
05:23:46.350 --> 05:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
take a slightly different tack on this
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
than some of the other people there's an
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
assertion in the statement of intent of
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
HP 1557 that allowing increased
 
05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
competition will reduce health care
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
costs but that is simply not true and
 
05:23:58.350 --> 05:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
anybody that has looked at any of the
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
international um data knows that the
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
United States has the most free market
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
competitive Health Care system of all
 
05:24:07.910 --> 05:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
the developed countries but the
 
05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
comparison demonstrate that again as Dr
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
Rama said we spend twice as much as
 
05:24:13.750 --> 05:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
other developed countries with the
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
poorest outcomes and I have some rather
 
05:24:18.430 --> 05:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
interesting intelling graphs over time
 
05:24:19.708 --> 05:24:19.718 align:start position:0%
uh which I sent out in my written
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
testimony for uh just the simple thing
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
of our what we spend and our life
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
expectancy we're at the top for spending
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom for life expectency
 
05:24:30.830 --> 05:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
expectancy now the point of that is very
 
05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
simple competition and free markets work
 
05:24:36.750 --> 05:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
great for Consumer products where you
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
can shop for the best deal and decide
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
not to purchase an item if the price is
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
too high but healthc care is not that
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's infrastructure it doesn't function
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
like a free market and even if we solve
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
the problem of cost transparency it is
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult to do comparison shopping
 
05:24:53.788 --> 05:24:53.798 align:start position:0%
you're lying in an emergency room with a
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
broken ankle heart attack or an inflamed
 
05:24:58.548 --> 05:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
appendix and you can't choose not to
 
05:25:00.788 --> 05:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
purchase the appendectomy you need just
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
because the price is tooo high so again
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
the goal of this plan this assessment
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
group and plan is to improve health care
 
05:25:10.350 --> 05:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes and strengthen Delivery Systems
 
05:25:12.190 --> 05:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
if we work on improving management of
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
chronic illness we will save substantial
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
health care costs by preventing
 
05:25:18.670 --> 05:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
avoidable hospitalizations and that's
 
05:25:21.310 --> 05:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
the phraseology that is usually used for
 
05:25:22.990 --> 05:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
example it's far cheaper to treat
 
05:25:25.230 --> 05:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
hypertension with a cheap generic
 
05:25:27.190 --> 05:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
anti-hypertensive than it is to treat a
 
05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
stroke that results from the
 
05:25:30.628 --> 05:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled hypertension that includes
 
05:25:32.670 --> 05:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
clud the costly acute care the
 
05:25:34.708 --> 05:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and the long-term
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
disability I do find it particularly
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
troubling to see this bill come forward
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
when Co has clearly revealed the
 
05:25:44.230 --> 05:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
weakness of our fragmented competitive
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
free market system that has led to some
 
05:25:48.430 --> 05:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
of the worst outcomes in the world and
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
is endangering all of us it's not a
 
05:25:52.190 --> 05:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
matter of only endangering those who
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't have access it endangers all of us
 
05:25:57.030 --> 05:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
by increasing the spread of Co of the
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
the virus now the other thing that I
 
05:26:01.708 --> 05:26:01.718 align:start position:0%
here's this angle that I'm want to hit
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
on this because since I think doc Jess
 
05:26:06.190 --> 05:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
Edwards was specifically talking about
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
the free market issue and about how this
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
was against that it really isn't because
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
if we do accept our current policy of
 
05:26:14.750 --> 05:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
free marketing financing for the
 
05:26:16.350 --> 05:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
significant portion of our health care
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
System the data that ship generates for
 
05:26:22.390 --> 05:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
improving healthc care delivery will
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
actually assist competition it states
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
clearly in section 126
 
05:26:30.868 --> 05:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
a87 that this information is public
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
publicly available and it is a public
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
resource for decision making the bottom
 
05:26:39.788 --> 05:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
line is the nonprofits hospitals Health
 
05:26:42.628 --> 05:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
Care Systems providers and insurers will
 
05:26:44.030 --> 05:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
be able to make use of the data to
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
determine how to deliver Health Care in
 
05:26:49.150 --> 05:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
a more cost-effective fashion and
 
05:26:52.430 --> 05:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
thereby decrease costs and increase
 
05:26:54.670 --> 05:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
quality so if we look at our current
 
05:26:56.990 --> 05:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
feif for service system that pays for
 
05:27:00.670 --> 05:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
production uh rather than uh healthare
 
05:27:02.590 --> 05:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
rather than Healthcare outcomes there's
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
no incentive for providers to control
 
05:27:06.990 --> 05:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
costs so what's the people that have
 
05:27:09.070 --> 05:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
stepped in center for Medicare and
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services and the insurers they
 
05:27:13.750 --> 05:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
have had to step in to try to lead the
 
05:27:15.948 --> 05:27:15.958 align:start position:0%
way and trying to control costs with
 
05:27:18.750 --> 05:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
various payment reforms and value-based
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
payment reforms such as an Accountable
 
05:27:22.750 --> 05:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
Care Organization that holds providers
 
05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
accountable for outcomes will drive
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
competition amongst providers for cost a
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
effective delivery of healthare so
 
05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
indeed this the work that's being done
 
05:27:38.190 --> 05:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
by this is not anti-competitive it is
 
05:27:40.510 --> 05:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
not anti-free Market it actually will
 
05:27:42.990 --> 05:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
enhance the free market competition by
 
05:27:45.310 --> 05:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
giving this data to the provider groups
 
05:27:47.788 --> 05:27:47.798 align:start position:0%
and to the insurers so they can begin to
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
then develop systems that work the most
 
05:27:52.750 --> 05:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
effectively I think you all know that I
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
would really very much prefer that we
 
05:27:56.830 --> 05:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
not have an insurance-based system but
 
05:27:58.510 --> 05:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we got and this doesn't go
 
05:28:01.548 --> 05:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
against it it helps it it'll help gather
 
05:28:03.310 --> 05:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
and drive the decision- making gather
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
data to drive the decision- making as to
 
05:28:08.470 --> 05:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
where the efficiencies can be realized
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
for both insurers and
 
05:28:12.708 --> 05:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
providers the bottom line is the
 
05:28:14.948 --> 05:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
advisory Council should finish its task
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
to provide data to guide our decisions
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative kerk any
 
05:28:25.990 --> 05:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:27.990 --> 05:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative representative Marsh has
 
05:28:31.628 --> 05:28:31.638 align:start position:0%
his hand up representative Marsh
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
05:28:35.230 --> 05:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:28:36.910 --> 05:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
before I give you my question
 
05:28:39.070 --> 05:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards did ask me to say
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
that he his remarks said nothing about
 
05:28:42.990 --> 05:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
the free market I don't know whether
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's true or not I'd have to listen to
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
his tape uh but my question to you has
 
05:28:51.990 --> 05:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
to do with the charge to the uh sha ship
 
05:28:54.548 --> 05:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
Council um and you and I have discussed
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
on many occasions that there are issues
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the cost of healthc care uh in New
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in spef specifically the
 
05:29:02.948 --> 05:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
cost of healthcare to individuals which
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
was the subject of an earlier bill that
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
we heard today uh would you be
 
05:29:08.830 --> 05:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea of changing the
 
05:29:11.910 --> 05:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
charge to this Council to include
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost of Health Care and
 
05:29:16.150 --> 05:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage in New Hampshire as
 
05:29:18.190 --> 05:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and the fiscal
 
05:29:20.190 --> 05:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
stability and sustainability of the
 
05:29:21.788 --> 05:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
various entities that provide Healthcare
 
05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
in New
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um thank you for your question
 
05:29:27.788 --> 05:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
actually though we answer the first part
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
first it was not in at repres pres 's
 
05:29:33.390 --> 05:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
testimony it was in the statement of
 
05:29:36.190 --> 05:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
intent where he said allowing increased
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
competition to reduce health care costs
 
05:29:40.110 --> 05:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so I was not speaking
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
to what his testimony was but speaking
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
to what the bill said the first part of
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
mine was about his testimony where he
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
stated that this was mandating what the
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner had to do with response to
 
05:29:53.910 --> 05:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
your request about changing some of the
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
um um charges I think we certainly could
 
05:29:59.670 --> 05:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
look at those I think looking at our
 
05:30:02.350 --> 05:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
state and comparison to others may be a
 
05:30:03.708 --> 05:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
difficult one because I'm not sure how
 
05:30:06.190 --> 05:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
we can get the data well from some of
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
the other states in a comparative
 
05:30:10.830 --> 05:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
fashion but I would certainly not oppose
 
05:30:12.910 --> 05:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
that because I think again the goal of
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is decrease costs and improve
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
Healthcare co uh outcomes it's really
 
05:30:20.190 --> 05:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
the the triple aim that Don Berwick
 
05:30:23.230 --> 05:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
talks about uh for healthc care reform
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
we want to decrease cost but still
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
improv quality and so whatever we can do
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
to do that but you know that's that's
 
05:30:31.390 --> 05:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
that is certainly not this bill but it
 
05:30:33.070 --> 05:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
could certainly be a vehicle as we
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier thank
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
you I thank you any other questions of
 
05:30:38.400 --> 05:30:44.750 align:start position:0%
you I thank you any other questions of
Representative

05:30:44.750 --> 05:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.150 --> 05:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
kerk I have lost my sheet with those who
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
are not yet testified but signed
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
up aha
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
um nope those are all checked off I had
 
05:31:04.990 --> 05:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
a few others that have signed up
 
05:31:07.230 --> 05:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
recently and I'd like a little help in
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
knowing who they
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
are absolutely we have Joan ask ask Asim
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I pronounced that
 
05:31:18.830 --> 05:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
incorrectly yes thank you let's bring
 
05:31:18.840 --> 05:31:25.510 align:start position:0%
incorrectly yes thank you let's bring
her

05:31:25.510 --> 05:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:28.350 --> 05:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
forward Miss ask if you just um there
 
05:31:32.070 --> 05:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
you go okay um so my name is Joan ashim
 
05:31:34.670 --> 05:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm recently retired um I'm a nurse
 
05:31:36.310 --> 05:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
and I was the executive director of the
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public Health Association
 
05:31:40.830 --> 05:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
I'm representing that Association which
 
05:31:42.590 --> 05:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
is membership organization of public
 
05:31:45.430 --> 05:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
health professionals across the state um
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to the bill I want to
 
05:31:51.230 --> 05:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
point out that I was around years ago
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
when we developed our first state um
 
05:31:56.948 --> 05:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
plan in New Hampshire and I also was on
 
05:31:58.948 --> 05:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
the leadership team developing a similar
 
05:32:01.788 --> 05:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
plan in the state of con concut um and
 
05:32:03.948 --> 05:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
also I was a member of the public health
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
accreditation board which is a board
 
05:32:07.948 --> 05:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
that accredits state and local Health
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
departments and one of the major
 
05:32:12.628 --> 05:32:12.638 align:start position:0%
requirements for that accreditation is a
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
state health Improvement plan and State
 
05:32:17.070 --> 05:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
Health assessment this plan that's in
 
05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation follows the
 
05:32:21.548 --> 05:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations for best practices for
 
05:32:23.070 --> 05:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment and State Health
 
05:32:26.190 --> 05:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan further those the the
 
05:32:28.390 --> 05:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
accreditation standards and this
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislation call for reporting in on
 
05:32:32.350 --> 05:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes and accountability so there is
 
05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
that piece of it um I I I did want to
 
05:32:38.910 --> 05:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
say you know a couple of people have
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
asked about well what might we see come
 
05:32:43.510 --> 05:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
of this and I just thought I could give
 
05:32:45.628 --> 05:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
you a couple of concrete examples that
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
came out in Connecticut um one was a
 
05:32:51.750 --> 05:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
policy change and that was to have
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
standardized housing uh uh statutes
 
05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
across the state so that each each
 
05:32:59.400 --> 05:33:00.510 align:start position:0%
across the state so that each each
community

05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the same things when they
 
05:33:03.390 --> 05:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
looked at housing standards now you
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
might not think that would be in a
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
health Improvement plan but if you think
 
05:33:09.548 --> 05:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
about the ramifications of poor housing
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
asthma lead poisoning and and injuries
 
05:33:15.070 --> 05:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
so so that was a public health policy
 
05:33:17.310 --> 05:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
change that was recommended on the other
 
05:33:18.990 --> 05:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
hand there are programmatic changes that
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
might be recommended for example we know
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
that if women have babies too close
 
05:33:24.510 --> 05:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
together that it
 
05:33:27.310 --> 05:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
decreases it can um account for poor
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes for the baby so one of the
 
05:33:32.670 --> 05:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
other Pol uh program practices that was
 
05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
being undertaken is to talk to women
 
05:33:37.510 --> 05:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
when when they're not pregnant about
 
05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
when you know how do they want to have
 
05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
children how frequently do they want to
 
05:33:43.230 --> 05:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
have children so that's a change in
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
programming so I think that that these
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
changes can be made on a number of
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
different levels um that can change the
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
health of the population of the
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
state um I I wanted to reiterate what Dr
 
05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
Ramos said that only 80 only 20% of of
 
05:34:01.948 --> 05:34:01.958 align:start position:0%
our health is dependent on upon Health
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
Care the other 80 is based on the
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we have to eat
 
05:34:10.510 --> 05:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
healthy to exercise to abstain from
 
05:34:13.708 --> 05:34:13.718 align:start position:0%
smoking um and healthy behaviors and so
 
05:34:16.350 --> 05:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
this plan helps to focus on those root
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
causes and also allows for that
 
05:34:21.310 --> 05:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
integration for example of Housing and
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
health care to work together so that
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're not working in silos and they
 
05:34:28.750 --> 05:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
can you can change housing standards so
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
that you can have improved tell so I
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
will I submitted written testimony I
 
05:34:35.070 --> 05:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
just did want to speak to some of the
 
05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised and um to say
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that um we uh oppose and ask that you
 
05:34:45.150 --> 05:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
oppose this Bill thank you very much
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
witness representative gay thank you Mr
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
question how much does it cost per year
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
for this uh organization to
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
function for the council to
 
05:35:05.920 --> 05:35:08.070 align:start position:0%
function for the council to
function

05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
function
 
05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I mean there's no funding
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
allocated for the council to function
 
05:35:15.548 --> 05:35:15.558 align:start position:0%
people are doing it either on volunteer
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
time or as a part of their job so I mean
 
05:35:21.628 --> 05:35:21.638 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any additional
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
costs for the council itself
 
05:35:26.070 --> 05:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative KARK or Marsh you might
 
05:35:26.080 --> 05:35:28.190 align:start position:0%
representative KARK or Marsh you might
know

05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh
 
05:35:33.430 --> 05:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative kerk yes there was
 
05:35:35.948 --> 05:35:35.958 align:start position:0%
some money allocated in the original
 
05:35:39.030 --> 05:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill but I think that has to do with the
 
05:35:41.990 --> 05:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um State Health Improvement plan I don't
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
think it has to do with the advisory
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
Council I do not know that with
 
05:35:47.390 --> 05:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
certainty but for example I mean we are
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
there in an advisory fashion and I'm
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
assume there must be some contract
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
between DHHS and the Health Institute of
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
policy at New Hampshire at UNH because
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
they probably want to get paid for their
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
work but the rers are doing it for our
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
usual High wages that we get as
 
05:36:07.948 --> 05:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
representatives and um other volunteers
 
05:36:10.350 --> 05:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
for example Dr ramas Who testified
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
earlier she doesn't get paid anything
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
she just shows up and does her work like
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:26.310 --> 05:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
snow representative snow you had your
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
hand up need to un you gotta un me there
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
you are there you
 
05:36:38.670 --> 05:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
go um I'm a little fuzzy on details
 
05:36:41.310 --> 05:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
about this but when I first came to the
 
05:36:41.320 --> 05:36:42.590 align:start position:0%
about this but when I first came to the
house

05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
I uh four or five years ago uh there was
 
05:36:49.628 --> 05:36:49.638 align:start position:0%
a plan of foot based on some planning
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
efforts that were going on under the
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
former commissioner before Lori shabet
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
took over and that plan included
 
05:37:00.750 --> 05:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
changing the districts the Mental Health
 
05:37:04.510 --> 05:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
Centers uh community health centers uh
 
05:37:08.350 --> 05:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
Behavior Uh uh developmental disability
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
centers and so forth all have different
 
05:37:13.150 --> 05:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
regions that they serve and his plan was
 
05:37:16.430 --> 05:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
to take the state most of whom had even
 
05:37:19.150 --> 05:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
10 or 11 districts combined them into
 
05:37:21.390 --> 05:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
just seven districts and they were doing
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
some planning within all seven of those
 
05:37:26.270 --> 05:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
districts and it's still ongoing uh
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
there's directors and planning staff
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
that are working and all those areas and
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
yet we've heard very little about how
 
05:37:34.990 --> 05:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
much progress was made how that fits
 
05:37:36.750 --> 05:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
into this plan and it might be
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
worthwhile getting a report from them is
 
05:37:40.910 --> 05:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
this still a reality is this still
 
05:37:43.070 --> 05:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
something going on about dividing that
 
05:37:45.230 --> 05:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
up it might help us in our thinking
 
05:37:45.240 --> 05:37:48.548 align:start position:0%
up it might help us in our thinking
thank

05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
you I don't know if that question was
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
for me but if if Lisa Morris is on I
 
05:37:57.190 --> 05:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
think she could answer that better than
 
05:38:11.548 --> 05:38:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes yes great hello
 
05:38:17.470 --> 05:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
again everybody
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
um so uh thank you uh representative
 
05:38:25.150 --> 05:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
snow for your question um prior to so
 
05:38:27.070 --> 05:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
you're right there were although I was
 
05:38:29.910 --> 05:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the community at the time there were
 
05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh discussions on the state level uh and
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
even when I came into the state four
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
years ago relative to regionalization
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
and what that should look like and then
 
05:38:43.628 --> 05:38:43.638 align:start position:0%
of course covid hit and um we although
 
05:38:45.590 --> 05:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of other work other than
 
05:38:48.750 --> 05:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
co co has really um delayed that
 
05:38:48.760 --> 05:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
co co has really um delayed that
continued

05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
continued
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
conversation um but we will have it um
 
05:38:56.430 --> 05:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
will this particular plan um discuss
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
that I I I really I don't know uh
 
05:39:02.350 --> 05:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh because we're just not there yet um
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
it could possibly make some
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations related to it uh but uh
 
05:39:08.830 --> 05:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's too early to
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
tell thank
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%

05:40:31.548 --> 05:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
we are an aging State and an aging
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
nation and an aging world if we are
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
Adept at adapting to this demographic
 
05:40:39.070 --> 05:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
shift we can support well-being later in
 
05:40:41.230 --> 05:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
life so that more of us are able to
 
05:40:42.788 --> 05:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
continue to contribute to our families
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
and communities over the Long Haul there
 
05:40:47.350 --> 05:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
is a longevity dividend to be realized
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
in this longevity era both economically
 
05:40:52.350 --> 05:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
and socially thoughtful assessments and
 
05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
planning at the local Regional and state
 
05:40:56.110 --> 05:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
level will enable communities in the
 
05:40:58.548 --> 05:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
state to engage in coherent consistent
 
05:41:00.910 --> 05:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
action and leverage more resources to
 
05:41:02.430 --> 05:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
address the conditions to create the
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for health and
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
well-being coordination at these various
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
levels of governance and community
 
05:41:10.270 --> 05:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
structure results in Greater planning
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
efficiency and better outcomes we do not
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
believe this process to be reiterative
 
05:41:16.628 --> 05:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
of the community health needs assessment
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
required by Community Hospitals it
 
05:41:20.788 --> 05:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
should build upon those assessments to
 
05:41:22.628 --> 05:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
create greater value for all communities
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we also find the
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
process not at all alike the bygone
 
05:41:29.310 --> 05:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
certificate of need process as the the
 
05:41:30.910 --> 05:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment and State Health
 
05:41:32.590 --> 05:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans are advisory rather
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
than regulatory as has been mentioned in
 
05:41:38.750 --> 05:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
the past and um really a state health
 
05:41:40.430 --> 05:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan is a rallying vehicle
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
to focus resources efficiently
 
05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
around the comprehensive nature of the
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
assessment and plan go far beyond
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care infrastructure that was
 
05:41:50.948 --> 05:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
managed with the certificate need
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
process the determinance of Health are
 
05:41:56.750 --> 05:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
much broader um than the healthc care
 
05:41:58.750 --> 05:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
that is available in our communities the
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
planning process as outline seeks to
 
05:42:03.150 --> 05:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
address all that drives Health possibly
 
05:42:05.350 --> 05:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
including housing Transportation social
 
05:42:08.310 --> 05:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
isolation all issues that that matter to
 
05:42:09.628 --> 05:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
all of us as we
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
age I also heard concerned that last
 
05:42:13.628 --> 05:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
year statute creates an administrative
 
05:42:16.030 --> 05:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
burden uh limiting possibilities to the
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
strategic planning by DHHS in contrast I
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
suggest that the broad template in the
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
RSA allows DHHS to jump past rudimentary
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
process decisions to quickly get at the
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
important meat of strategic
 
05:42:30.750 --> 05:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
planning um as mentioned previously the
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
Shaw and the ship process have has
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
happened in the past another advantage
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
of codifying this process in state law
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
that makes the process it is that it
 
05:42:40.708 --> 05:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
makes the process more open to the
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
public with greater
 
05:42:44.230 --> 05:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
transparency just the posting of the
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
council meetings on the Gen Court
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
calendar increases Public Access and
 
05:42:49.948 --> 05:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
some the state Commission on Aging
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
believes there's Great Value to the
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment and State Health
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
Improvement planning process we are
 
05:42:56.670 --> 05:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
excited by the fourth thought that
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
included the chair of the state
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging um and
 
05:43:01.390 --> 05:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative from the New Hampshire
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
Alliance for healthy aging on the
 
05:43:06.190 --> 05:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
advisory Council the years of infirmity
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
and of infirmity at the end of life can
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
be minimized by planned action to
 
05:43:13.030 --> 05:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
address the determinance of Health and
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
Wellness based in our communities
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
greater alignment between local Regional
 
05:43:19.788 --> 05:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
State Health Improvement plans will
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
result in a better New Hampshire and a
 
05:43:24.670 --> 05:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
transparent process overseen by the
 
05:43:27.190 --> 05:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislature made with deep engagement of
 
05:43:29.310 --> 05:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
the incredibly diverse advisory Council
 
05:43:32.190 --> 05:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
will ensure a good product thank you so
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
much would you take some questions
 
05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.110 --> 05:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none the chair
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
minahan I can't make it just yet no I
 
05:44:24.628 --> 05:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
M Manan we can't hear you if you're
 
05:44:30.430 --> 05:44:30.440 align:start position:0%

that uh we've got Miss minahan on and
 
05:44:35.230 --> 05:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
she's unmuted however we're not able to
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
hear her speak okay is there anyone else

05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
yet I believe representative mapi has
 
05:45:00.390 --> 05:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
her hand raised in the
 
05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
attendees has asked to
 
05:45:05.548 --> 05:45:05.558 align:start position:0%
testify uh she has her hand raised after
 
05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
your question so I agree I think so
 
05:45:08.558 --> 05:45:09.510 align:start position:0%
your question so I agree I think so
understand

05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:45:15.150 --> 05:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:19.628 --> 05:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
please um good afternoon chairman and
 
05:45:22.150 --> 05:45:22.160 align:start position:0%

signed up in support of this and I had
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak in the previous uh
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
yoga the author
 
05:45:30.910 --> 05:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
therapy Bill
 
05:45:33.948 --> 05:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
247 but it feels like listening to all
 
05:45:33.958 --> 05:45:34.868 align:start position:0%
247 but it feels like listening to all
that

05:45:34.868 --> 05:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:38.430 --> 05:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
discussion seems like this is a very
 
05:45:41.548 --> 05:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
worthy Council that's looking at
 
05:45:45.110 --> 05:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
changing the course of or benefiting our
 
05:45:48.468 --> 05:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
Granite status for health outcomes and
 
05:45:50.990 --> 05:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the council that can look
 
05:45:54.350 --> 05:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
at innovative ways of um
 
05:45:57.390 --> 05:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
providing uh Wellness Health and
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
prevention and early prevention programs
 
05:46:03.868 --> 05:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
in health care field and uh so I'm
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
thinking here saying oh this is where
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
the alternative therapies and
 
05:46:12.910 --> 05:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
interventions should be looked at and
 
05:46:15.310 --> 05:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
see how the efficacy and changing the
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
outcome of the health and well-being uh
 
05:46:22.830 --> 05:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
would help the granite status that's all
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
05:46:27.150 --> 05:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone
 
05:46:30.910 --> 05:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
else uh Mr chair chairman yes sir I I
 
05:46:32.270 --> 05:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
would like to point out that there were
 
05:46:35.310 --> 05:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
two PA minahan listed under attendees
 
05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
and I think it's possible that Christina
 
05:46:39.788 --> 05:46:39.798 align:start position:0%
promoted the wrong one so I would ask
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:46:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
one

05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:47:03.868 --> 05:47:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
are uh there's another one in the
 
05:47:08.750 --> 05:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
attendees Christina and still listed in
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
the attendees with a hand
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%

up that's the one that I uh Pro um that
I

05:47:20.590 --> 05:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:27.718 --> 05:47:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
trying

05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
trying
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
if there is no one else signed up to
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%

157 and I open the hearing on House Bill
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
244 relative to the membership and
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%

duties of the joint healthc care reform
oversight

05:47:48.510 --> 05:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
05:47:56.590 --> 05:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%

05:59:04.510 --> 05:59:04.520 align:start position:0%

05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
did when she testified before and she
 
05:59:07.868 --> 05:59:07.878 align:start position:0%

05:59:11.350 --> 05:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
work thank you such as the strangeness
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:59:19.990 --> 05:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 244 relative to
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%

Healthcare reform oversight committee
 
05:59:27.830 --> 05:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson Prime sponsor
 
05:59:30.310 --> 05:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson you are
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:38.510 --> 05:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
speak can you folks hear me yes we
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
can uh all right uh my name is
 
05:59:42.468 --> 05:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
representative Max Abramson I'm
 
05:59:44.628 --> 05:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
representing uh the beautiful towns of
 
05:59:47.390 --> 05:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampton Hampton Falls and Seabrook um I
 
05:59:49.750 --> 05:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
did introduce House Bill
 
05:59:53.628 --> 05:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
244 um the effect of the bill is simply
 
05:59:55.590 --> 05:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
that we take all of these Healthcare or
 
05:59:57.270 --> 05:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
all these not Healthcare bills all these
 
05:59:59.708 --> 05:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
health ideas that we come up with that
 
06:00:02.708 --> 06:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
people come up with and uh simply allow
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
the joint Healthcare reform oversight
 
06:00:08.150 --> 06:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee to take on those ideas uh so
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
when we have a bill like uh House Bill
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
157 um it certainly has a lot of good
 
06:00:19.390 --> 06:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
ideas in it but there are um roughly 15%
 
06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
of our
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
bills um and probably as many ideas that
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
members have relate to healthcare it
 
06:00:29.070 --> 06:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
would be uh much more more time
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
effective if we asked members to go
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
through the joint Healthcare reform
 
06:00:35.948 --> 06:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
oversight committee right now it means
 
06:00:38.788 --> 06:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
regularly um it has a limited role this
 
06:00:41.628 --> 06:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
bill would expand the membership by five
 
06:00:44.788 --> 06:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the governor but um
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
some members of the House indicated that
 
06:00:49.270 --> 06:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
they'd like uh maybe the speaker or the
 
06:00:51.030 --> 06:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
chairman of Health and Human Services or
 
06:00:53.590 --> 06:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce or or uh someone else to make
 
06:00:57.788 --> 06:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
these appointments um the intent is when
 
06:01:00.350 --> 06:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
members have ideas for getting cost down
 
06:01:00.360 --> 06:01:02.110 align:start position:0%
members have ideas for getting cost down
or

06:01:02.110 --> 06:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
removing other boards and committees
 
06:01:08.190 --> 06:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
that they feel are uh no longer relevant
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
or if someone has an idea in General on
 
06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
Healthcare that they they simply sit
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
down with this board and have a kind of
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
informal discussion there um I've had
 
06:01:19.670 --> 06:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
quite a few ideas over the years I I did
 
06:01:22.030 --> 06:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh take the ideas from the New Hampshire
 
06:01:24.830 --> 06:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
Republican platform which have again a
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
lot of ideas that do translate into
 
06:01:26.638 --> 06:01:27.948 align:start position:0%
lot of ideas that do translate into
legislation

06:01:27.948 --> 06:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:01:29.070 --> 06:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the list of
 
06:01:32.110 --> 06:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
legislative service requests and do a
 
06:01:35.390 --> 06:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
quick search the word uh medical appears
 
06:01:38.868 --> 06:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
16 times the word Health appears 47
 
06:01:41.868 --> 06:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
times um again more than 15% of the
 
06:01:44.590 --> 06:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
bills coming through deal just with
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
health care direct primary care
 
06:01:48.750 --> 06:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
physicians health savings accounts and
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
and and so forth and some of them are
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
good ideas and are worthy of legislation
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
but need a little more time than than
 
06:01:58.110 --> 06:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
just two members kind of talking about
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
an idea and then putting in a bill um
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
each one of these bills can have two
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
three and four hour hearings um and
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
that's not the most
 
06:02:09.990 --> 06:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
efficient process for doing it that that
 
06:02:11.948 --> 06:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
does consume a lot of our time I'm on
 
06:02:13.868 --> 06:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
Commerce we get about uh one healthc
 
06:02:15.548 --> 06:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
care or one insurance or an insurance
 
06:02:17.708 --> 06:02:17.718 align:start position:0%
mandate Bill something related to that
 
06:02:20.430 --> 06:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
per day um I was on Municipal and County
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
before that and we got a few healthcare
 
06:02:24.910 --> 06:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
related bills almost all the Committees
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
get a few health and uh medical
 
06:02:30.390 --> 06:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
insurance related bills so um and it
 
06:02:33.150 --> 06:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
does consume a lot of time on the floor
 
06:02:36.270 --> 06:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
so my preference is to Simply take ask
 
06:02:38.750 --> 06:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
members to take their ideas to the Joint
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
Healthcare reform oversight committee
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
which is an already existing committee
 
06:02:44.590 --> 06:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
does move the report date up from
 
06:02:48.430 --> 06:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
December 1st to October 1st every year
 
06:02:50.430 --> 06:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh and the intent of that is if somebody
 
06:02:52.628 --> 06:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
actually does have an idea for a bill
 
06:02:55.548 --> 06:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
we've kind of heard the pros and cons um
 
06:02:56.948 --> 06:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
they can decide whether or not uh
 
06:02:58.670 --> 06:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's any value or Merit in it but
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
they can also make the uh amendments and
 
06:03:04.910 --> 06:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh changes to language before they
 
06:03:07.708 --> 06:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
come before uh one of our
 
06:03:11.830 --> 06:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
committees um and of course when we have
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
experts come in and speak on these bills
 
06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
um they deal with the the the draft
 
06:03:18.510 --> 06:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
version of the bill not the amended
 
06:03:20.230 --> 06:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
version um and some committee chairs
 
06:03:21.510 --> 06:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't even allow amendments to be
 
06:03:23.510 --> 06:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussed during the hearing uh what we
 
06:03:25.150 --> 06:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
need is the kind of the final version of
 
06:03:26.628 --> 06:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of us so we can see
 
06:03:28.110 --> 06:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
the actual language a lot of members of
 
06:03:29.230 --> 06:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
the House have stated that they would
 
06:03:33.270 --> 06:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
much rather get the final language um
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
the the U someone from The Nurses
 
06:03:38.990 --> 06:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
Association contacted me and suggested
 
06:03:41.390 --> 06:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
that we specify a nurse and I said well
 
06:03:43.948 --> 06:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
maybe we need two nurses on this um
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
board but we need people who have
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
experience in healthc care to just kind
 
06:03:51.708 --> 06:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
of have a sitdown informal talk on ways
 
06:03:53.468 --> 06:03:53.478 align:start position:0%
to get health care costs down and get
 
06:03:55.590 --> 06:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
service up we spend about 24% of our
 
06:03:58.190 --> 06:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
health care costs are spent just on
 
06:04:00.310 --> 06:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
Administration um we spend about $60
 
06:04:02.030 --> 06:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
billion a year just on defensive
 
06:04:04.030 --> 06:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
medicine we spend about $90 billion a
 
06:04:05.548 --> 06:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
year on pharmaceutical
 
06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
advertising um we
 
06:04:10.590 --> 06:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
spend um you know something like $500
 
06:04:12.430 --> 06:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
billion doar a year is just spent on
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
overcharging of services so there's
 
06:04:16.350 --> 06:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways to reduce costs
 
06:04:19.628 --> 06:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of ways to to uh to
 
06:04:22.548 --> 06:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
improve service but it's it it it's
 
06:04:24.110 --> 06:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
better to take those ideas and have a
 
06:04:25.868 --> 06:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
little back and forth and draw on some
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
of the senior members
 
06:04:31.230 --> 06:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
of the House and Senate who have some
 
06:04:33.390 --> 06:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
experience um dealing with healthcare
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
related bills so that's the intent I of
 
06:04:39.628 --> 06:04:39.638 align:start position:0%
course open to Amendment um and the
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
Bill's house
 
06:04:45.070 --> 06:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
244 um and it just uh it it expands the
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
duties of that existing oversight
 
06:04:51.468 --> 06:04:51.478 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative will
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:56.080 --> 06:05:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
thing

06:05:01.070 --> 06:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay who's
 
06:05:05.830 --> 06:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
first representative Shapiro and kerk
 
06:05:09.628 --> 06:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
have their hands up representative
 
06:05:12.628 --> 06:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking this
 
06:05:18.350 --> 06:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
question in your presentation I heard
 
06:05:21.948 --> 06:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
you talk about um consolidating
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussions about healthc care all
 
06:05:27.070 --> 06:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
within this um within this Comm
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee and um but you did not
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
address the
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
specific um agenda for things to be
 
06:05:40.270 --> 06:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
studied by this committee so on line 21
 
06:05:42.910 --> 06:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
page one line
 
06:05:45.910 --> 06:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
21 you say
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
that one of the explicit areas for study
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
will be recommending that Congress
 
06:05:54.708 --> 06:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
repeal the federal patient protection
 
06:05:58.750 --> 06:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act um um known as the
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act um I guess um I know
 
06:06:05.150 --> 06:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
that you're saying that this group would
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
only study this issue but clearly among
 
06:06:10.990 --> 06:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
the things to be studied there seems to
 
06:06:13.390 --> 06:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
be a um an
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
agenda and I would ask you why you would
 
06:06:19.430 --> 06:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
want a committee to explicitly be
 
06:06:21.590 --> 06:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
studying doing away with the Affordable
 
06:06:25.910 --> 06:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
Care Act when um between the marketplace
 
06:06:27.830 --> 06:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
and expanded Med medicate there are
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
approximately 100,000 New Hampshire
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
residents who are currently insured
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
through the Affordable Care Act who
 
06:06:36.270 --> 06:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
would then be without
 
06:06:36.280 --> 06:06:37.830 align:start position:0%
would then be without
insurance

06:06:37.830 --> 06:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
um especially bad during covid but
 
06:06:43.510 --> 06:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
really plenty bad anytime so I'm
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
wondering why this is part of your
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill so the bill uh doesn't consolidate
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
discussion essentially if you were to
 
06:06:56.750 --> 06:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
bring that remark that you brought up to
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
this committee or if you were even
 
06:07:00.468 --> 06:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
serving on that the oversight committee
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
at the time the chairman would rule you
 
06:07:04.670 --> 06:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
out of order and you wouldn't be able to
 
06:07:06.788 --> 06:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
to discuss that remark you wouldn't be
 
06:07:09.510 --> 06:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
able to speak for or against or uh
 
06:07:12.110 --> 06:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
discuss uh let's say some of the we had
 
06:07:14.310 --> 06:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
what five or six proposed amendments to
 
06:07:17.150 --> 06:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid expansion Bill he wouldn't
 
06:07:20.390 --> 06:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
be able to discuss any of those so uh I
 
06:07:21.788 --> 06:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
am certainly aware that there are a lot
 
06:07:23.868 --> 06:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
of study committees before the house
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
that are actually advocating for some
 
06:07:29.310 --> 06:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
kind of agenda this is simply saying
 
06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
that the chair wouldn't rule someone out
 
06:07:33.310 --> 06:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
of order that uh if you were sitting
 
06:07:35.430 --> 06:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
before this committee or sitting around
 
06:07:36.910 --> 06:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
the table you would not you would not be
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
ruled out of order you'd be able to
 
06:07:39.750 --> 06:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
discuss the pros and
 
06:07:44.590 --> 06:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
cons uh of that idea admittedly these um
 
06:07:47.628 --> 06:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
10 points are essentially copy pasted
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
right out of the New Hampshire
 
06:07:51.190 --> 06:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
Republican platform because these
 
06:07:55.590 --> 06:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
specific ideas are discussed all the
 
06:07:57.510 --> 06:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
time that we hear about them often
 
06:07:59.590 --> 06:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
enough for delegates to introduce these
 
06:08:01.628 --> 06:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
ideas and for members of the house to
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
introduce these ideas for consideration
 
06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
because they get talked about all the
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
time and the place for the for the idea
 
06:08:10.990 --> 06:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
um certainly the idea of repealing
 
06:08:13.830 --> 06:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
Obamacare earning a part of Obamacare um
 
06:08:15.948 --> 06:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
does get discussed a lot in the actual
 
06:08:17.628 --> 06:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
details if somebody wanted to draft a
 
06:08:17.638 --> 06:08:18.708 align:start position:0%
details if somebody wanted to draft a
house

06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:08:21.430 --> 06:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
resolution um or simply you might
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
encourage them to Simply write a letter
 
06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
to their member of Congress as a
 
06:08:27.150 --> 06:08:27.160 align:start position:0%
legislator and ask them or even form an
 
06:08:29.030 --> 06:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee or something based on
 
06:08:32.510 --> 06:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
your experience um but essentially what
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to say here's
 
06:08:36.910 --> 06:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
we have the joint Healthcare reform task
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
force we're expanding what you're
 
06:08:40.910 --> 06:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to discuss while you're sitting
 
06:08:44.270 --> 06:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
in with this uh committee um anything
 
06:08:46.390 --> 06:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
related to healthcare you'd be open to
 
06:08:46.400 --> 06:08:52.468 align:start position:0%
related to healthcare you'd be open to
talk

06:08:52.468 --> 06:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
about any further questions for the
 
06:08:55.718 --> 06:08:57.990 align:start position:0%
about any further questions for the
representative

06:08:57.990 --> 06:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:59.708 --> 06:08:59.718 align:start position:0%
representative kerk and representative
 
06:09:01.150 --> 06:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant have their hands up
 
06:09:01.160 --> 06:09:02.990 align:start position:0%
Merchant have their hands up
representative

06:09:02.990 --> 06:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
kerk uh thank you uh thank you
 
06:09:07.830 --> 06:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative a for taking my question
 
06:09:10.110 --> 06:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
I was a little curious about your data
 
06:09:12.510 --> 06:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
sources and you've sort of alluded to
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
this in uh line 28 in the first page
 
06:09:18.548 --> 06:09:18.558 align:start position:0%
where you again are talking about what
 
06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
things could be studied increasing the
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
use of Market forces to improve health
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
care and lower costs and I was curious
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
other than a platform of a party what
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
your data source is for making that
 
06:09:32.590 --> 06:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
assertion given the fact that we have an
 
06:09:34.990 --> 06:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
abundance of data the demonstrates the
 
06:09:36.750 --> 06:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
United States has the most free market
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
competitive Health Care system with the
 
06:09:42.150 --> 06:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
highest costs and the worst outcomes
 
06:09:45.070 --> 06:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
that study has really already been done
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
and so I'm curious what your data source
 
06:09:49.548 --> 06:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
is for making that assertion that uh
 
06:09:52.030 --> 06:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
free market would decrease cost and
 
06:09:52.040 --> 06:09:52.990 align:start position:0%
free market would decrease cost and
increase

06:09:52.990 --> 06:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:09:55.230 --> 06:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
quality uh you wouldn't be allowed to
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
discuss that on on this task force as it
 
06:10:00.270 --> 06:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm trying to pass the bill to
 
06:10:05.350 --> 06:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
allow you to say that however um I spoke
 
06:10:06.948 --> 06:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
with my grandmother and I spoke with
 
06:10:08.590 --> 06:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
some older folks about how health care
 
06:10:11.868 --> 06:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
used to be back in the day um Health
 
06:10:15.270 --> 06:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
Care today is in the United States the
 
06:10:16.990 --> 06:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
US healthc care system is the most
 
06:10:19.310 --> 06:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
regulated industry in the world it's the
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
most licensed industry in the world it's
 
06:10:23.230 --> 06:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
the most litigated industry in the world
 
06:10:25.390 --> 06:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
it is by far the most subsidized
 
06:10:27.948 --> 06:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
industry in the world uh and so on and
 
06:10:31.070 --> 06:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
so on and the most mandates uh we have
 
06:10:34.468 --> 06:10:34.478 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 17 and 57 Insurance
 
06:10:36.030 --> 06:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
mandates per state ever since the
 
06:10:39.948 --> 06:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
McCaron Ferguson ACT first States um in
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
19 McCaron Ferguson Act of 1945 and then
 
06:10:46.468 --> 06:10:46.478 align:start position:0%
uh the federal government in the mid
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
1960s began heavily stepping up
 
06:10:52.030 --> 06:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
regulations and and subsidies and and
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
and programs and so forth so we've gone
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
from what I would consider a free market
 
06:11:00.190 --> 06:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
healthare system in the 1950s and early
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
60s which cost about 5% of GDP to a a
 
06:11:07.350 --> 06:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
system where you've got a 10 to 18e
 
06:11:09.670 --> 06:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
approval process by the FDA you've got
 
06:11:12.150 --> 06:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
of course the Obamacare mandates I think
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
was split into two different viewed as
 
06:11:15.868 --> 06:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
two different pieces of legislation by
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court you've had and that
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
was a 1300 page Bill you've had um
 
06:11:23.628 --> 06:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
countless other government intrusions of
 
06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
course there's patent abuse which is a
 
06:11:28.430 --> 06:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
federal issue um um and and so on and so
 
06:11:29.830 --> 06:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
on and so on there's so much
 
06:11:31.628 --> 06:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
protectionism in the Health Care system
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
that blocks competition and we have you
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
know a lot of bills coming through that
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
are designed to open up Health Care to
 
06:11:42.750 --> 06:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
more choices and more competition not
 
06:11:45.430 --> 06:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
just to get cost down as explicitly
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
stated in the bill but also to get
 
06:11:50.350 --> 06:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
quality up um when I talk to people
 
06:11:51.788 --> 06:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of the things they're
 
06:11:54.390 --> 06:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
talking about um with Healthcare are
 
06:11:55.948 --> 06:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
getting cost down and then about
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
onethird of were talking about the
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
quality of the customer service and uh
 
06:12:02.270 --> 06:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
if you've dealt with Comcast Comcast
 
06:12:04.110 --> 06:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
kind of has a monopoly where I live and
 
06:12:06.830 --> 06:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
they get to charge whatever they want
 
06:12:09.510 --> 06:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
and whatever customer service you get
 
06:12:11.468 --> 06:12:11.478 align:start position:0%
that's the customer service you get if
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
you remember the old days with AT&amp;T it
 
06:12:14.590 --> 06:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
had no
 
06:12:16.990 --> 06:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
competition um if you didn't like the
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
customer service that you got or the
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
prices you were paying there was nowhere
 
06:12:21.230 --> 06:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
else you could go because there wasn't
 
06:12:23.628 --> 06:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
any competition back then representative
 
06:12:27.390 --> 06:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
a uh Abramson uh we are starting to move
 
06:12:30.830 --> 06:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
off the specific Bill itself so I'm
 
06:12:34.990 --> 06:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to um suggest I have a followup
 
06:12:37.708 --> 06:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
yes representative kerk yes but just
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
very quickly well you've been comparing
 
06:12:41.310 --> 06:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
how the United States is now to what it
 
06:12:42.990 --> 06:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
was maybe 50 years ago a few other
 
06:12:44.910 --> 06:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
things have changed my question is have
 
06:12:46.990 --> 06:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
you looked at the international data
 
06:12:48.430 --> 06:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
that compares different Health Care
 
06:12:51.030 --> 06:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
Systems and costs and outcomes because I
 
06:12:53.468 --> 06:12:53.478 align:start position:0%
think that's more illustrative thank you
 
06:12:57.910 --> 06:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh yes I've spent uh um quite a
 
06:13:00.468 --> 06:13:00.478 align:start position:0%
few years on that Germany Japan
 
06:13:03.390 --> 06:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
Singapore Hong Kong Switzerland all have
 
06:13:04.868 --> 06:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
basically free market Health Care
 
06:13:08.230 --> 06:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
Systems Germany has the bismar system um
 
06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
they have private insurance with a lot
 
06:13:11.910 --> 06:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
of competition in their in their
 
06:13:14.708 --> 06:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
insurance market and those are all you
 
06:13:15.990 --> 06:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
know the health savings accounts in
 
06:13:18.868 --> 06:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
Singapore the public option in Singapore
 
06:13:20.548 --> 06:13:20.558 align:start position:0%
um nearly all of those countries are
 
06:13:22.430 --> 06:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
based primarily on private not just
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
private insurance but have far less
 
06:13:25.788 --> 06:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
government involvement in their
 
06:13:28.030 --> 06:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
Healthcare System system and those are
 
06:13:30.390 --> 06:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
things that that are definitely should
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
be open game for an open discussion
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
rather than somebody just you know kind
 
06:13:36.468 --> 06:13:36.478 align:start position:0%
of drafting a bill and putting it in and
 
06:13:40.150 --> 06:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce I have down uh representative
 
06:13:46.830 --> 06:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant to to ask a
 
06:13:50.310 --> 06:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:13:52.110 --> 06:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
06:13:54.390 --> 06:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative we just discussed for
 
06:13:58.190 --> 06:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
quite a length time a bill
 
06:14:00.948 --> 06:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
157 which was the State Health
 
06:14:02.590 --> 06:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
Council and would that be a better place
 
06:14:07.788 --> 06:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
to place some of these things we talked
 
06:14:10.270 --> 06:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
about modifying it to include health
 
06:14:11.590 --> 06:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
care costs I think which is what you're
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
trying to drive at um would you be
 
06:14:18.030 --> 06:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
amendable to modifying this to either
 
06:14:22.230 --> 06:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
include it in Bill 157 or to uh somehow
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
bring it together I'm just concerned we
 
06:14:27.030 --> 06:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
have multiple councils doing multiple
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
things but all trying to get to the same
 
06:14:31.150 --> 06:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
point would you be amendable to amending

uh fastest growing aging populations in

the country I think that the covid
 
06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
pandemic has just made uh even clearer
 
06:17:51.590 --> 06:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
the need for us to have in place
 
06:17:53.590 --> 06:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to protect the most
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
vulnerable members of our society and
 
06:17:59.590 --> 06:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's what um this legislation before

anything to do with Firearms I mean for
 
06:20:26.868 --> 06:20:26.878 align:start position:0%

06:20:30.590 --> 06:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh into a bill that was model Upon Our
 
06:20:34.548 --> 06:20:34.558 align:start position:0%

I haven't found
 
06:21:11.150 --> 06:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:15.788 --> 06:21:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:22.990 --> 06:21:23.000 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing for taking my
 
06:21:38.948 --> 06:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
question which is exactly the same
 
06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
question that uh uh representative kerk
 
06:21:44.468 --> 06:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
just asked because I read it very
 
06:21:46.070 --> 06:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
thoroughly and could find absolutely no
 
06:21:49.230 --> 06:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
reference to Firearms or confiscation
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I was reluctant to respond to
 
06:21:54.350 --> 06:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
anybody until we had a a question but
 
06:21:55.868 --> 06:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not going to respond to
 
06:21:58.948 --> 06:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
157 I think it was emails that I got I
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how many others got but
 
06:22:04.190 --> 06:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
anyway question time testifying will
 
06:22:08.030 --> 06:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
come at a later time if you have a
 
06:22:11.430 --> 06:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
question you have a question yeah the
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
the yes thank
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
you I I I defer because I he I the
 
06:22:19.270 --> 06:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask is the same
 
06:22:21.990 --> 06:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
thing that representative kerk just
 
06:22:27.750 --> 06:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:30.750 --> 06:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
pero I will withdraw my question because
 
06:22:32.990 --> 06:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
it was the same as representative ker
 
06:22:36.628 --> 06:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
and representative snow so we've done
 
06:22:36.638 --> 06:22:39.070 align:start position:0%
and representative snow so we've done

about that um what I'm the area that I'm
 
06:23:37.990 --> 06:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
talking about is um on page five it's
 
06:23:39.910 --> 06:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
the area where they start listing the
 
06:23:44.670 --> 06:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
restraining portions of the bill um and
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about uh the places that are
 
06:23:52.310 --> 06:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
frequently uh
 
06:23:54.230 --> 06:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
06:23:59.548 --> 06:23:59.558 align:start position:0%
where the the um abused person the the
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adult May frequently U be
 
06:24:08.510 --> 06:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the plaintiff may not be there um I
 
06:24:10.670 --> 06:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
brought up as as I was looking at this I
 
06:24:12.110 --> 06:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
thought you know we all live in some
 
06:24:13.350 --> 06:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
pretty small
 
06:24:16.510 --> 06:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
towns uh where we shop there's only one
 
06:24:20.150 --> 06:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
store and there's only one gas station
 
06:24:24.830 --> 06:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
and um the the parents might have if
 
06:24:26.468 --> 06:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
it's a husband and wife the parents
 
06:24:27.868 --> 06:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
might have somebody at the school and
 
06:24:32.868 --> 06:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
they take turns picking them up is there
 
06:24:34.868 --> 06:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
how do how do you get around those kinds
 
06:24:37.310 --> 06:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
of situations where there's really not
 
06:24:39.190 --> 06:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
an option to be somewhere else that
 
06:24:41.948 --> 06:24:41.958 align:start position:0%
they're not there to abuse the person
 
06:24:43.350 --> 06:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
they're there because it's the only
 
06:24:45.590 --> 06:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
place they can go to get the things that
 
06:24:48.390 --> 06:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
they need or to
 
06:24:50.670 --> 06:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
um have a meeting with the school
 
06:24:52.390 --> 06:24:52.400 align:start position:0%

is such a big problem I'm also here um
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
just you know representing the New

06:26:55.270 --> 06:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
well-being of older Granite Staters and
 
06:26:58.590 --> 06:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
I am here today to support House Bill
 
06:27:02.070 --> 06:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
246 um as representative kushin pointed
 
06:27:04.510 --> 06:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
out um this has been kind of a long road
 
06:27:06.708 --> 06:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
on this bill it's I think this is the
 
06:27:09.628 --> 06:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
fourth time I've testified before this
 
06:27:12.990 --> 06:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
committee on it uh it had become has
 
06:27:16.030 --> 06:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately become very controversial
 
06:27:18.510 --> 06:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
um the first draft of the bill did
 
06:27:21.070 --> 06:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
include a provision to confiscate
 
06:27:24.230 --> 06:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
Firearms which was um directly taken
 
06:27:26.910 --> 06:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
from already already existing law that
 
06:27:28.708 --> 06:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence victims and
 
06:27:31.468 --> 06:27:31.478 align:start position:0%
stalking victims so the idea was is that
 
06:27:33.430 --> 06:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adults should have the same
 
06:27:37.110 --> 06:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
protections as those types of victims um
 
06:27:40.468 --> 06:27:40.478 align:start position:0%
because it became so controversial and
 
06:27:42.350 --> 06:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
there was so much opposition to having
 
06:27:46.510 --> 06:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
firearms in the bill at all every um
 
06:27:49.270 --> 06:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
reference to firearms and deadly weapons
 
06:27:51.548 --> 06:27:51.558 align:start position:0%
or anything remotely like that have been
 
06:27:54.750 --> 06:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
totally removed from the bill um and so
 
06:27:55.750 --> 06:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
there is
 
06:27:58.070 --> 06:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing as was asked before
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill that talks about
 
06:28:03.190 --> 06:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
confiscating firearms and you know it
 
06:28:05.510 --> 06:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
should be noted that the the um the
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
draft that's that you're looking at
 
06:28:08.910 --> 06:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
right now last year was a draft that was
 
06:28:12.110 --> 06:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
also uh introduced by uh Senator Bradley
 
06:28:14.190 --> 06:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
in the Senate because it was an agree to
 
06:28:16.030 --> 06:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
version that we had thought we had
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
consensus on but um after it was
 
06:28:22.270 --> 06:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
introduced last session um some people
 
06:28:24.990 --> 06:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
started even though again no firearms no
 
06:28:28.390 --> 06:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons the issue now apparently
 
06:28:32.150 --> 06:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
is um due process violations um that
 
06:28:34.468 --> 06:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
they feel that the bill violates due
 
06:28:37.628 --> 06:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
process rights because um there is the
 
06:28:40.948 --> 06:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
ability to issue orders um without
 
06:28:43.190 --> 06:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
having a full-blown evidentiary hearing
 
06:28:46.750 --> 06:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
it' be a temporary order and then the um
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
the person who had the uh petition filed
 
06:28:51.070 --> 06:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
against them would have the right to a
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
full hearing to have a final order
 
06:28:54.320 --> 06:28:55.430 align:start position:0%
full hearing to have a final order
issued

06:28:55.430 --> 06:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
issued
 
06:28:59.670 --> 06:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
um so it's hard for me to all I can say
 
06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
about it is and I should also before
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't know who else is going
 
06:29:05.708 --> 06:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
to testify there was also a lot of talk
 
06:29:08.190 --> 06:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
and allegations that this bill allows
 
06:29:11.070 --> 06:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
for telephonic hearings um to take away
 
06:29:13.830 --> 06:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know people's rights and um and with
 
06:29:16.510 --> 06:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
no recourse and I just want to emphasize
 
06:29:19.590 --> 06:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
again that that is absolutely not true
 
06:29:22.788 --> 06:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
just like with the domestic violence um
 
06:29:24.628 --> 06:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
protective orders and stalking there is
 
06:29:26.548 --> 06:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a telephonic
 
06:29:29.350 --> 06:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
conference if the only when the court is
 
06:29:33.270 --> 06:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
not in session and the the any orders
 
06:29:34.868 --> 06:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
that are issued as a result of a
 
06:29:37.350 --> 06:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
telephonic hearing are only good until
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
the next the end of the next open
 
06:29:41.430 --> 06:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
business day of the court so they
 
06:29:44.430 --> 06:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
automatically expire at that point so
 
06:29:47.510 --> 06:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
they do not continue they are very very
 
06:29:49.990 --> 06:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
temporary so I just wanted to get that
 
06:29:51.910 --> 06:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
out of the way I I just want to once
 
06:29:54.628 --> 06:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
again say and Senator sry representative
 
06:29:56.868 --> 06:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
Kush already mentioned this that I mean
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
this bill really is needed more than
 
06:30:01.708 --> 06:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
ever in my opinion um we you already
 
06:30:03.948 --> 06:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
heard from for example Rebecca sky from
 
06:30:05.548 --> 06:30:05.558 align:start position:0%
the state Commission on Aging we're the
 
06:30:09.990 --> 06:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
second oldest um state in the country
 
06:30:12.468 --> 06:30:12.478 align:start position:0%
and we're only getting older um
 
06:30:15.350 --> 06:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
Financial exploitation is a huge problem
 
06:30:17.310 --> 06:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
um across the country and New Hampshire
 
06:30:19.510 --> 06:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
is no exception and the older we get the
 
06:30:22.430 --> 06:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
only bigger the problem is going to get
 
06:30:24.990 --> 06:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
um and already there's it's estimated
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's a big range anywhere between 2.9
 
06:30:31.190 --> 06:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
to 36.5 billion dollar is stolen
 
06:30:34.990 --> 06:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
annually from older adults um again we
 
06:30:37.590 --> 06:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't have this kind of so the idea
 
06:30:40.868 --> 06:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
behind this is that um because there
 
06:30:42.990 --> 06:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
isn't anything in place right now and a
 
06:30:46.150 --> 06:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
quick way to actually get people the
 
06:30:47.788 --> 06:30:47.798 align:start position:0%
relief they need if they're getting
 
06:30:49.628 --> 06:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
financially exploited or if I should say
 
06:30:51.788 --> 06:30:51.798 align:start position:0%
being physically abused as well because
 
06:30:54.070 --> 06:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
that does happen usually Financial abuse
 
06:30:56.350 --> 06:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
goes hand in hand with other kinds of
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
physical abuse so it it's supposed to be
 
06:31:02.070 --> 06:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
for all of it um but it is a way to get
 
06:31:04.430 --> 06:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
this quick relief that is not currently
 
06:31:07.468 --> 06:31:07.478 align:start position:0%
available um in our state and unless
 
06:31:09.150 --> 06:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
again you're a domestic violence victim
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
or a stalking victim so um I you know
 
06:31:15.708 --> 06:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
some of the relief that that would be
 
06:31:17.548 --> 06:31:17.558 align:start position:0%
available is freezing the assets of an
 
06:31:19.670 --> 06:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
abuser prohibiting the abuser for taking
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and converting property um and and and
 
06:31:25.388 --> 06:31:25.398 align:start position:0%
other things such as is that or it could
 
06:31:27.030 --> 06:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
just be obviously just keeping the
 
06:31:29.628 --> 06:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
person away if if the perpetrator is
 
06:31:31.708 --> 06:31:31.718 align:start position:0%
somehow posing some kind of other risk
 
06:31:35.990 --> 06:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
to them um I I would say that sorry
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
sure representative Marsh and
 
06:31:47.350 --> 06:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro have their hands
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
06:31:52.230 --> 06:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
Marsh uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:31:53.948 --> 06:31:53.958 align:start position:0%
you Miss Steinberg for testifying before
 
06:31:55.190 --> 06:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
06:31:57.788 --> 06:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
uh I have on my computer screen here
 
06:32:00.750 --> 06:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
side by side versions of House Bill 1660
 
06:32:03.190 --> 06:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
from last year which the governor V2 on
 
06:32:06.230 --> 06:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
July 28th 2020 and this current bill
 
06:32:09.030 --> 06:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 246 and I see some formating
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
changes which make it a little bit hard
 
06:32:12.670 --> 06:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
to compare the two of them but the only
 
06:32:14.388 --> 06:32:14.398 align:start position:0%
difference I see is the difference in
 
06:32:16.868 --> 06:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
the effective date am I correct about
 
06:32:18.270 --> 06:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
that or could you please walk me through
 
06:32:20.548 --> 06:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
the differences between the two bills no
 
06:32:23.788 --> 06:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct I mean 1660
 
06:32:25.548 --> 06:32:25.558 align:start position:0%
and the bill and I don't remember the
 
06:32:27.990 --> 06:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
number I think it was Senate Bill 677
 
06:32:30.430 --> 06:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
maybe that was introduced last session
 
06:32:32.788 --> 06:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
they were ended up being absolutely
 
06:32:35.990 --> 06:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
identical um so there is no difference
 
06:32:37.350 --> 06:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
um because there was some amendments
 
06:32:39.990 --> 06:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
made but they're exactly the same I mean
 
06:32:42.030 --> 06:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
I should also point out that the the
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
governor's veto message was you know I I
 
06:32:47.310 --> 06:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
would say not accurate and when they
 
06:32:49.110 --> 06:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
said that the Coalition didn't support
 
06:32:51.548 --> 06:32:51.558 align:start position:0%
it that's totally not true as well the
 
06:32:54.388 --> 06:32:54.398 align:start position:0%
Coalition this this bill was a result of
 
06:32:56.350 --> 06:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
it negotiations with the Coalition
 
06:32:58.430 --> 06:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence and
 
06:32:59.788 --> 06:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
there's specific Provisions in there
 
06:33:01.350 --> 06:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
that we agreed to with the language in
 
06:33:04.270 --> 06:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
there that that is in is in this bill
 
06:33:07.270 --> 06:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
and it was in the last bill so I I again
 
06:33:09.868 --> 06:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
I I there the thing that's been
 
06:33:11.830 --> 06:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
frustrating is there's really no logic
 
06:33:13.350 --> 06:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
to a lot of
 
06:33:16.350 --> 06:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
the in my opinion the objections and and
 
06:33:18.590 --> 06:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of the things that say that people
 
06:33:20.270 --> 06:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
say that are wrong with it just it just
 
06:33:22.270 --> 06:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
isn't true it isn't reflected in the
 
06:33:23.750 --> 06:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill I mean so I just urge you to
 
06:33:25.388 --> 06:33:25.398 align:start position:0%
actually read the bill
 
06:33:27.070 --> 06:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
because there's the things that are
 
06:33:28.590 --> 06:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
being claimed that are in there are not
 
06:33:31.670 --> 06:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
in there that's all I can say I I I
 
06:33:36.310 --> 06:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that yeah representative
 
06:33:39.070 --> 06:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:33:42.110 --> 06:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um as you
 
06:33:44.868 --> 06:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
alluded to the concern about
 
06:33:47.510 --> 06:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
confiscation of firearms seems to have
 
06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
morphed into um concerns about due
 
06:33:56.310 --> 06:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
process so could you say could you say
 
06:33:59.310 --> 06:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
specifically um the time frame how much
 
06:34:01.948 --> 06:34:01.958 align:start position:0%
time it would be before a temporary
 
06:34:01.958 --> 06:34:03.788 align:start position:0%
time it would be before a temporary
order

06:34:03.788 --> 06:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
order
 
06:34:09.990 --> 06:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
um is made um and in between when um the
 
06:34:12.190 --> 06:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
defendant would actually be allowed a
 
06:34:15.948 --> 06:34:15.958 align:start position:0%
hearing what is the time I I believe so
 
06:34:17.990 --> 06:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
I believe it's three business days it
 
06:34:20.708 --> 06:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
was actually it was actually abbreviated
 
06:34:22.868 --> 06:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
from what the domestic violence statute
 
06:34:24.310 --> 06:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
provides because there was concerns
 
06:34:28.788 --> 06:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
right raised about that so I believe um
 
06:34:32.150 --> 06:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
I believe it's within three business
 
06:34:37.750 --> 06:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:39.948 --> 06:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
hearing um and I can double check that
 
06:34:42.388 --> 06:34:42.398 align:start position:0%
if you want but it it's it's I believe
 
06:34:43.948 --> 06:34:43.958 align:start position:0%
that's what it was it was two to three
 
06:34:47.788 --> 06:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
business days follow up yeah yes follow
 
06:34:52.110 --> 06:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
up um so as far as you know it's at most
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
three days yeah
 
06:34:57.868 --> 06:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
second thought I have second question I
 
06:35:00.510 --> 06:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
have is I'm kind of concerned about that
 
06:35:03.910 --> 06:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're um on the defense here and talking
 
06:35:06.830 --> 06:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
about why all the reasons why this is a
 
06:35:11.830 --> 06:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
bad Bill are not accurate um so to move
 
06:35:15.070 --> 06:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
towards why this is a good bill um are
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
you or maybe somebody who comes after
 
06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
you able to give an example of the kind
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
of exploitation the kind of abuse that
 
06:35:25.628 --> 06:35:25.638 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fend off with this Bill
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah yeah I know I'm sorry I
 
06:35:28.868 --> 06:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
know I did start out in the defense but
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
I just given the history of what's going
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
on with this bill I just kind of knew it
 
06:35:35.230 --> 06:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
was probably coming I can give you
 
06:35:39.110 --> 06:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
plenty of examples um I'll give you one
 
06:35:41.510 --> 06:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that actually I would tell you a that
 
06:35:44.230 --> 06:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
former Senator Bob K gave at a hearing
 
06:35:46.270 --> 06:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
that involves his brother so he he he
 
06:35:48.670 --> 06:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
made it public so this would be one
 
06:35:51.590 --> 06:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
example I I think a very good example he
 
06:35:56.190 --> 06:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
he is a gentleman who is older um he has
 
06:36:00.110 --> 06:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
a um a disabled 13-year-old son with
 
06:36:04.590 --> 06:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
autism he um had this stepson living in
 
06:36:07.150 --> 06:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
his house it was a stepson by marriage
 
06:36:08.990 --> 06:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
um obviously but they were he was no
 
06:36:10.230 --> 06:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
longer even married so they were
 
06:36:11.948 --> 06:36:11.958 align:start position:0%
divorced but the stepson was living in
 
06:36:14.230 --> 06:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
the house with him and his 13-year-old
 
06:36:16.468 --> 06:36:16.478 align:start position:0%
son and he was always he never
 
06:36:18.030 --> 06:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
contributed anything to the household
 
06:36:20.430 --> 06:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
expenses he didn't pay rent he didn't
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
buy the food um and he was also um I
 
06:36:25.788 --> 06:36:25.798 align:start position:0%
think had substance abuse issues and
 
06:36:29.548 --> 06:36:29.558 align:start position:0%
could be you know very verbally um um
 
06:36:31.990 --> 06:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
abusive and and even physically abusive
 
06:36:35.070 --> 06:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
so at one point um the gentleman went
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
into the hospital and he and he learned
 
06:36:39.948 --> 06:36:39.958 align:start position:0%
that this person the stepson had red
 
06:36:41.708 --> 06:36:41.718 align:start position:0%
havoc in the house and had this party he
 
06:36:44.150 --> 06:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
was making all kinds of problems and so
 
06:36:45.548 --> 06:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
when he got out of the hospital he asked
 
06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
him to leave he say you can't live here
 
06:36:51.110 --> 06:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
anymore the he refused um and he became
 
06:36:53.750 --> 06:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
um physically abusive the gentleman
 
06:36:56.910 --> 06:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
tried to go and file a 173b a domestic
 
06:36:58.750 --> 06:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
violence restraining order they told him
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
sorry you don't qualify and and he
 
06:37:02.990 --> 06:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
didn't under the statute he didn't meet
 
06:37:06.788 --> 06:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
the criteria um so um then they told him
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
go to the police the police will issue a
 
06:37:10.230 --> 06:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
no trespass order the police told him
 
06:37:12.670 --> 06:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
sorry we can't help you um because you
 
06:37:13.910 --> 06:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
know it's not clear that he's a
 
06:37:15.510 --> 06:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
trespasser because he has been living
 
06:37:18.590 --> 06:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
here finally we got involved and I was
 
06:37:22.510 --> 06:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
able with some effort to get the um I
 
06:37:24.350 --> 06:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
believe I got you finally finally got
 
06:37:26.468 --> 06:37:26.478 align:start position:0%
the police to issue a node
 
06:37:29.430 --> 06:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
trespass um order to get him out of
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
there and he did finally leave but it
 
06:37:34.590 --> 06:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
you know it was a lot of work and we had
 
06:37:36.788 --> 06:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
to get involved so I mean I think that's
 
06:37:39.190 --> 06:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
one good example I I'll give another
 
06:37:41.510 --> 06:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
very quickly an example of of another
 
06:37:44.548 --> 06:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
common situation where um you know we
 
06:37:46.868 --> 06:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
have these adult parents who give their
 
06:37:49.590 --> 06:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
homes to their adult children free and
 
06:37:51.788 --> 06:37:51.798 align:start position:0%
clear adult parents sorry parents that
 
06:37:53.150 --> 06:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
give to their adult children free and
 
06:37:57.190 --> 06:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
clear and something happens and next
 
06:37:59.150 --> 06:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
thing you know that the the children are
 
06:38:01.030 --> 06:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
saying sorry you we you can't live here
 
06:38:03.230 --> 06:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
anymore we can't afford it or no they
 
06:38:04.910 --> 06:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
the house is getting foreclosed down
 
06:38:05.910 --> 06:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
because even though it didn't have a
 
06:38:08.670 --> 06:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
mortgage when you gave it to me we've
 
06:38:10.468 --> 06:38:10.478 align:start position:0%
we've got mortgage it up to the hill we
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
can't make the payments so you got to
 
06:38:15.670 --> 06:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
get out so I mean we had a a case like
 
06:38:18.628 --> 06:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
that where the the um the children had
 
06:38:21.110 --> 06:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
put the house on the market and my 80
 
06:38:22.948 --> 06:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
you know four year old client had
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go and she was looking for an
 
06:38:26.910 --> 06:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
apartment she didn't know what to do and
 
06:38:28.548 --> 06:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
the only way to really stop this sale
 
06:38:30.590 --> 06:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
from going forward was to go to Superior
 
06:38:32.430 --> 06:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
Court and file a petition and that's
 
06:38:34.270 --> 06:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
very complicated and she couldn't do
 
06:38:37.030 --> 06:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
that herself I mean so we were luckily
 
06:38:39.708 --> 06:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
she was able to connect with us and we
 
06:38:42.388 --> 06:38:42.398 align:start position:0%
um got you know we got a petition filed
 
06:38:45.070 --> 06:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
and got the sales stop but you know but
 
06:38:47.110 --> 06:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
for that it wouldn't happen you know and
 
06:38:50.070 --> 06:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
and so this having this type of relief
 
06:38:53.670 --> 06:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
available would actually allow her
 
06:38:55.350 --> 06:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
someone like her just to fill out a
 
06:38:58.670 --> 06:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
simple form and get the relief
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
immediately without having to worry
 
06:39:02.948 --> 06:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
about all kinds of complicated petitions
 
06:39:04.990 --> 06:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court and Hope You Know M
 
06:39:06.310 --> 06:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
and hopefully connecting with New
 
06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance for
 
06:39:12.190 --> 06:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
help does that help thank
 
06:39:22.430 --> 06:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:24.990 --> 06:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:39:27.270 --> 06:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr
 
06:39:30.468 --> 06:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just looking very closely
 
06:39:34.388 --> 06:39:34.398 align:start position:0%
and um I see under temporary relief it
 
06:39:36.670 --> 06:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
gives upon showing of immediate and
 
06:39:38.590 --> 06:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
present danger of abuse exploitation
 
06:39:41.070 --> 06:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
neglect the court may enter temporary
 
06:39:45.070 --> 06:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
order um and that they will be effective
 
06:39:46.830 --> 06:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
until the close of the next regular
 
06:39:48.868 --> 06:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
Court business
 
06:39:51.750 --> 06:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
day then they go back to the court where
 
06:39:52.948 --> 06:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff
 
06:39:52.958 --> 06:39:54.510 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff
resides

06:39:54.510 --> 06:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
resides
 
06:39:57.110 --> 06:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and they do not have to make actual
 
06:39:59.468 --> 06:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
notice to the
 
06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
defendant yes um the hearing shall be
 
06:40:04.990 --> 06:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
held no less than two business days and
 
06:40:07.150 --> 06:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
no more than three days after request is
 
06:40:09.708 --> 06:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
received by the clerk um but then it
 
06:40:12.750 --> 06:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
says the orders may include and then it
 
06:40:16.548 --> 06:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
lists um you know a one two 3 four five
 
06:40:20.590 --> 06:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:24.548 --> 06:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
I page five I'm sorry six of page five
 
06:40:26.590 --> 06:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
it says other relief including but not
 
06:40:30.788 --> 06:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
limited to so there is room there uh
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
even though the the petitioner may not
 
06:40:37.910 --> 06:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
ask the court to confiscate Firearms if
 
06:40:41.830 --> 06:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
in their report um they make
 
06:40:45.150 --> 06:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
mention um of firearms existing in the
 
06:40:48.910 --> 06:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
home a judge could then make an order
 
06:40:52.430 --> 06:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
because they're not limited by this bill
 
06:40:57.150 --> 06:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:01.788 --> 06:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
correct um I would say I I would I I
 
06:41:04.388 --> 06:41:04.398 align:start position:0%
guess I would defer to the the judicial
 
06:41:06.670 --> 06:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
branch to answer that question and how
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
they would interpret it I would say that
 
06:41:11.310 --> 06:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
I have heard um the judicial branch say
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
in the district court they don't feel
 
06:41:16.430 --> 06:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to um place a
 
06:41:19.750 --> 06:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
broad interpretation on these kinds of
 
06:41:22.230 --> 06:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
laws so that unless it's explicitly
 
06:41:23.830 --> 06:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
written in there they they they're
 
06:41:28.788 --> 06:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:34.468 --> 06:41:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:39.030 --> 06:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:41.868 --> 06:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
chairman yes representative Merchant
 
06:41:44.948 --> 06:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I don't if this
 
06:41:48.430 --> 06:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
goes to someone on the committee but
 
06:41:51.310 --> 06:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
helped me understand last year this bill
 
06:41:54.150 --> 06:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
appears to be vetted by this committee
 
06:41:56.388 --> 06:41:56.398 align:start position:0%
um and passed the committee went on to
 
06:41:58.628 --> 06:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
the house and get passed to the to the
 
06:42:01.230 --> 06:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
Senate then beo by the governor was it a
 
06:42:03.350 --> 06:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
standalone Bill Governor vetoed or was
 
06:42:05.830 --> 06:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
it part of an Omnibus package that the
 
06:42:08.590 --> 06:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
governor veto I'm trying to track down
 
06:42:12.070 --> 06:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
why it was a it was a standalone Bill he
 
06:42:15.788 --> 06:42:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:19.230 --> 06:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
it where one find
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that um I'm happy to um send it to you
 
06:42:26.070 --> 06:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
email thank
 
06:42:31.310 --> 06:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:33.910 --> 06:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
Kelsey yes thank you Mr chairman um I
 
06:42:36.708 --> 06:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
have a question what specific due
 
06:42:39.948 --> 06:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
process protections are in this bill and
 
06:42:42.230 --> 06:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
does this meet all the Constitutional
 
06:42:44.670 --> 06:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
requirements of not taking property
 
06:42:46.910 --> 06:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
prior to being found guilty in a court
 
06:42:48.910 --> 06:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
of law with an attorney
 
06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
present okay
 
06:42:54.388 --> 06:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
well okay it it it absolutely complies
 
06:42:56.468 --> 06:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
with due process the due process is is
 
06:42:59.310 --> 06:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
that they that the defendant is getting
 
06:43:01.548 --> 06:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
notice of this petition being filed and
 
06:43:04.670 --> 06:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
the right to appeal to to request a
 
06:43:08.510 --> 06:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
hearing um yes there is some ability for
 
06:43:10.110 --> 06:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
the court to issue some orders before
 
06:43:11.830 --> 06:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
there is a full-blown hearing but that
 
06:43:14.750 --> 06:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
is consistent with due process has been
 
06:43:18.750 --> 06:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
upheld by the court as totally
 
06:43:20.628 --> 06:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
consistent with complying with due
 
06:43:23.388 --> 06:43:23.398 align:start position:0%
process requirements so it's no
 
06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
different than what happens in the
 
06:43:28.350 --> 06:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
context of a domestic violence
 
06:43:31.230 --> 06:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
protective order um situation or a
 
06:43:33.548 --> 06:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
stalking situation or other situations
 
06:43:36.990 --> 06:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
there is the ability to
 
06:43:40.030 --> 06:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
temporarily um make orders and
 
06:43:42.070 --> 06:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
potentially deprive people of certain
 
06:43:44.750 --> 06:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
property or whatever right you want to
 
06:43:47.110 --> 06:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
call it before there's a full-blown
 
06:43:50.110 --> 06:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing in the court so
 
06:43:51.948 --> 06:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
that's all I can tell you it's it's it's
 
06:43:54.750 --> 06:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
very it's settled law
 
06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
um I I understand that some people don't
 
06:43:59.150 --> 06:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
like it but it's settled law there
 
06:44:02.030 --> 06:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
really is no controversy about it
 
06:44:04.110 --> 06:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank
 
06:44:09.230 --> 06:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:18.628 --> 06:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:22.948 --> 06:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
question oh can you hear me y okay thank
 
06:44:22.958 --> 06:44:24.270 align:start position:0%
question oh can you hear me y okay thank
you

06:44:24.270 --> 06:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:44:25.990 --> 06:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
every time I have to do this differently
 
06:44:28.830 --> 06:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman when the temporary
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
order is given there is
 
06:44:34.510 --> 06:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
a next court date or at least in three
 
06:44:36.590 --> 06:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
days there has to be an evidential re
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
hearing does the defendant have to
 
06:44:41.430 --> 06:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
request that evidentiary hearing or does
 
06:44:44.030 --> 06:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
it automatically occur on the next
 
06:44:47.670 --> 06:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
day for the expedited hearing I believe
 
06:44:50.190 --> 06:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
they have to request it otherwise it'll
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
be scheduled within 30
 
06:44:55.190 --> 06:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
days thank
 
06:44:59.510 --> 06:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:03.230 --> 06:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
kofalt yes uh so so I believe uh that
 
06:45:04.350 --> 06:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
06:45:08.270 --> 06:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned that this has been uh
 
06:45:11.468 --> 06:45:11.478 align:start position:0%
this this has been covered several times
 
06:45:12.948 --> 06:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would go back to two years
 
06:45:15.868 --> 06:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
ago I think the the word Firearms was
 
06:45:18.388 --> 06:45:18.398 align:start position:0%
mentioned close to 20 times in that bill
 
06:45:23.270 --> 06:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
so for those who have um questions as to
 
06:45:26.788 --> 06:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
why this might be interpreted as a a
 
06:45:29.468 --> 06:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
concern by Second Amendment Advocates I
 
06:45:32.070 --> 06:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say that that that's why
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
having removed those references to
 
06:45:38.350 --> 06:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
Firearms uh is is potentially a step in
 
06:45:39.230 --> 06:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
the right
 
06:45:42.310 --> 06:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
direction uh my my question for the the
 
06:45:44.910 --> 06:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor and for attorney
 
06:45:46.510 --> 06:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
Steinberg is whether you believe it
 
06:45:48.230 --> 06:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable if this bill were
 
06:45:52.788 --> 06:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
modified to uh strictly prohibit uh the
 
06:45:54.910 --> 06:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
seizure of firearms or orders to
 
06:45:54.920 --> 06:45:56.430 align:start position:0%
seizure of firearms or orders to
surrender

06:45:56.430 --> 06:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
surrender
 
06:45:59.830 --> 06:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
Firearms um would would that be uh
 
06:46:02.548 --> 06:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
acceptable within uh within this bill
 
06:46:05.190 --> 06:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to you uh I
 
06:46:07.948 --> 06:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess um I mean honestly this
 
06:46:10.430 --> 06:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
was never about Firearms it was again
 
06:46:11.910 --> 06:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
just something that was modeled on an
 
06:46:14.430 --> 06:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
already existing statute I mean I do
 
06:46:16.430 --> 06:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
have some problems with I mean obviously
 
06:46:18.430 --> 06:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
if it's strictly Financial exploitation
 
06:46:20.468 --> 06:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
and there's really no physical violence
 
06:46:23.430 --> 06:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
I I really having the the guns are
 
06:46:25.628 --> 06:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
relevant as far as I'm concerned so yes
 
06:46:27.590 --> 06:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know if there's really some physical
 
06:46:28.750 --> 06:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we're really talking about
 
06:46:30.430 --> 06:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
someone that's being physically abused
 
06:46:32.788 --> 06:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
and there's been a weapon involved I
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's where I guess I I would maybe
 
06:46:37.750 --> 06:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about just making a
 
06:46:39.708 --> 06:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
Flatout prohibition under any
 
06:46:41.548 --> 06:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances like to have the court to
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
have some discretion but so F follow up
 
06:46:47.868 --> 06:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
to that question wouldn't actually two
 
06:46:49.708 --> 06:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
follow-ups I'll ask them together
 
06:46:51.350 --> 06:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be wouldn't that latter
 
06:46:54.310 --> 06:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
scenario be covered under existing
 
06:46:57.070 --> 06:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence scenarios number
 
06:46:59.590 --> 06:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
one no it wouldn't no it wouldn't can
 
06:47:01.590 --> 06:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
you can you elaborate on that please
 
06:47:03.468 --> 06:47:03.478 align:start position:0%
well because I mean unless the
 
06:47:05.708 --> 06:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adult is also a domestic
 
06:47:07.350 --> 06:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
violence victim within the meaning of
 
06:47:08.990 --> 06:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
06:47:11.190 --> 06:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
173b then they they won't they aren't
 
06:47:12.788 --> 06:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
entitled to that
 
06:47:15.750 --> 06:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
relief um so you know there are the
 
06:47:17.230 --> 06:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
people were Tau this is the whole thing
 
06:47:19.510 --> 06:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
the people we're talking about are not
 
06:47:21.270 --> 06:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
really domestic violence victims they're
 
06:47:24.310 --> 06:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
are people that are um
 
06:47:26.510 --> 06:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adults that a lot of times
 
06:47:29.670 --> 06:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
what it is is the abuse takes place by
 
06:47:33.030 --> 06:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
caregivers and um it could be hired
 
06:47:35.230 --> 06:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
caregivers it could be I mean it could
 
06:47:37.350 --> 06:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
be a family member um but not
 
06:47:39.430 --> 06:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily living with them so there's
 
06:47:42.190 --> 06:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
certain requirements under 173b about
 
06:47:43.868 --> 06:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
they need to be a household member and
 
06:47:45.628 --> 06:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
they need to be or an intimate partner
 
06:47:47.388 --> 06:47:47.398 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know all the criteria of
 
06:47:49.708 --> 06:47:49.718 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but the whole idea is
 
06:47:51.230 --> 06:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be for people that
 
06:47:53.270 --> 06:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't meet that criteria and that's why
 
06:47:55.590 --> 06:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
we need the bill is because there's this
 
06:47:57.628 --> 06:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
group of people that aren't covered that
 
06:47:57.638 --> 06:47:58.628 align:start position:0%
group of people that aren't covered that
are

06:47:58.628 --> 06:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:48:01.548 --> 06:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and need the
 
06:48:03.670 --> 06:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
help okay so that would potentially
 
06:48:06.750 --> 06:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
indicate some some need for revisions to
 
06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence uh statute I I I
 
06:48:12.310 --> 06:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
heard you say attorney Steinberg that
 
06:48:15.430 --> 06:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is really primarily about financial
 
06:48:18.910 --> 06:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
abuse or financial concerns and so I my
 
06:48:21.910 --> 06:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question is why not then
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
limit it to Financial abuse so that uh
 
06:48:28.788 --> 06:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
so that we can um address people's
 
06:48:31.350 --> 06:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
concerns and and uh and and get
 
06:48:32.510 --> 06:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
something through that could protect
 
06:48:35.430 --> 06:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
Elders from that Financial abuse yeah
 
06:48:38.110 --> 06:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
well as I think I did say it it isn't I
 
06:48:40.708 --> 06:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
mean that that is I I will say I mean
 
06:48:42.708 --> 06:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
yes in all fairness Financial
 
06:48:45.590 --> 06:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
exploitation is the biggest part of the
 
06:48:49.070 --> 06:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
issue but there is also physical abuse
 
06:48:51.388 --> 06:48:51.398 align:start position:0%
and neglect that takes place for these
 
06:48:53.788 --> 06:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
individuals and the first example I gave
 
06:48:57.670 --> 06:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
you the story um first story I gave you
 
06:48:59.350 --> 06:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
involves someone who is being physically
 
06:49:01.468 --> 06:49:01.478 align:start position:0%
abused not you know I guess he was being
 
06:49:03.388 --> 06:49:03.398 align:start position:0%
he was being financially exploited as
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
well and he's someone that wouldn't be
 
06:49:07.310 --> 06:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
able to get relief under
 
06:49:10.270 --> 06:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
173b so I I mean I I guess the thing is
 
06:49:13.030 --> 06:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
this I don't understand why
 
06:49:16.388 --> 06:49:16.398 align:start position:0%
um people in this population shouldn't
 
06:49:19.230 --> 06:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
have the same kinds of protections that
 
06:49:22.548 --> 06:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
other people do and I I get that you
 
06:49:24.628 --> 06:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
know it makes it easier to say it's just
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
Financial exploitation and therefore we
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
can prohibit the guns and but again
 
06:49:30.948 --> 06:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here now that's going
 
06:49:33.110 --> 06:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
to allow for the confiscation of weapons
 
06:49:36.310 --> 06:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
so I but you know I I don't know what to
 
06:49:38.030 --> 06:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
do at this point because I do think this
 
06:49:43.150 --> 06:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
is unfortunately um I it's just become
 
06:49:45.110 --> 06:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
so politicized and now it you know
 
06:49:47.350 --> 06:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
people feel it's this threat against
 
06:49:50.670 --> 06:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
Firearms um and getting taken away and
 
06:49:52.670 --> 06:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
it just isn't the case in my opinion
 
06:49:54.350 --> 06:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would not do that and isn't
 
06:49:56.510 --> 06:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
what it's intended to do and we got rid
 
06:49:59.788 --> 06:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
of all the references they're all
 
06:49:59.798 --> 06:50:01.788 align:start position:0%
of all the references they're all
gone

06:50:01.788 --> 06:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
gone
 
06:50:04.430 --> 06:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I have a follow-up question is in the
 
06:50:05.910 --> 06:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
scenario you described earlier where
 
06:50:07.868 --> 06:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
there was actual physical abuse
 
06:50:11.750 --> 06:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
happening um if that were were not to
 
06:50:13.910 --> 06:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
fall under the domestic violence uh
 
06:50:18.110 --> 06:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
statute would it not be covered under
 
06:50:20.868 --> 06:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening and assault it
 
06:50:22.190 --> 06:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
would but that's not going to get him
 
06:50:25.150 --> 06:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
immediate release I mean you know maybe
 
06:50:27.548 --> 06:50:27.558 align:start position:0%
he'll may it doesn't provide the same
 
06:50:29.590 --> 06:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
kind of protection I mean the criminal
 
06:50:32.750 --> 06:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
statute will will potentially punish the
 
06:50:35.868 --> 06:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
offender but it it doesn't automatically
 
06:50:38.110 --> 06:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide any mechanism for this
 
06:50:40.430 --> 06:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
victim to automatically get relief to
 
06:50:42.310 --> 06:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
get the person away from him and you
 
06:50:44.310 --> 06:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
know I criminal investigations I mean it
 
06:50:46.990 --> 06:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
isn't my area but I I don't know that
 
06:50:49.590 --> 06:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily true that the person's
 
06:50:51.110 --> 06:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to be immediately charged with a
 
06:50:53.468 --> 06:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
crime and immediately go before the
 
06:50:56.868 --> 06:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
court and have any kind of you know
 
06:50:59.948 --> 06:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
action taken so um it's a different it's
 
06:51:03.030 --> 06:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
it know the part of this whole you know
 
06:51:04.590 --> 06:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing I should emphasize is
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
the whole idea behind this is to try to
 
06:51:08.310 --> 06:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully prevent bad things from
 
06:51:10.948 --> 06:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
happening you know and not have to react
 
06:51:12.628 --> 06:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
after the bad thing has happened which
 
06:51:15.510 --> 06:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
is what the criminal statutes do so I
 
06:51:19.430 --> 06:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
mean we're trying to minimize harm and
 
06:51:22.190 --> 06:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
trying to give victims a tool that they
 
06:51:24.628 --> 06:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
can use to protect
 
06:51:27.150 --> 06:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
themselves and you know while the
 
06:51:29.310 --> 06:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes are very important and
 
06:51:30.910 --> 06:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
I would say the the financial
 
06:51:32.830 --> 06:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
exploitation criminal statute that we
 
06:51:34.548 --> 06:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
helped put into place several years ago
 
06:51:38.510 --> 06:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
has been a really great tool um that I'm
 
06:51:41.910 --> 06:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
very happy is there it's it isn't enough
 
06:51:43.948 --> 06:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
you know it it doesn't provide this
 
06:51:46.750 --> 06:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
other type of relief for the victims you
 
06:51:47.868 --> 06:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
know I
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
mean the know again the example again
 
06:51:52.350 --> 06:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
I'll use the a financial example
 
06:51:54.830 --> 06:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
someone's you know someone's stealing a
 
06:51:57.670 --> 06:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
victim's money um okay great they get
 
06:51:59.388 --> 06:51:59.398 align:start position:0%
charged after all the money is gone this
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
would be a way to go to court quicker
 
06:52:03.948 --> 06:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
get an immediate order to stop the
 
06:52:06.708 --> 06:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
bleeding so that it it so they won't
 
06:52:09.548 --> 06:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
become destitute so that that's kind
 
06:52:13.310 --> 06:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
part of the idea too so um it's a pre
 
06:52:14.788 --> 06:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's really supposed to be preventative
 
06:52:18.510 --> 06:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
in nature and try to minimize harm as
 
06:52:21.230 --> 06:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
much as possible on victims thank you
 
06:52:23.948 --> 06:52:23.958 align:start position:0%
representative fome your next on my list
 
06:52:26.670 --> 06:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
and um much has been said much has been
 
06:52:29.310 --> 06:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
said several times I'm going to ask both
 
06:52:33.150 --> 06:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
the question respondents to uh focus on
 
06:52:36.548 --> 06:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
new material and not repetition please
 
06:52:39.750 --> 06:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative Fon thank you Mr chair um
 
06:52:42.190 --> 06:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
thanks I'm actually moving very far away
 
06:52:44.910 --> 06:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
from that and you probably can answer my
 
06:52:47.190 --> 06:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
question because it's might be covered
 
06:52:50.388 --> 06:52:50.398 align:start position:0%
in other law but as I was looking at
 
06:52:54.788 --> 06:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
this and uh the um person may have the
 
06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh have to sign this worksheet and say
 
06:52:58.948 --> 06:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
I'm freely choosing to file this
 
06:53:02.910 --> 06:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
petition and on and on um when I think
 
06:53:06.430 --> 06:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
of vulnerable adults I'm also thinking
 
06:53:09.150 --> 06:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
of of adults that may have a
 
06:53:09.160 --> 06:53:10.788 align:start position:0%
of of adults that may have a
developmental

06:53:10.788 --> 06:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
06:53:14.150 --> 06:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
disability which would not make them a
 
06:53:16.070 --> 06:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
great candidate for making this kind of
 
06:53:19.230 --> 06:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
a decision and the person who has been
 
06:53:21.750 --> 06:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
abusing them may have been
 
06:53:24.788 --> 06:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
their legal guardian or
 
06:53:28.788 --> 06:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
trustee and I'm sure that they can come
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
in quickly and I'm assuming get rid of
 
06:53:36.070 --> 06:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
that person in a totally different way
 
06:53:39.670 --> 06:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
but how then do you what would it look
 
06:53:39.680 --> 06:53:42.190 align:start position:0%
but how then do you what would it look
like

06:53:42.190 --> 06:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:53:45.548 --> 06:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
if what would it look like for that that
 
06:53:47.350 --> 06:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
adult who has
 
06:53:50.230 --> 06:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
been not necessarily physically abused
 
06:53:53.388 --> 06:53:53.398 align:start position:0%
but financially or emotionally
 
06:53:56.070 --> 06:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
abused um what what is that process
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
going to look like with those type of of
 
06:54:02.830 --> 06:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities okay so you I was just
 
06:54:04.388 --> 06:54:04.398 align:start position:0%
so to make sure you want to know about
 
06:54:07.990 --> 06:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
the worksheet in particular or um I
 
06:54:11.868 --> 06:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
could oh think about the fact
 
06:54:15.708 --> 06:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
that um the worksheet U made me think
 
06:54:20.430 --> 06:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
about the a vulnerable adults yes
 
06:54:23.388 --> 06:54:23.398 align:start position:0%
disabled come in then and me immediately
 
06:54:26.868 --> 06:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
does the court step in and provide them
 
06:54:29.270 --> 06:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
with a
 
06:54:33.230 --> 06:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
temporary Garden okay yeah let me okay a
 
06:54:36.070 --> 06:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
lot of things to unpack there so the
 
06:54:39.150 --> 06:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
worksheet was a compromise that we
 
06:54:41.468 --> 06:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
worked out with the courts and the
 
06:54:43.388 --> 06:54:43.398 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Coalition because the
 
06:54:44.868 --> 06:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Coalition was
 
06:54:46.670 --> 06:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
concerned with that that this bill
 
06:54:49.350 --> 06:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
because all the ability to confiscate
 
06:54:52.270 --> 06:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
Firearms was taken away that there could
 
06:54:55.190 --> 06:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
be people um that were domestic violence
 
06:54:57.708 --> 06:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
victims that would choose to for
 
06:55:00.110 --> 06:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reason apply for this relief
 
06:55:02.110 --> 06:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
under the vulnerable adult statute
 
06:55:03.910 --> 06:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
versus a domestic violence statute would
 
06:55:05.990 --> 06:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
be giving up their rights to get their
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
firearms confiscated no the the the vi
 
06:55:13.070 --> 06:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh perpetrators Firearms confiscated so
 
06:55:16.190 --> 06:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
we worked that out with the worksheet so
 
06:55:18.788 --> 06:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
that the victim could work through and
 
06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
understand that if they applied for
 
06:55:23.628 --> 06:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
Relief under this
 
06:55:26.628 --> 06:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
particular law that they would not be
 
06:55:28.670 --> 06:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
able to add that the court would not
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to issue an order to
 
06:55:35.150 --> 06:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
confiscate the perpetrators Firearms the
 
06:55:40.150 --> 06:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
defendants Firearms so I I as far as yes
 
06:55:42.548 --> 06:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
so so that's why that's in there it was
 
06:55:45.708 --> 06:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
not in there originally so that's number
 
06:55:48.070 --> 06:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
one number two yes I understand what
 
06:55:49.910 --> 06:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying there are there very well
 
06:55:51.548 --> 06:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
could be some people that might have
 
06:55:53.990 --> 06:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
some challenges maybe understanding just
 
06:55:57.070 --> 06:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
even how to complete a petition um I
 
06:55:58.628 --> 06:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
would say one of the things that's in
 
06:56:01.510 --> 06:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is that someone from the Bureau
 
06:56:03.590 --> 06:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services an adult
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
protective worker with the victim's
 
06:56:08.110 --> 06:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
permission can help them complete the
 
06:56:12.910 --> 06:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
form so that's one way they can get help
 
06:56:14.548 --> 06:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
um the other way is hopefully actually
 
06:56:16.510 --> 06:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
we put this that's why is that the
 
06:56:18.070 --> 06:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
information in that worksheet is in
 
06:56:20.030 --> 06:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
there too is that they can contact
 
06:56:22.948 --> 06:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
either the Coalition or New Hampshire
 
06:56:26.270 --> 06:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
legal assistance for help too um and
 
06:56:28.510 --> 06:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
then we would hope to get them connected
 
06:56:32.510 --> 06:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
somehow um to the help they need it is
 
06:56:34.868 --> 06:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
it isn't perfect I I but it's one of
 
06:56:36.788 --> 06:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
those things that I I don't you know we
 
06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
try to do the best we can to see make
 
06:56:41.350 --> 06:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
sure that people um understand what
 
06:56:43.590 --> 06:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing and can get the relief
 
06:56:45.788 --> 06:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
they need but um yeah oh and I should
 
06:56:47.548 --> 06:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
also point out there is a provision in
 
06:56:49.750 --> 06:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that allows the court to
 
06:56:53.030 --> 06:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
appoint a guarding Ed item if the plaint
 
06:56:55.708 --> 06:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
if really if the victim really is unable
 
06:56:58.388 --> 06:56:58.398 align:start position:0%
to you know there's concerns about them
 
06:57:00.110 --> 06:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
being able to make their own decisions
 
06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that's in the bill as well thank you
 
06:57:04.788 --> 06:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
can you just point that out for me in
 
06:57:21.388 --> 06:57:21.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:25.670 --> 06:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:34.868 --> 06:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:34.878 --> 06:57:51.310 align:start position:0%
 
21

06:57:51.310 --> 06:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:51.320 --> 06:58:22.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:58:22.110 --> 06:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:25.708 --> 06:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
okay okay um before I call the next uh
 
06:58:29.510 --> 06:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
questioner just to announce um we've got
 
06:58:31.310 --> 06:58:31.320 align:start position:0%

06:59:25.590 --> 06:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:59:28.868 --> 06:59:28.878 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman um not
 
06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
being an attorney I don't know where I'm
 
06:59:32.708 --> 06:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
going in this I may put myself into a
 
06:59:35.430 --> 06:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
bucket of what but I'm looking at this
 
06:59:40.468 --> 06:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
whole issue of abuse and I looked at RSA
 
06:59:43.150 --> 06:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
173 B1
 
06:59:46.350 --> 06:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
definitions is it possible to include
 
06:59:48.310 --> 06:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
economic safety which is basically
 
06:59:51.628 --> 06:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
Financial exploitation that domestic
 
06:59:54.388 --> 06:59:54.398 align:start position:0%
violence and includes that definition
 
06:59:57.628 --> 06:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
economic safety and that that that would
 
06:59:58.750 --> 06:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
take care of the
 
07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
issue um well it certainly 173b could be
 
07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
amended to do that but again the thing
 
07:00:08.868 --> 07:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
with the domestic violence statute is
 
07:00:10.910 --> 07:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
that the people that actually are
 
07:00:13.750 --> 07:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for the relief are different
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
than the people contemplated in this
 
07:00:17.708 --> 07:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
bill who are vulnerable
 
07:00:21.670 --> 07:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
adults so um domestic violence victims
 
07:00:22.830 --> 07:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
have one
 
07:00:25.150 --> 07:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
definition and vulnerable adults have a
 
07:00:28.788 --> 07:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
different definition and so so and and
 
07:00:31.350 --> 07:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes there could be an overlap but
 
07:00:32.750 --> 07:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
really for the most part they're two
 
07:00:34.910 --> 07:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
distinct types of
 
07:00:37.468 --> 07:00:37.478 align:start position:0%
groups thank
 
07:00:49.310 --> 07:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:51.510 --> 07:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
attorney thank you counselor for your
 
07:00:53.030 --> 07:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and for your help in
 
07:00:55.830 --> 07:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
explaining things no problem thank you I
 
07:00:57.830 --> 07:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
I I hope I did sign up just so you know
 
07:00:59.430 --> 07:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I know you I'm sorry if you
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
didn't see my name but I I did sign up
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
earlier today just so you
 
07:01:07.430 --> 07:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
know think I was being presumptuous here
 
07:01:09.510 --> 07:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know what happened but
 
07:01:12.070 --> 07:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm happy to if
 
07:01:13.948 --> 07:01:13.958 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to ask me any other
 
07:01:15.910 --> 07:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions after the hearing I'm happy to

173d colon 3 judici you know the um
 
07:02:14.590 --> 07:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
courts and
 
07:02:18.350 --> 07:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
venue and it's the first line if you
 
07:02:22.708 --> 07:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
look at 173 D3 in the bill the district
 
07:02:25.990 --> 07:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
division in the Judiciary Branch Family
 
07:02:30.190 --> 07:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
Division of the Circuit Court shall have
 
07:02:32.708 --> 07:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
current uh Judiciary you know if I can
 
07:02:34.948 --> 07:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
say that word right I apologize over all
 
07:02:37.670 --> 07:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
proceeding what page in line is this do
 
07:02:39.948 --> 07:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
you know I'm looking online I think it's
 
07:02:42.270 --> 07:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
on page one or possibly two but I'm
 
07:02:46.990 --> 07:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
looking online you know I Mr chairman it
 
07:02:52.150 --> 07:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
it is uh page two lines 19 and 20 thank
 
07:02:55.468 --> 07:02:55.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you whoever said
 
07:02:57.990 --> 07:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
that and uh but it says the district you
 
07:03:00.548 --> 07:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
know the courts have control over this
 
07:03:03.548 --> 07:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
over all proceedings under this chapter
 
07:03:05.708 --> 07:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
now what that
 
07:03:11.350 --> 07:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
means is is bottom line what it means
 
07:03:16.190 --> 07:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
is judges have the authority to remove
 
07:03:17.548 --> 07:03:17.558 align:start position:0%
guns out of any
 
07:03:21.110 --> 07:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
home in this type of a situation now if
 
07:03:23.788 --> 07:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
they think it's a abuse or any other
 
07:03:26.990 --> 07:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
crime like that they are going to say
 
07:03:30.070 --> 07:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
remove the guns because if one shooting
 
07:03:32.628 --> 07:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
happens which you know chances are it w
 
07:03:33.990 --> 07:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
but if one
 
07:03:36.830 --> 07:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
did it would not look good in the court
 
07:03:39.190 --> 07:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
system so that's why they're going to do
 
07:03:42.468 --> 07:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
that so this bill really does have a lot
 
07:03:45.270 --> 07:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
of you know flaws in that area now
 
07:03:46.830 --> 07:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of speakers and I want to
 
07:03:48.910 --> 07:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
get to them so I just want to say I
 
07:03:51.350 --> 07:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and Mr chairman and
 
07:03:51.360 --> 07:03:52.590 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and Mr chairman and
committee

07:03:52.590 --> 07:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:03:55.670 --> 07:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
members you know the bill is the same as
 
07:03:58.830 --> 07:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
last year this is a gun grab bill in my
 
07:04:01.868 --> 07:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
eyes so please oppose this and let's
 
07:04:04.350 --> 07:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
move on to uh better bills and um get
 
07:04:06.468 --> 07:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
those passed thank you Mr chairman and
 
07:04:09.548 --> 07:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
have a good day representative I have a
 
07:04:11.910 --> 07:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
question I'm convincible but I need to
 
07:04:16.310 --> 07:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
be convinced yes are there other places
 
07:04:19.990 --> 07:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill that irrespective of guns
 
07:04:22.830 --> 07:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
now you would say is a bad
 
07:04:26.388 --> 07:04:26.398 align:start position:0%
Bill uh there is and there are a couple
 
07:04:28.830 --> 07:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
speakers behind me that will fill you in
 
07:04:30.948 --> 07:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
on those um because I don't have the
 
07:04:33.030 --> 07:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
notes right in front of me to point to
 
07:04:35.990 --> 07:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
that section so I apologize um I just
 
07:04:38.150 --> 07:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
came you know with this one particular
 
07:04:40.430 --> 07:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
area that I wanted to point out but
 
07:04:43.150 --> 07:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
there are other areas that uh other
 
07:04:44.830 --> 07:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
people that are going to speak hopefully
 
07:04:46.670 --> 07:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
we can get them all in before 4:30 and
 
07:04:49.310 --> 07:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to make my
 
07:04:51.750 --> 07:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimony we've got 11 people in the
 
07:04:55.030 --> 07:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
addition to the names I've already been
 
07:04:58.190 --> 07:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
sent we'll keep at it all right thank
 
07:04:59.868 --> 07:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and hopefully we can get
 
07:05:01.628 --> 07:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
everybody to speak because hopefully if
 
07:05:03.468 --> 07:05:03.478 align:start position:0%
you only have one or two left over by
 
07:05:05.708 --> 07:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
4:30 then you know hopefully you'll hear
 
07:05:07.230 --> 07:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
them because it would be a pain to
 
07:05:10.230 --> 07:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
reopen right now the chair recognizes
 
07:05:13.388 --> 07:05:13.398 align:start position:0%

in support of HB

246 I myself am a person with a severe
 
07:06:21.388 --> 07:06:21.398 align:start position:0%
physical disability I live with a
 
07:06:21.398 --> 07:06:22.270 align:start position:0%
physical disability I live with a
condition

07:06:22.270 --> 07:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
condition
 
07:06:25.628 --> 07:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
called osteogenesis in perfecta my bones
 
07:06:28.708 --> 07:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
break and Fracture easily I am unable to
 
07:06:32.030 --> 07:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
walk and I am also short in stature I
 
07:06:34.548 --> 07:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
value my Independence which includes
 
07:06:37.830 --> 07:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
driving my own van holding a job and
 
07:06:39.350 --> 07:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
being a part of my
 
07:06:42.150 --> 07:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
community however because of this
 
07:06:45.230 --> 07:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
because of my condition I rely on others
 
07:06:47.628 --> 07:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
for my personal day-to-day
 
07:06:50.750 --> 07:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
care there is a great deal of trust that
 
07:06:53.190 --> 07:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
comes in taking someone on to provide
 
07:06:55.910 --> 07:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
that day-to-day care unfortunately there
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
can be times when that trust is broken I
 
07:07:02.310 --> 07:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
myself was once a victim of serious
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse and an instance of
 
07:07:07.750 --> 07:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
unwanted physical contact at the hands
 
07:07:11.388 --> 07:07:11.398 align:start position:0%
of a living caregiver it was a traumatic
 
07:07:14.350 --> 07:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
painful and frightening ordeal for me
 
07:07:15.670 --> 07:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
and for my
 
07:07:19.030 --> 07:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
family as it stands right now even for
 
07:07:21.750 --> 07:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adults such as myself the
 
07:07:24.430 --> 07:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse can prove to be
 
07:07:26.990 --> 07:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
narrow because the nature of the abuse
 
07:07:29.750 --> 07:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
I've subjected to was primarily
 
07:07:32.388 --> 07:07:32.398 align:start position:0%
emotional I was successful in receiving
 
07:07:35.350 --> 07:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
only a temporary protective order
 
07:07:38.030 --> 07:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
against my former caregiver while my
 
07:07:39.910 --> 07:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
personal situation was ultimately
 
07:07:43.430 --> 07:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
resolved in a satisfactory manner I wish
 
07:07:45.350 --> 07:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
could have been I wish more could have
 
07:07:48.430 --> 07:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
been done at the beginning of my
 
07:07:50.910 --> 07:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
ordeal that is precisely where this bill
 
07:07:53.110 --> 07:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
comes into why for people with
 
07:07:55.468 --> 07:07:55.478 align:start position:0%
disabilities like myself as well as
 
07:07:59.110 --> 07:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
other vulnerable adults HB 246
 
07:08:01.430 --> 07:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
reasonably broadens the definition of
 
07:08:04.628 --> 07:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
abuse this will allow law to protect
 
07:08:08.230 --> 07:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
those individuals who cannot protect
 
07:08:11.388 --> 07:08:11.398 align:start position:0%
themselves with this in mind I hope the
 
07:08:13.628 --> 07:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
members of this committee will choose to
 
07:08:15.830 --> 07:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
support hb2
 
07:08:18.190 --> 07:08:18.200 align:start position:0%

07:08:21.070 --> 07:08:21.080 align:start position:0%

07:12:15.628 --> 07:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon um Mr chairman members of the
 
07:12:17.910 --> 07:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
07:12:21.070 --> 07:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
Alan Rice and I am a resident of Bedford
 
07:12:23.430 --> 07:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here today as the
 
07:12:25.708 --> 07:12:25.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state director of Gun
 
07:12:28.510 --> 07:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
Owners of America um we're a National
 
07:12:30.750 --> 07:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
Organization with close to two million
 
07:12:34.030 --> 07:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
individual members and we are opposed to
 
07:12:35.150 --> 07:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
07:12:38.468 --> 07:12:38.478 align:start position:0%
246 um earlier this morning I I emailed
 
07:12:41.150 --> 07:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
my uh pre-written testimony to the
 
07:12:43.590 --> 07:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee I hope you all received it um
 
07:12:46.628 --> 07:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to to use my time to touch
 
07:12:49.270 --> 07:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
on and rebut um some of the points that
 
07:12:52.030 --> 07:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor made as well as one
 
07:12:54.070 --> 07:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the other uh
 
07:12:58.110 --> 07:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um they are correct in that
 
07:13:00.830 --> 07:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 246 does not include the word
 
07:13:03.548 --> 07:13:03.558 align:start position:0%
firearm and it does not include the term
 
07:13:05.990 --> 07:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
confiscation um but it doesn't need to
 
07:13:07.270 --> 07:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
include those
 
07:13:10.868 --> 07:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
terms um the judge can order
 
07:13:15.190 --> 07:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
confiscation um page six on line three
 
07:13:18.628 --> 07:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me page six line three talks
 
07:13:21.788 --> 07:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
about it's not limited to what's in
 
07:13:24.190 --> 07:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill the judge can order
 
07:13:27.070 --> 07:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
anything they want um nothing prohibits
 
07:13:27.080 --> 07:13:28.230 align:start position:0%
anything they want um nothing prohibits
gun

07:13:28.230 --> 07:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
gun
 
07:13:30.628 --> 07:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
confiscation um it
 
07:13:33.270 --> 07:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically allowed but it's
 
07:13:35.430 --> 07:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
clearly not prohibited and we've seen
 
07:13:39.350 --> 07:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
judges um in domestic violence cases you
 
07:13:40.990 --> 07:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
know when there wasn't violence there
 
07:13:42.590 --> 07:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
was just some some
 
07:13:45.190 --> 07:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
verbalization um ordering all kinds of
 
07:13:47.948 --> 07:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
stuff um so to say this isn't a gun grab
 
07:13:51.030 --> 07:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
is is simply not correct um the the
 
07:13:53.948 --> 07:13:53.958 align:start position:0%
other reason this is a gun grab is
 
07:13:55.868 --> 07:13:55.878 align:start position:0%
because when you involve parents and
 
07:13:58.670 --> 07:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
children they fit fit the definition in
 
07:14:01.788 --> 07:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
both state and federal law of those
 
07:14:04.070 --> 07:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
protected under the domestic violence
 
07:14:07.270 --> 07:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and if a person becomes subject
 
07:14:10.788 --> 07:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
to a permanent order that is issued
 
07:14:12.230 --> 07:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
under house bill
 
07:14:15.388 --> 07:14:15.398 align:start position:0%
246 that permanent order would in fact
 
07:14:17.510 --> 07:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
trigger the federal domestic violence
 
07:14:21.548 --> 07:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
gun ban so this is a gun grab
 
07:14:23.510 --> 07:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
um even though the Ward's firearm have
 
07:14:26.670 --> 07:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
been removed from the bill um even
 
07:14:28.830 --> 07:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
though Miss Steinberg you know she
 
07:14:30.750 --> 07:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
sugarcoated it and she used a lot of
 
07:14:33.510 --> 07:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
fancy legal words to talk about it a
 
07:14:36.708 --> 07:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
telephonic hearing means no due process
 
07:14:39.750 --> 07:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
it means the judge only hears from one
 
07:14:42.310 --> 07:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
party and the other party who's being
 
07:14:46.030 --> 07:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
accused possibly falsely is not provided
 
07:14:48.070 --> 07:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity to address the court
 
07:14:50.590 --> 07:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
and say hey wait a second th this is
 
07:14:52.948 --> 07:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
what really going on and and this is why
 
07:14:56.070 --> 07:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't issue this order um we
 
07:14:59.310 --> 07:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
realize that there's um short period of
 
07:15:01.150 --> 07:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
time between the temporary order and a
 
07:15:03.590 --> 07:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
final order and an extra hearing but you
 
07:15:05.948 --> 07:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
know what we've seen these hearings get
 
07:15:07.910 --> 07:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
extended especially in the last year
 
07:15:12.030 --> 07:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
with with the China virus um all kind of
 
07:15:13.948 --> 07:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
excuses have been used not to convene
 
07:15:16.030 --> 07:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
courts not to have hearings now you have
 
07:15:18.548 --> 07:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
a person subject to a temporary hearing
 
07:15:20.788 --> 07:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
possibly losing their firearm sitting in
 
07:15:23.388 --> 07:15:23.398 align:start position:0%
in legal Mumbo legal
 
07:15:27.628 --> 07:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
limbo um they say this is needed I I I
 
07:15:31.670 --> 07:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
referenced some rsas in my testimony 631
 
07:15:36.230 --> 07:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
colon 8 n and 10 um those carry felony
 
07:15:36.240 --> 07:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
colon 8 n and 10 um those carry felony
penalties

07:15:37.910 --> 07:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
07:15:41.590 --> 07:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
for criminal neglect Financial
 
07:15:41.600 --> 07:15:44.510 align:start position:0%
for criminal neglect Financial
exploitation

07:15:44.510 --> 07:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
exploitation
 
07:15:47.708 --> 07:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
um both the elderly the disabled the
 
07:15:51.868 --> 07:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
impaired um they're B A and B felonies
 
07:15:54.430 --> 07:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at serious offenses in
 
07:15:57.990 --> 07:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
the current law and as we see this bill
 
07:16:00.990 --> 07:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
the the only reason really to push it is
 
07:16:04.548 --> 07:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
for another you know backdoor gun grab
 
07:16:06.430 --> 07:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
um I I had in my notes I wanted to
 
07:16:08.670 --> 07:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
address you know Miss Steinberg said you
 
07:16:11.590 --> 07:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
know the the parents deed the home to
 
07:16:13.270 --> 07:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
their children the children want to sell
 
07:16:15.590 --> 07:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
the home and the parents kicked out and
 
07:16:17.830 --> 07:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have any relief it it sounds
 
07:16:20.230 --> 07:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
horrible you know a senior citizen you
 
07:16:22.590 --> 07:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
know living out on the street and being
 
07:16:25.750 --> 07:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
homeless but is that a proper function
 
07:16:27.868 --> 07:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
of government to
 
07:16:30.910 --> 07:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
intervene when they deed the home now
 
07:16:32.590 --> 07:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
the child owns the home and they're
 
07:16:35.590 --> 07:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
selling their own property I'm not sure
 
07:16:38.510 --> 07:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's a crime and then I want to Circle
 
07:16:41.310 --> 07:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
back to when they get in order not to do
 
07:16:48.270 --> 07:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:51.230 --> 07:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
guns they talked about negotiation
 
07:16:52.750 --> 07:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know about other Firearms
 
07:16:55.750 --> 07:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
organizations but Gun Owners of America
 
07:16:57.350 --> 07:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
we've been very active in New Hampshire
 
07:17:00.110 --> 07:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
for many years we weren't invited to
 
07:17:02.788 --> 07:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
participate and it it looks to me
 
07:17:06.670 --> 07:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
like the negotiations were extremely
 
07:17:09.788 --> 07:17:09.798 align:start position:0%
one-sided um Miss Steinberg um obviously
 
07:17:12.548 --> 07:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
I mean she has a a role to play um
 
07:17:15.110 --> 07:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative Kush has been pushing
 
07:17:17.990 --> 07:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
this this similar language since 2018
 
07:17:20.830 --> 07:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
maybe even longer um he obviously had
 
07:17:22.868 --> 07:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
you know a legislative agenda um but we
 
07:17:25.030 --> 07:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
weren't invited you know to participate
 
07:17:27.230 --> 07:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
in those
 
07:17:30.670 --> 07:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations um and I I also want to
 
07:17:33.030 --> 07:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
bring up two points about the bill
 
07:17:35.350 --> 07:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's an indefinite look back in time
 
07:17:37.310 --> 07:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
so someone can allege something happened
 
07:17:39.628 --> 07:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
decades ago and the court can take it
 
07:17:41.948 --> 07:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
into consideration when issuing such an
 
07:17:46.070 --> 07:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
order um that's really dangerous um our
 
07:17:48.310 --> 07:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
criminal codes have statutes of
 
07:17:50.708 --> 07:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
limitations um in some cases for
 
07:17:52.310 --> 07:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors it's as little as like a
 
07:17:54.670 --> 07:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
year but this provides an indefinite
 
07:17:58.310 --> 07:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
look back um pretty much anyone can
 
07:17:59.868 --> 07:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
request such an
 
07:18:03.350 --> 07:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
order um and yes the defendant can
 
07:18:06.468 --> 07:18:06.478 align:start position:0%
demand a hearing at their own expense
 
07:18:08.830 --> 07:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
and our attorneys tell me such a hearing
 
07:18:11.030 --> 07:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
could run into the you know tens of
 
07:18:13.708 --> 07:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars um rather than
 
07:18:15.628 --> 07:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
going on and and taking up more of the
 
07:18:18.548 --> 07:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
committee's valuable time um I would ask
 
07:18:22.190 --> 07:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
you to vote house bill 46 inexpedient to
 
07:18:25.510 --> 07:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislate um our strongest points are in
 
07:18:28.030 --> 07:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
my written testimony um but I'm happy to
 
07:18:29.830 --> 07:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions uh that the
 
07:18:32.468 --> 07:18:32.478 align:start position:0%
members may have and I thank you any
 
07:18:49.430 --> 07:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:49.440 --> 07:18:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
rice

07:18:55.430 --> 07:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:19.430 --> 07:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:19.440 --> 07:19:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
Newman

07:19:25.110 --> 07:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:28.948 --> 07:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
I do not see Mr Newman thank
 
07:19:36.628 --> 07:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:39.510 --> 07:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
penik yes speaking now I'm Erin Pig I
 
07:19:43.270 --> 07:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
live in Hollis New Hampshire um I uh
 
07:19:46.788 --> 07:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
come here in opposition to House Bill
 
07:19:49.350 --> 07:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
246 for a variety of
 
07:19:51.910 --> 07:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I'm going to avoid redundancy in
 
07:19:54.150 --> 07:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
the interest of time right but there's
 
07:19:56.270 --> 07:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh there there is a significant La lack
 
07:19:58.830 --> 07:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
of specificity on what property could be
 
07:20:01.510 --> 07:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
seized in this bill which is part of the
 
07:20:03.788 --> 07:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
problem that the Firearms constituents
 
07:20:07.030 --> 07:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
are are bringing up it's specific on
 
07:20:10.468 --> 07:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
pets for example but it's not specific
 
07:20:13.590 --> 07:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
on what could be excluded from
 
07:20:16.670 --> 07:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
confiscation if uh an order was
 
07:20:21.110 --> 07:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
issued um it this this bill is
 
07:20:23.670 --> 07:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier I think by uh by
 
07:20:26.110 --> 07:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
Miss Steinberg this is the third or
 
07:20:28.430 --> 07:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
fourth time this bill has been
 
07:20:32.150 --> 07:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
surfaced and it's just a rewrite of what
 
07:20:35.830 --> 07:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
has been surfaced before uh it's export
 
07:20:39.468 --> 07:20:39.478 align:start position:0%
a no do process confiscation it violates
 
07:20:42.830 --> 07:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
the 1 fourth 10th and 14th Amendment of
 
07:20:45.030 --> 07:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
our constitution that's the US
 
07:20:47.670 --> 07:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution and also similar ones uh
 
07:20:50.430 --> 07:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire uh another problem
 
07:20:53.388 --> 07:20:53.398 align:start position:0%
have I read through the whole bill twice
 
07:20:56.830 --> 07:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
and it it def it it defines the subject
 
07:21:03.190 --> 07:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
of any uh in any issued order as a
 
07:21:05.510 --> 07:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
defendant that subject has not been
 
07:21:08.468 --> 07:21:08.478 align:start position:0%
accused of a crime or committed a crime
 
07:21:10.468 --> 07:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
so they're not a
 
07:21:13.628 --> 07:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
defendant right they're a subject of the
 
07:21:16.868 --> 07:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
court order and that that needs to be
 
07:21:20.868 --> 07:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
changed it's just it's just not the way
 
07:21:22.830 --> 07:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's written is just it's just so
 
07:21:26.270 --> 07:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
ambiguous that it's not valid a good law
 
07:21:30.270 --> 07:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be precise it needs to be
 
07:21:33.150 --> 07:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
enforcable this one is not the way it's
 
07:21:35.190 --> 07:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
l written and I know that we've been
 
07:21:37.510 --> 07:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
through several times with this this
 
07:21:40.150 --> 07:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
whole thing started with a Firearms
 
07:21:44.708 --> 07:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
confiscation um clause in it and yes I
 
07:21:47.910 --> 07:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
agree that the the there's no word
 
07:21:51.350 --> 07:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
firearms in this current vers of it
 
07:21:53.430 --> 07:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
right but it's morph now to the current
 
07:21:56.788 --> 07:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
version which is ambiguous in terms of
 
07:21:57.948 --> 07:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
what can be
 
07:22:00.468 --> 07:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
confiscated I think they either Veil
 
07:22:00.478 --> 07:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
confiscated I think they either Veil
that

07:22:01.270 --> 07:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:22:04.150 --> 07:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
threat right or it's just because of
 
07:22:07.230 --> 07:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
poor language in the bill but we should
 
07:22:09.350 --> 07:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
be more precise in that the citizens of
 
07:22:12.430 --> 07:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire deserve better than
 
07:22:15.868 --> 07:22:15.878 align:start position:0%
that you know I was taking notes here as
 
07:22:19.548 --> 07:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
Miss Steinberg was talking she said it's
 
07:22:22.350 --> 07:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
not EXP explicitly written in there well
 
07:22:24.868 --> 07:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
no it's not but that's the problem
 
07:22:26.868 --> 07:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the problem it's not
 
07:22:29.750 --> 07:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly written in there be explicit
 
07:22:31.430 --> 07:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
about what the property is that can be
 
07:22:33.990 --> 07:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
confiscated if one of these orders is
 
07:22:35.388 --> 07:22:35.398 align:start position:0%
issued against
 
07:22:37.670 --> 07:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
someone there's nothing in here about
 
07:22:40.990 --> 07:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
the condition of the property that is
 
07:22:43.708 --> 07:22:43.718 align:start position:0%
confiscated would be in once it is
 
07:22:46.190 --> 07:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
returned to you if it
 
07:22:49.308 --> 07:22:49.318 align:start position:0%
is so so so some people have a
 
07:22:54.388 --> 07:22:54.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:56.788 --> 07:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
invested sorry my phone is ringing in
 
07:22:58.990 --> 07:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
their firearms and other
 
07:23:02.750 --> 07:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
things uh and so so we don't want them
 
07:23:05.468 --> 07:23:05.478 align:start position:0%
to be returned as as trash because they
 
07:23:07.510 --> 07:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
were not stored
 
07:23:10.548 --> 07:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
properly uh it so so as it's written it
 
07:23:12.788 --> 07:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
does allow Firearms confiscation because
 
07:23:15.590 --> 07:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's ambiguous about what can be
 
07:23:19.510 --> 07:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
confiscated and what cannot uh I I think
 
07:23:22.868 --> 07:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of calling the person
 
07:23:22.878 --> 07:23:23.990 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of calling the person
a

07:23:23.990 --> 07:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:23:26.510 --> 07:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
defendant in the bill when they have not
 
07:23:29.110 --> 07:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
been accused of or charged with a crime
 
07:23:29.120 --> 07:23:31.308 align:start position:0%
been accused of or charged with a crime
is

07:23:31.308 --> 07:23:31.318 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:23:34.590 --> 07:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
wrong and I thank you Mr chairman for my
 
07:23:38.510 --> 07:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr penich for your
 
07:23:41.510 --> 07:23:41.520 align:start position:0%

who are signed up to testify will be
 
07:24:07.990 --> 07:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
given time to do so the one person
 
07:24:09.910 --> 07:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
remaining on my list is representative

remaining on my list is representative

because and I'm going to take my two

Hinsdale in a prior life I was an elder
 
07:24:59.478 --> 07:25:01.670 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale in a prior life I was an elder
law

07:25:01.670 --> 07:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:25:04.910 --> 07:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
attorney I started out doing Wills
 
07:25:09.830 --> 07:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
trusts and Estates and I progressed to
 
07:25:12.430 --> 07:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
what was then an emerging field of elder
 
07:25:14.548 --> 07:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
law when it suddenly occurred to
 
07:25:17.830 --> 07:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that our older citizens have
 
07:25:20.830 --> 07:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
problems that emerge particularly with
 
07:25:22.388 --> 07:25:22.398 align:start position:0%
respect to their property but other
 
07:25:25.070 --> 07:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
things as well before they're dead that
 
07:25:26.270 --> 07:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
07:25:29.350 --> 07:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
addressed and one of them is of
 
07:25:32.548 --> 07:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
elderly abuse and
 
07:25:37.270 --> 07:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
exploitation and I cannot tell you in my
 
07:25:40.750 --> 07:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
practice which was a long time ago how
 
07:25:44.590 --> 07:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
pervasive it is and what happens is
 
07:25:47.468 --> 07:25:47.478 align:start position:0%
somebody gains the trust of a failing
 
07:25:51.910 --> 07:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
Elder and they either convert all their
 
07:25:54.590 --> 07:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
property from the elders use to their
 
07:25:58.308 --> 07:25:58.318 align:start position:0%
own use so I had a case for example
 
07:26:01.708 --> 07:26:01.718 align:start position:0%
where an elderly lady with significant
 
07:26:03.990 --> 07:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
assets well over a million dollars which
 
07:26:04.000 --> 07:26:05.430 align:start position:0%
assets well over a million dollars which
in

07:26:05.430 --> 07:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:26:10.270 --> 07:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
1985 was a lot of money she gave her
 
07:26:13.190 --> 07:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
nephew a power of
 
07:26:16.708 --> 07:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
attorney and eventually the nursing home
 
07:26:19.110 --> 07:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
in which she resided filed with the
 
07:26:21.510 --> 07:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
court and said said we haven't been paid
 
07:26:25.270 --> 07:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
in a year can we get a guardianship of
 
07:26:28.190 --> 07:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
this lady and I as one of my very first
 
07:26:31.468 --> 07:26:31.478 align:start position:0%
um cases was appointed the
 
07:26:34.468 --> 07:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
guardian when I arrived on the
 
07:26:37.948 --> 07:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
scene the money was
 
07:26:41.628 --> 07:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
gone the woman was
 
07:26:46.788 --> 07:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:51.788 --> 07:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
unpaid had she not had one piece of real
 
07:26:54.628 --> 07:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
estate and had the nursing home not been
 
07:26:57.350 --> 07:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
willing to take a lean against
 
07:27:00.110 --> 07:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
that she would have become a charge on
 
07:27:02.510 --> 07:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
the state and all of us would have been
 
07:27:05.350 --> 07:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
paying for her nursing home
 
07:27:08.468 --> 07:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
bills had somebody been able to
 
07:27:11.750 --> 07:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
intervene at the beginning with a
 
07:27:15.788 --> 07:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
protective order that stopped the nephew
 
07:27:17.670 --> 07:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
from having the power of
 
07:27:20.590 --> 07:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
attorney and stopped stop him from
 
07:27:22.308 --> 07:27:22.318 align:start position:0%
draining her
 
07:27:26.430 --> 07:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
assets everybody including the lady and
 
07:27:29.510 --> 07:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
society would be in a better
 
07:27:32.990 --> 07:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
position Domestic Relations orders don't
 
07:27:35.708 --> 07:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
work that nephew was her nephew he was
 
07:27:38.110 --> 07:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
living in another state he was not
 
07:27:40.510 --> 07:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
covered by The Domestic Relations
 
07:27:43.190 --> 07:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
protective orders so there are a lot of
 
07:27:45.070 --> 07:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
cases where the Domestic Relations
 
07:27:47.830 --> 07:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
protective orders don't
 
07:27:52.270 --> 07:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:52.280 --> 07:27:53.868 align:start position:0%
 
guardianship

07:27:53.868 --> 07:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
07:27:53.878 --> 07:27:55.628 align:start position:0%
guardianship
statutes

07:27:55.628 --> 07:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
07:27:59.830 --> 07:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
take somewhere between 6 12 I don't know
 
07:28:02.948 --> 07:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
how many weeks to get a guardianship in
 
07:28:06.468 --> 07:28:06.478 align:start position:0%
place that is from my old experience so
 
07:28:08.150 --> 07:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
it may be a different amount of time in
 
07:28:10.190 --> 07:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but they're not easy you
 
07:28:12.868 --> 07:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
have to get an expert to testify that
 
07:28:16.468 --> 07:28:16.478 align:start position:0%
the Elder needs a guardian it's a long
 
07:28:19.270 --> 07:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
process and as you know assets can be
 
07:28:23.230 --> 07:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
taken during that process so the
 
07:28:25.708 --> 07:28:25.718 align:start position:0%
guardianship process doesn't help us
 
07:28:30.150 --> 07:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
here the criminal statutes can punish
 
07:28:34.430 --> 07:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
somebody for having done this deed but
 
07:28:37.110 --> 07:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
they don't make the Elder whole and they
 
07:28:41.388 --> 07:28:41.398 align:start position:0%
don't prevent either the financial abuse
 
07:28:44.548 --> 07:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
or the physical abuse or the emotional
 
07:28:49.270 --> 07:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
abuse from going on and on and on I mean
 
07:28:49.280 --> 07:28:50.708 align:start position:0%
abuse from going on and on and on I mean
if

07:28:50.708 --> 07:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
if
 
07:28:53.510 --> 07:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody getss arrested and they bail
 
07:28:55.990 --> 07:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
themselves out and they come back what
 
07:28:59.788 --> 07:28:59.798 align:start position:0%
what do you do these are cases in which
 
07:29:07.468 --> 07:29:07.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:10.910 --> 07:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
helpful I'm not going to go Point by
 
07:29:14.708 --> 07:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
Point by all the things that I think are
 
07:29:17.590 --> 07:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect about the testimony we've
 
07:29:20.030 --> 07:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
heard because it's late and you heard
 
07:29:22.590 --> 07:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
both sides a bit and I can talk about
 
07:29:24.990 --> 07:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
that in an executive
 
07:29:28.110 --> 07:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
session but what I ask you to consider
 
07:29:32.388 --> 07:29:32.398 align:start position:0%
from the bottom of my heart is why do
 
07:29:36.910 --> 07:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
our vulnerable adults not have at least
 
07:29:38.510 --> 07:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
as much
 
07:29:42.510 --> 07:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
protection as the people who are abusing
 
07:29:46.230 --> 07:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
them that is the purpose of this
 
07:29:50.868 --> 07:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislation and if the law s on one side
 
07:29:50.878 --> 07:29:51.750 align:start position:0%
legislation and if the law s on one side
or

07:29:51.750 --> 07:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:29:55.190 --> 07:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
another I would hope that the law
 
07:30:00.230 --> 07:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
s on the side
 
07:30:04.628 --> 07:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
of protecting the vulnerable adult and
 
07:30:06.830 --> 07:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
possibly overstepping on the rights of
 
07:30:06.840 --> 07:30:08.430 align:start position:0%
possibly overstepping on the rights of
their

07:30:08.430 --> 07:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
07:30:11.468 --> 07:30:11.478 align:start position:0%
abuser um and with that I end my
 
07:30:13.670 --> 07:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will take no questions
 
07:30:15.510 --> 07:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
