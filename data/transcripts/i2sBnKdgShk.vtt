00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.390 align:start position:0%
month on July 4th so there is that issue
and<00:25:49.140><c> there's</c><00:25:49.320><c> been</c><00:25:49.500><c> some</c><00:25:49.740><c> testimonies</c>

the<00:25:52.919><c> reason</c><00:25:53.039><c> why</c><00:25:53.279><c> this</c><00:25:53.460><c> isn't</c><00:25:53.760><c> on</c><00:25:53.940><c> consent</c><00:25:54.419><c> so</c>

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
the reason why this isn't on consent so
 

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.690 align:start position:0%
the reason why this isn't on consent so
I<00:25:55.260><c> thought</c><00:25:55.380><c> what</c><00:25:55.559><c> I</c><00:25:55.679><c> would</c><00:25:55.799><c> do</c><00:25:55.980><c> is</c><00:25:56.159><c> kind</c><00:25:56.400><c> of</c><00:25:56.520><c> go</c>

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
I thought what I would do is kind of go
 

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.450 align:start position:0%
I thought what I would do is kind of go
through<00:25:57.200><c> each</c><00:25:58.200><c> of</c><00:25:58.320><c> the</c><00:25:58.500><c> comments</c><00:25:59.039><c> that</c><00:25:59.279><c> were</c>

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
submitted as testimony if that's okay
 

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.669 align:start position:0%
submitted as testimony if that's okay
and<00:26:03.179><c> then</c><00:26:03.299><c> we</c><00:26:03.539><c> could</c><00:26:03.720><c> have</c><00:26:04.140><c> the</c><00:26:04.380><c> agency</c>

00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
and then we could have the agency
 

00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:05.870 align:start position:0%
and then we could have the agency
address<00:26:04.980><c> them</c>

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%

took a look at this alongside of the

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
a bit more clear I do see there is a
 

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.049 align:start position:0%
a bit more clear I do see there is a

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.710 align:start position:0%
objectives of the statute
um<00:27:16.860><c> I</c><00:27:17.100><c> think</c><00:27:17.220><c> that</c><00:27:17.460><c> that's</c><00:27:17.820><c> probably</c><00:27:18.299><c> going</c><00:27:18.539><c> to</c>

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's probably going to
 

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.289 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's probably going to
be<00:27:18.779><c> a</c><00:27:19.020><c> policy</c><00:27:19.380><c> decision</c><00:27:19.799><c> and</c><00:27:20.460><c> as</c><00:27:20.640><c> time</c><00:27:20.880><c> goes</c><00:27:21.179><c> on</c>

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
be a policy decision and as time goes on
 

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:24.110 align:start position:0%
be a policy decision and as time goes on
the<00:27:21.539><c> agency</c><00:27:21.840><c> will</c><00:27:22.260><c> probably</c><00:27:22.440><c> have</c><00:27:22.919><c> more</c><00:27:23.340><c> to</c>

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
the agency will probably have more to
 

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
the agency will probably have more to
you<00:27:24.480><c> know</c><00:27:24.539><c> that</c><00:27:25.140><c> it</c><00:27:25.320><c> could</c><00:27:25.440><c> do</c><00:27:25.620><c> more</c><00:27:25.799><c> and</c><00:27:26.100><c> amend</c>

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know that it could do more and amend
 

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
you know that it could do more and amend

00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
everything that they have to prove so I

here<00:28:09.740><c> everything</c><00:28:10.940><c> would</c><00:28:11.940><c> be</c><00:28:12.120><c> really</c><00:28:12.360><c> in</c><00:28:12.600><c> the</c>

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
here everything would be really in the
