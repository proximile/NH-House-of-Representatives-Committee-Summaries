all right that clears out a lot of the
 
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.210 align:start position:0%
all right that clears out a lot of the
uh

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
simple stuff
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
and so we start with the Board of
 
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.610 align:start position:0%
and so we start with the Board of
Medicine

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me the Board of Education
 
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
yes uh so the Board of Education uh
 
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 align:start position:0%
final proposal
 
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
2023-31 on the procedures for approval
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
of for professional educator preparation
 
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.309 align:start position:0%
of for professional educator preparation
programs

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
um this one did have a conditional
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
approval request filed with our office
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
and it did address the majority of the
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
comments the only remaining substantive
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
comments are there is one on page two of
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
the rule text it's an unclear comment
 
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
due to the wording of the sentence
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
and the comment did propose some
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
language that would clarify the
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
requirements in order to make that
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
sentence clear so if the board was
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
willing to change that that would take
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
care of that comment and the other one
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
is just an informational note to the
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
committee this proposal
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
got rid of
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
um repealed quite a number of sections
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
because there were redundant
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
requirements in these uh 600s and the
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
500 so a lot of the language was
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
repealed and the other proposal that is
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
renumbering the 500s is actually just
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
approved on the consent agenda 2023-22
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
so the citations that are in this
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
proposal reflect that renumbering in
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
good morning Steve Appleby Auburn New
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire director at Department of
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
Education we would take the suggestion
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
or the State Board would take the
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion made by OLS regarding the
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
wording and file a conditional approval
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
for for conditional approval I apologize
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
so what could happen is the committee
 
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.250 align:start position:0%
so what could happen is the committee
could

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.630 align:start position:0%
could
um

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
approve conditionally approve this based
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the conditional approval that was
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
filed and then
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
additionally with that change
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'll make that in motion
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay seconded by Senator Ennis
 
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
and discussion
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much and uh
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
that was simple
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
then the board of Engineers
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
2023-44 ethical standards and license
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
surrender engineer 500s
 
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.530 align:start position:0%
surrender engineer 500s
um

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing anybody from the oplc
 
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.190 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing anybody from the oplc
here

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
um a conditional approval has been filed
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
there is one unclear editorial on page
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
four that really could be addressed at
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
adoption however the main issue with the
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
proposal is that the rules have been
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
expired since January of 2022 and so the
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee may have some questions about
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement of ethical standards
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
there is a statute that does require
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
Engineers to be of good professional
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
character and that's RSA 310 a13
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
so the board does have that statute to
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
enforce but without any rules in place
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's not clear what good professional
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
character will mean and how they'll
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
enforce that but I'm not seeing anybody
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
from the oplc here yeah is there anyone
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
from the agency
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't see anybody either okay we have
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
a question on how they enforce the
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
expired rules
 
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.870 align:start position:0%
expired rules
um

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.220 align:start position:0%
if I could the um the other proposal
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
2023-116 is continued status for
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
engineers so that one's been postponed
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
you could postpone this item as well and
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
no all right
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
does the committee have a any position
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.829 align:start position:0%
on this
no

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I move we
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
postponed this one also and deal with it
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
since that will be before our our
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
deadline anyway seconds
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
those in favor I opposed
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
okay we will uh find out what they're
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
what the engineers are doing
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually you will need a waiver for that
 
00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
one I'm sorry to postpone it
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
is the meeting is on September 21st and
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
um the deadline's the 19th sorry all
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
right then yes we will ask for and
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
change the motion to include asking for
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
I made my section as well okay
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
thank you and more ethical standards
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
with the soil scientists
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
so this proposal has the same issues as
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
was just discussed these rules have been
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
expired since March 18 2019
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
there is a statute that does list some
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
violations that may be
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
considered as ethical standards such as
 
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
any person who gives false or Forge
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
evidence to a board in obtaining
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
certificate would be a violation however
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other ethical
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
standards that are not encompassed in
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
that statute that are in the rules
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
and also there was a conditional
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
approval request filed with this
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
proposal which addressed all the other
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
issues so that was the only remaining
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
issue with this but once again it
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem as there's anyone from oplc
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I take it the next one from the real
 
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.490 align:start position:0%
and I take it the next one from the real
estate

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
estate
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
appraiser board also has the same issues
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay we've
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes if the committee West we
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
could wait to take action until further
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the meeting if they show up
 
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.930 align:start position:0%
in the meeting if they show up
what

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
we will do that on both of them because
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
I want to find out what they're doing
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
with not and with their with expired
 
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.230 align:start position:0%
with not and with their with expired
rules

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
all right well so we'll skip over the
 
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.420 align:start position:0%
real estate appraiser board
 
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
real estate appraiser board
and

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
so the professional geologist there was
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval request filed
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
however there is still some issues
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the rule
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
um specifically there's an unclear
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
comment on page one of the rule text
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
excuse me the conditional approval rule
 
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.810 align:start position:0%
excuse me the conditional approval rule
text

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
text
 
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.569 align:start position:0%
text
um

00:14:10.569 --> 00:14:10.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
that is oh and I apologize I'm going to
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
back up a little bit there were a number
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
of comments on this one because we still
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
did not have a form submitted for this
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
particular proposal however a form was
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
submitted so a number of my comments on
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request have
 
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.829 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request have
been

00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:28.670 align:start position:0%
been
um

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
fixed due to that having that form so
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
the only remain new comment that I have
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
is um that the rule itself does not have
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
the title of the form in it it's simply
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
sites to the PLC 308.06 rule which is
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that Universal
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
application for license renewal form
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
however that specific rule does not have
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
the title in it either so with regard to
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
these geologist rules
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
the title should really be in there in
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
order to make it clear which form is
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
actually being discussed it sounds to me
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
as though that could be a
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
conditional approval that could be fixed
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
fine so does someone wish to make a
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
motion to conditionally approve these
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
provided they add in the title of the
 
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.610 align:start position:0%
provided they add in the title of the
form

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.129 align:start position:0%
form
okay

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's moved by Senator chandley second by
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:37.430 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye opposed

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
all right and I apologize this has
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the vote the
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee just took but I just also want
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
to make the committee aware that on this
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
proposal and a number of other proposals
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
that are going to be coming forward from
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
the professional boards we have been
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
making informational notes to jail car
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
about the fee issue just to keep that on
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
your radar and to also track which
 
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:01.940 align:start position:0%
boards are citing to those particular
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
PLC rules okay
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of information about
 
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:08.569 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of information about
those

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes the Department of
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is here if you
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
want to skip ahead to their room
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's item m
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
M good point because I don't see anybody
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
from agriculture
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
unless there is
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
no in that case let's skip ahead to the
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
it's out to the agriculture rule may
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
take some discussion
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
all right so this is final proposal
 
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
2023-136 the alteration of terrain there
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
was a conditional approval request file
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
that did address a majority of our
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
comments the only remaining comments on
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
this um proposal is there is an unclear
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
comment on page 18 of the conditional
 
00:16:58.930 --> 00:16:58.940 align:start position:0%
approval request text
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
there were a number of forms submitted
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
with this particular Rule and one of
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
them the amendment request form cites in
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
the certification in just one section
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
RSA 641 with regard to
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties that may come
 
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:20.990 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties that may come
from

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.449 align:start position:0%
from
not

00:17:22.449 --> 00:17:22.459 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
signing falsely or misrepresenting any
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
information in the application instead
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
of the specific citation RSA 6413 and
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
this is important because RSA 641 1 is
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
specifically for penalties of perjury
 
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.289 align:start position:0%
specifically for penalties of perjury
which

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
cannot be a criminal penalty unless it
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
is statutorily in the it's statutorily
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
authorized to be under the rules
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
so that comment was made on a couple
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
other places on this proposal but were
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
fixed so it seems this one was just an
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
oversight and in talking with the
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
Department it seems they are willing to
 
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:04.100 align:start position:0%
fix that which can be done
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
at adoption or in addition to the
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
condition uh conditional approval
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
request the other unclear comment is on
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
page 46 with regard to the appendix
 
00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
page 46 with regard to the appendix
um

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
we have been informed that department
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
has a new staff member working on
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and as the
 
00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740 align:start position:0%
committee is probably aware
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules is a very steep
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
learning curve to get into so we are
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
working with the staff member in order
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
to make the appendix more clear as this
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
was not the only proposal this issue had
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
come up on and we have been told by the
 
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
department that the appendix will be
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
fixed at the adoption stage for this
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
particular proposal and moving forward
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
will be fixed
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh finally there was a note to jail car
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
on page 12 once again regarding that RSA
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
641 issue the reason this is a note is
 
00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.770 align:start position:0%
641 issue the reason this is a note is
because

00:18:59.770 --> 00:18:59.780 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:04.039 align:start position:0%
these rules cite specifically to Environ
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
Envy WQ
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
150310 which is not in this proposal but
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
that rule also broadly cites RSA 641 so
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
that is just something the committee
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
needs to be aware of and potentially the
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Courtney Lockwood here
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
Services and I am the new staff member
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
that she's referring to so yes we'll
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
make those Corrections
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
I am impressed that you managed to get
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
the alteration of terrain rules through
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
without significant public comment so
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'll congratulate you for that
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
move by Sandra during a second by
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt is there any
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
aye those opposed
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if anybody from
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
agriculture is here
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so this proposal is adopting a single
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
section in the chapter 700 rules which
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
have been expired since 2009
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
um just to be clear it is only one
 
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
section in a chapter the chapter 700
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
that has been expired since 2009. the
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
rest of the chapter is also expired yes
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
the title of the chapter well it's on
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of agricultural land
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
development rights
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and yes that entire chapter has been
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
expired since then so this proposal is
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
just adopting one section
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and you know the section doesn't live
 
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:start position:0%
in isolation there are other
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
requirements in the chapter 700 rules
 
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:09.500 align:start position:0%
that should apply when evaluating land
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
for example the expired section just
 
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:13.580 align:start position:0%
before this one
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
705.01 is about the evaluation of
 
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:18.710 align:start position:0%
705.01 is about the evaluation of
applications

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.909 align:start position:0%
applications
um

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
just yeah it's the entire yeah sorry for
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know the agency hasn't brought
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
forward any other sections other than
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so the committee may have some
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
um besides the expiration issue the
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
proposal cites a form but the agency
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't submitted any form to be reviewed
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
and just a reminder there is a statutory
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
change that does require the submission
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
of forms with a final proposal but that
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
isn't effective yet
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
so like I said the form hasn't been
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
submitted and so the committee is being
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
asked to approve a form that hasn't been
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed at all
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
there's one other issue and you'll see
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
that on the top of the page page five of
 
00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:07.010 align:start position:0%
that on the top of the page page five of
the

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
of the packet and that's just around
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
what's an unclear around what does
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
potential and suitability mean if they
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
had a definition section then they could
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
probably Define this but they don't
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
so those are the main issues with it
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
there is also a node just you know as an
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
FYI to the committee that representative
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
Peter Bixby has submitted an email
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
stating that from his opinion that the
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
rules do meet legislative intent so I'm
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that but beyond that you
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
know it does have the the issue of the
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
entire chapter being expired and these
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
being expired since 2009. yes all right
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone from the Department
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
nope okay
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're any any comments from the
 
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.210 align:start position:0%
we're any any comments from the
committee

00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that they meet the legislative
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
intent but I'm seriously worried about
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
something that's been expired for 14
 
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.330 align:start position:0%
something that's been expired for 14
years

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's a very long time and the rest of
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
the chapter is still expired and it
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to us that they've started
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
to work on it
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
no I've not seen any proposals come
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
forward for it Madam chair yes I I would
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
say that for I think three months
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
the department does have a person
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated to rulemaking I think she is
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
part-time but and it's going to take
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
some time because they have
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage of rules that are
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes I think it's also
 
00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:57.539 align:start position:0%
concerning that the form they're asking
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
us to approve has not been presented and
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
you know I'm wondering
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
you know where does that put us you know
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
as a community well we have a couple of
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
options we can ask for a waiver and
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
postpone it we can approve it site on
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
scene which I'm not going to vote for me
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
neither and or we can oppose the rule
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
on the make it put in a preliminary
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
objection on the grounds that we don't
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
know what's been going on since 2009 and
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's no forms
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
so do you care to make a motion
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
the last one okay Senator Ward moves the
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
preliminary object to the rule
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Schmidt
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
those in favor I opposed
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I would like to thanks
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for checking the
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
new laws and approving making sure the
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
rule is in the in accordance with it
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay and I will convey your remarks to
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby who's a fellow
 
00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:24.059 align:start position:0%
Dover rep okay a good friend of mine so
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
all right Broadband matching Grant
 
00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:31.250 align:start position:0%
all right Broadband matching Grant
initiative

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so they have filed a conditional
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
approval request and I don't have any
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
comments on this one because this um the
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request really did
 
00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
resolve all the comments that I had
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
however the interim rules expired last
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
month on July 4th so there is that issue
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
and there's been some testimonies
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
submitted on the proposal and so that's
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
the reason why this isn't on consent so
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
I thought what I would do is kind of go
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
through each of the comments that were
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
submitted as testimony if that's okay
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
and then we could have the agency
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
address them
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
looks like someone is here so the first
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
comment you'll see is on page one of the
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and that is
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
around the expiration of the rule down
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page there is a
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
comment testimony was submitted that the
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
definitions for underserved locations
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
and unserved locations and over build
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
could be a bit more detailed and that
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
there was some overlap between
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
underserved and unserved definitions I
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
took a look at this alongside of the
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
statute and I thought that the
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
definitions were you know in line with
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the statute whether or not they could be
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
a bit more clear I do see there is a
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
little bit of overlap between the two
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
but um so that was one issue the next
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
one is on page four of the conditional
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
approval request at the top of the page
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
and the testimony here was a really
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
around the scoring criteria they thought
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the scoring could be more detailed
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
to address how the agency will determine
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
whether or not the project will deploy
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
faster service or otherwise meet the
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
objectives of the statute
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's probably going to
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
be a policy decision and as time goes on
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
the agency will probably have more to
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know that it could do more and amend
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
the rules here to um around the scoring
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
issue they'll probably have more detail
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
to add later
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
um the next one is on the very next page
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
and here this is on the challenge
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
um this talks about that the challenging
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
party shall provide detailed proof that
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
the application is in violation of the
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
statute and the testimony really wanted
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a definition or to
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
explain what this detailed proof would
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
be and it to me it seems like the
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
Challenger should should really submit
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
everything that they have to prove so I
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
don't know necessarily the outlining
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
here everything would be really in the
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
best interest of the Challenger or the
 
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:18.020 align:start position:0%
agency so I didn't place a comment
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
detail proof could be defined they could
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
put an example here if you if if that's
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
something that you think they should do
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
but um so that was that comment and
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's one more on the next page this
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
is the last one it's on page six and
 
00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:36.539 align:start position:0%
here this is about
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
um well it says failure to provide
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
timely reporting to the agency will
 
00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:42.860 align:start position:0%
result in non-compliance of the contract
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
and testimony wanted something in the
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
rule stating that there should be notice
 
00:28:50.409 --> 00:28:50.419 align:start position:0%
and opportunity for a cure
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
I believe that that's most likely going
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
to be in the contract that the GNC
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
approve they could put it here in the
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
rule they may not need it but but they
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
might so those are the issues with the
 
00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
might so those are the issues with the
rule

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
motions

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
motions
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
I will say I I called representative
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
leishman who worked on the legislation
 
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
creating these grants and was unable to
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
actually speak to him
 
00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.669 align:start position:0%
actually speak to him
so

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have any update on the
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
Michael was just about decision director
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
moral you had a comment
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
um regarding the wish to have notice and
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for a hearing in other
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
settings that would be perfectly
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate and would be required by law
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
but if this is done pursuant to a
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
contract it would be entirely dependent
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
upon what the contract says
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
yes yes I agree that that's that sort of
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
detail is more appropriately covered in
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
all right do you have a motion senator
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay Senator and this moves to approve
 
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:25.940 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay second by Senator Ward
 
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.769 align:start position:0%
all in favor
opposed

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for us for
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
showing up
 
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
showing up
laughs

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
all right any other uh
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
I believe the only other business is an
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
emergency rule that we can um
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
we should be discussing correct yes but
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
we still do have some of the uh
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
boards uh rules that the committee
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
hasn't dealt with yet either to postpone
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
or to go ahead and take it haven't they
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
been postponed
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
not all of them I think for example 49
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
from natural scientists right
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
and 50. I believe we skipped 49 and 50.
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
that's G and H
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
please let's postpone them 49 and 50.
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
we'll need a waiver for 50. okay I move
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
we postpone
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
to our next meeting and ask for a waiver
 
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.730 align:start position:0%
to our next meeting and ask for a waiver
second

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.010 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye opposed

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
all right and uh we will remind the oplc
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair there's also
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the objection response for 20 23.89
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
on the agenda but I just wanted to let
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
the committee know we have not yet
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
received that response they did get a
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
waiver to extend their deadline to
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
August 31st so they still have a little
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
more time to submit that okay well
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable if we haven't got it
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
we don't need to talk about it
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
so the emergency rule the emergency rule
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%
um is from oplc it's for The Advisory
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
Board of Respiratory Care practitioners
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
on May 23rd a regular rule went into
 
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.409 align:start position:0%
on May 23rd a regular rule went into
effect

00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:32.419 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
regarding continuing education it was
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
doubling the hours for continuing
 
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
education for Respiratory Care
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners Within
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
two to three weeks the agency had to
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing because they had a
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
lot of negative feedback from
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
licensees and in fact they had a couple
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
of dozen licensees show up at the
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
meeting saying that this was going to be
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
very difficult because they had did not
 
00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:02.779 align:start position:0%
have notice of this
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
change until it went into effect while
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
they may have been legal notice
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
apparently a lot of licensees didn't
 
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:12.380 align:start position:0%
realize it
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
expiration of the licenses is is at the
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
end of this year so they would only have
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
eight months to complete all the the new
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
doubled requirements
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
the emergency rule specified several
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
reasons why this was going to be
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
problematic for licensees there's a
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
desperate shortage of them right now so
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for the
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners to take time off to do the
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
continuing ad which is routinely during
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
the daytime there were a couple of other
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
reasons and oplc said that this was
 
00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:51.980 align:start position:0%
not only a safety issue because
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
they were going to have to take time off
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
to do this it was going to be a shortage
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
also financial burden on the
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
Respiratory Care practitioners
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
themselves by doing the extra they did
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
indicate too that National associations
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
were in favor of the lower limits and
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
the lower limits were pretty much
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
standardized in other jurisdictions
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
so the emergency
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
backed off from their increased uh
 
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
exactly yes
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
well it's nice to know that I heard from
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
a couple of respiratory therapists who
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
were concerned that the CEO had had
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
suddenly doubled so it's nice to know
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
they were listening to the people
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
involved and I'm not sure where they got
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
the idea that they needed a whole lot
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
more continuing education I I don't know
 
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.349 align:start position:0%
more continuing education I I don't know
technically

00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
technically
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
an emergency rule is not completely
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
necessary because there is probably time
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
for oplc to go through regular
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
rulemaking before uh the the licenses
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
expire at the end of the year but that
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
sort of leaves the practitioners in
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
limbo you know if the rule doesn't go
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
into effect then suddenly they have to
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
have 24 hours instead of 12 hours
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
yes and we could always petition
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
we could petition to withdraw the
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
emergency room it sounds like the
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
emergency rule is more sensible than the
 
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
rule it's withdrawing so
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to take any action
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay unless you do do you think they
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
need 12 hours no no I I just think it's
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
kind of a bizarre situation it is
 
00:35:42.609 --> 00:35:42.619 align:start position:0%
bizarre and what worries me is that the
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
rule change was not
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
noticed by the licensees sure any
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
questionably noticed yeah well then a
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of them came back out and said hey
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
we never heard about this which
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
apparently is what happened I think we
 
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
apparently is what happened I think we
ought to

00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is request oplc to check
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
into its notification procedures because
 
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:08.780 align:start position:0%
they should have been note been notified
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
historically a 541a required
 
00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:13.190 align:start position:0%
historically a 541a required
um

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
where the uh there was rules regarding
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
licensees that there be personal notice
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
of every single licensee of course this
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
became burdensome because sending out
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
mail to say with the Board of Nursing
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
when you've got tens of thousands of
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
licensees of course that was before
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
really email was available and certainly
 
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
they must have a list of licensees and
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
they could use email at this point I I
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
would think so and perhaps we should
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
consider reinstating that requirement
 
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.470 align:start position:0%
consider reinstating that requirement
because

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
I mean this is clearly a failure to
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
communicate and it's something that if
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
it weren't something that it sounded
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
like the board was stretching to impose
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
on the licensees it could have been
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
something much more urgent
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
they did use the legal mechanism of
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
publishing in the register but that
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't always get to individual's
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
effects right exactly
 
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.930 align:start position:0%
effects right exactly
okay

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.370 align:start position:0%
okay
okay oops

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
okay oops
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
all right then do we have any other
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
business uh just whether or not you want
 
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.089 align:start position:0%
business uh just whether or not you want
to

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:22.099 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
eliminate the continued meeting yes I
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
would notice that there's a need for it
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
right I would note that we've postponed
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
about eight or nine rules today and
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
we've already received
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
12 final proposals for next month and we
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
have two weeks to go uh uh so do you
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
think we should have the continued
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and just for the postponed rules
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
we could do that it would help eliminate
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
a huge crush I think at the next meeting
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
but it's up to the committee okay how
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
about do you could you guys show up for
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
another meeting to get rid through all
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
the oplc stuff right
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
I believe that's two weeks from today
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
which is the 30th 30th okay the 31st I
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
since we have questions on all of them
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing on their uh
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
expired rules
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
doodly noted well perhaps a little
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang why
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
we have several yeah I think I think we
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
should we should plan on that one just
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
because we've postponed a significant
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
block of specifically oplc rules the
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
alternative would be to have a continued
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
meeting in September uh depending how
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
many final proposals we do have in
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
September and how many the committee can
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
get through I think that since we've got
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
a nice block of them off of the same
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
agency with mostly the same issues we
 
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
should just do it and get it over with
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.790 align:start position:0%
and uh
yes

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully the all of the new proposals
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
will be on consent one never knows
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
okay committee has does not have to take
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
any action because the meeting is
 
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
any action because the meeting is
scheduled

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
are adjourned and we'll see you on the
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.329 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
okay
so
