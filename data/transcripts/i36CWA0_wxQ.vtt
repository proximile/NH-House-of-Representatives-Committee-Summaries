it's it's helpful for us to hear what

you think might be important or might
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%

in the county
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
there were sign sheets and there should
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
be one out front for you to sign up if
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
you'd like to speak
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
it just helps us organize the meeting a
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
little more and we have a microphone up
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
here for you to speak to and since we're

well we all know the goal of
redistricting

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
is to ensure equal representation of
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
people in each district
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
when that population shifts but
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
obviously we know for centuries
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
to govern in 1812
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
that redistricting has been a vehicle
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
for partisan gerrymandering in order to
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
strengthen the political grip of the
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
body of power at any other moment
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
of democracy
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
but use computer power and big data has
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
allowed ever more powerful journeys
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
so we all know the eagles are journey

of our political divide

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
constitutionally the legislature has to
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
prove that no matter what method is used
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%

the low probability of gerrymandering

and the match you develop
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to do a lot to restore the

faith of the voters in our political

if they instead demonstrate your high

bottom line
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
is for the redistricting maps to be
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
responsive to the role of people
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
so they can elect whom they wish
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
because it's time to let the voters keep

their candidates

in each county

however the community must follow up

these listening sessions with four

first the special redistricting
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee should immediately disclose
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%

to the public

each citizen deserves an opportunity to

see the maps
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
many of them care deeply about your
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
district and wanted to be here tonight
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
they deserve a chance to both hear
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
information and give testimony directly
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
to this
committee

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
remote access would provide them with
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
this opportunity
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
finally i want to urge you to
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
incorporate the population data with
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
communities of interest data
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
this spring nonpartisan groups such as
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
the league of women voters and open
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
democracy gathered people from around
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
the state from participating the
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
mapathon citizen mapping project
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
i was one of the citizens who
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
participated in this project by filling
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
out information about the town that i
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
live in hamler
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
the data was then meticulously compiled
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
and mapped strong using both population
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
numbers and communities of interest data
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
i've looked at these maps and believe
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
they present fair non-partisan and
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
balanced solutions to redistricting
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
please consider using these maps when
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
making decisions and thank you again for
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
all your hard work
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
evening i want to also thank you very
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to participate
 
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to participate
in

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
a crucial process to share
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
our ideas about what it is going to take
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
to get fair and
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
for leaderships for the sake of new
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm gabrielle watson i'm from
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
the town of tamworth
 
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.430 align:start position:0%
the town of tamworth
um

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
where a rural community likes a rural
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
community that looks north to the mexico
 
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.790 align:start position:0%
community that looks north to the mexico
and

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're connected to a number of the
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
communities around us through
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
common interests like farmers markets
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
and fairs
 
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.670 align:start position:0%
and fairs
and

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
activities that come in
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm very worried
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
that our country and our communities are
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
being divided and stood apart
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
and so this process is crucial to help
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
us assure that we have non-partisan and
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
fair districts that everybody can trust
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
and have confidence in
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
to secure our sense of confidence in our
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
democracy in general
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see and what i
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
think this means is that we need to
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
understand the criteria that you're
 
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.589 align:start position:0%
understand the criteria that you're
using

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
and to have a clear and transparent
 
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.750 align:start position:0%
and to have a clear and transparent
process

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
to understand how you're drawing the
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
maps and have an opportunity
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
to see them
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to keep our
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
school districts together and public
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
health regions together these are some
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the communities of interest
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we identified during this process
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
of citizen-led and citizen-oriented
 
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
of citizen-led and citizen-oriented
mapping

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
mapping
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
um that ellen was just describing
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
and keeping the districts compact so
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
that the people who live and are
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
represented by
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
their representatives
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
share cultural resources share interests
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
in common can know each other and live
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
close to each other so they go to the
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
same medical facilities
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um all of this helps us collaborate
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
around regional initiatives like montana
 
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.170 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:48.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
so those sprawling you know districts
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
that go from one side of the state to
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
the other obviously
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
communities in the far ends of those
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
districts have nothing in common with
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
each other other than having a shared
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
right center who may not be listening to
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
all of the members of your district
 
00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:07.030 align:start position:0%
all of the members of your district
people

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
um very specifically in tamworth
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
we share a lot of bonds with the
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
community of sandwich and so that's
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's an interest that i would like to
 
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.430 align:start position:0%
that's an interest that i would like to
express

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
express
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
i know it's complicated because you're
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
needing to follow a lot of
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
rules about numbers and um
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know compactness and
 
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.349 align:start position:0%
you know compactness and
being

00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
contiguous with other communities but
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that for us in
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
particular professorship so much between
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
our two communities and also with
 
00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:38.390 align:start position:0%
our two communities and also with
madison

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
madison
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
those are some that's one thing in
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
particular i'm interested in and then
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
finally the last thing that i wanted to
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
speak to today is
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
is really the importance that people
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
need to have a chance to have a safe and
 
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
need to have a chance to have a safe and
fair

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful to have a listening
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
session and to listen ahead of time
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
before you develop the maps
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
but we need to see those maps that we
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
that might make them
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
more representative and more
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
responsive to the interests that we
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
share as communities
 
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.589 align:start position:0%
share as communities
um

00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
so while the listening session is great
 
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.670 align:start position:0%
so while the listening session is great
and

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
despite not having a zoom which you
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
would think after 18 months you would
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
have been able to figure out how to have
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
some participation in a public
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
consultation process but um
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
um i do think that we need to know or i
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
guess the question that i have is when
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
will we see the draft maps and when will
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
we see the criteria that you're using to
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
draw those maps so that we can
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
understand your thinking behind the maps
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
um and when um
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
will you be taking public comments on
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
those maps and how much time will we
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
have to make comments on those maps
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
before they're voted on it seems as
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
though we would need at least two weeks
 
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.069 align:start position:0%
though we would need at least two weeks
before

00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
they're finalized and they're voted on
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
in order to have any kind of meaningful
 
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.670 align:start position:0%
in order to have any kind of meaningful
input

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
into the substance of what you've
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
developed through their hard
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
work um
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
so i would like to urge you to commit to
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
having another round of public
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
appearance after their acts are released
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
and before they're voted on
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
and potentially consider if it's not
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
feasible to have the zoom interaction in
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
all of the public
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
um hearings than to have a standalone
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
session for all of those people we have
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
a number of people who are
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
compromised medically you weren't able
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
to be here tonight but who've been
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
participating with us in our preparation
 
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.069 align:start position:0%
participating with us in our preparation
for

00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
thinking about what we wanted to say
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
tonight so i urge you to consider at
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
least having this participation option
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
for those people
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
also signed up to
 
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
allowing us to
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
express our opinions uh
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
as members of the redistricting board
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
you must decide who you're going to
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.070 align:start position:0%

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the balanced approach
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
will best serve republicans
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
democrats and undeclared voters
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
and our state and our democracy
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to provide three stories that
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
happened approximately during the last
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
week or so
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
is an example
 
00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:11.349 align:start position:0%
is an example
among

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
among
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
the republican party and extremists
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
please do not listen to these folks
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
and they're ill
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
today we all said the pledge of
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the united states of
 
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.589 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the united states of
america

00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
america
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
i hope all of us
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
and all of you
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
believe every word of it and are not
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
i bring it up because nine gop members
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
house of representatives recently
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
postponed a bill
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
which provides for a quote
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
that the state peaceably declares
 
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:54.309 align:start position:0%
that the state peaceably declares
independence

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
independence
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
from independence to the united states
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
and proceeds as a sovereign nation
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is what extremist leading
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting brings forth
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
they are returning
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
story two
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire executive council with
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
his cop majority
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
following the lead of anti-masters
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine extremists who
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
at one point forced the cancellation
 
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.150 align:start position:0%
at one point forced the cancellation
unit

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
that board then later rejected 27
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal funding to
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
help the state by your pilgrimage
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
they did so even though governor chris
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
sununu later said our state
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
coveted response really demands
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
depends on this money
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's a disservice to all of us
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
we are elected to serve to anyone
 
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.670 align:start position:0%
we are elected to serve to anyone
watching

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
watching
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
it seemed the executive council caved in
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
to the screaming law
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
the extremists
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
now new hampshire is the only state
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the nation to have declined abundant
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
and in essence
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
gave our hard
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
earned tax moneys a way to support other
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
states like massachusetts vermont new
 
00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.190 align:start position:0%
states like massachusetts vermont new
york

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
york
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
new jersey
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
allow them fight probably
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
this is not very fiscally responsible
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
some of this was pushed forward by
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
extremists and that's why i'm pleading
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
with you not to take that course
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
story three and there's a message in
 
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.829 align:start position:0%
story three and there's a message in
there

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
in multiple also this week
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
similar anti-vaccine anti-matters groups
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
demanded via petition that a vote be
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
held by the school board
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
the petition demanded to mask the
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
optional or extracurricular activities
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
it would reverse the school board's
 
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.230 align:start position:0%
it would reverse the school board's
mandate

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.829 align:start position:0%
mandate
however

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
the good people of very conservative
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
leading moultonborough
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
voted to support the school board's mass
 
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.589 align:start position:0%
voted to support the school board's mass
standard

00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
more than 350 people voted
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
and 57 percent of them voted for the
 
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
and 57 percent of them voted for the
mandate

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's a backlash toward the extreme
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it might be for the republican party
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
a harbinger of the future
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
you have a choice
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
as you may redistricting you will you
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
can listen to the good people of both
 
00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.109 align:start position:0%
can listen to the good people of both
world

00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
by the extremists some of whom would
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
divide our nation and separate your
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
nation from it
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
it could backfire and permanently hurt
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
the gop
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
especially if moltenborough is a sign
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
where rational voters are headed
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
which is a way of extremist politics i
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
hope all of you consider
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
to stay as far away from it as you can
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
and your balance district
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
to bring our country back into balance
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.829 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
think everything that i would have said
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm having trouble understanding exactly
 
00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:39.550 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:54.790 align:start position:0%

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know all of the dynamics that we
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
use in those maps when i look at them
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
they look like they have been use to
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
make it as fair
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
and i think fairness is the thing that
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
need to be fair to all citizens any
 
00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.870 align:start position:0%
need to be fair to all citizens any
state

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
not just one party or the other
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think if you look at the numbers
 
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.829 align:start position:0%
i think if you look at the numbers
democrats

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
democrats
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
and republicans are not able with this
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
awesome lives
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
in the middle

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%

00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
something that i haven't paid much
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
attention to and that
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that there is information
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
there that we can
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
use and maybe not used enough is the
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee website
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
and so i just want to point out that
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh if i haven't been looking at it i'm
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
sure that many other people haven't done
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
it as well i know that there is the
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
um nonpartisan group i'm working on
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
developing maps but i just encourage all
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
of us to use
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
the uh house website as well and look at
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
all of the work that uh or all of the
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
information that is there um and as
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative said my concerns are
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as those you've
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
that there is a deadline of november
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
but i also understand that the deadlines
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the legislature have been and will
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
continue to be flexible
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it is possible for you
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to return to every
 
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.270 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to return to every
county

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the maps but to somehow provide a
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
process where we can see
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
the work that you do
 
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
the work that you do
and

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.270 align:start position:0%
and
and

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think it opportunity go a long ways
 
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.309 align:start position:0%
i think it opportunity go a long ways
towards

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%

trust in the process
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
um you've heard concerns about having a
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
virtual meeting we can't do it
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
but possibly do one i know that it is
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
the speaker's
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
designation that there should be no

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of communities of interest or
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
communities of affinity
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
i live in the little finger at the top

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
suggest that our affinity is north to

redoes it so that that

the northern part of downtown

comfortable
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh a relationship i don't think because

sugar hill in those areas have always
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
been related to

uh littleton and bethlehem in a way
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
that northern federal council is not so

01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
the thing that's really tricky is
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
because we have to keep towns together
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
and because
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
every town has to be in a base district
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and because they can't cross county
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
lines and they certainly can't cross
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
state lines
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh trying to make the numbers come out
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
right when almost everybody else in the
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%

and

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
when you have a floater
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
on the top of that
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
when you have one town that's only a
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
little bit off and one town was very
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
much off
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%

the new hampshire supreme court will
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
tell us we can't do it that way and
 
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.349 align:start position:0%
tell us we can't do it that way and
those

01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
those are the considerations that have
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
to be taken into consideration before
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
you even get to the communities of
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
interest piece
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
which is why it's really difficult in
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
the house it's much easier to sell it
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
because thank you representatives
 
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:20.730 align:start position:0%
because thank you representatives

[Music]
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
is slightly higher
 
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:32.690 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:37.349 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
all right well i think i am going to
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
take this chance to sort of go over a
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
little bit about what i spoke at the
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
beginning there's lots of comments about
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
providing student access if you want to
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
access that means you can be watching us
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
on youtube right now as we're speaking
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
and you will be able to go online to the
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
general court website and watch this
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow if you didn't have
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
enough of it tonight because i'm going
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
to post it usually pretty much first in
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.190 align:start position:0%
the morning
and

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
you can take a look at it there you can
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
also take a look at all the other
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
publication sessions we've had we have
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
two more
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled next week we have hillsborough
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
and donald county
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
also on that website to review we have
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
and those criteria have been discussed
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
at meetings
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
and agreed upon which are
 
01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
and agreed upon which are
constitutionally

01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
required

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
we also have to make certain assumptions
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
in regards to cities
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
when you start to talk 400
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
representatives and trying to figure out
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
how you're going to split them up
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
between 1.3 plus million people it
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
starts to get pretty
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
complicated with the numbers and keep in
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
mind we have to stay within council
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
boundaries we can't go outside
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
accounting for your representatives here
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
in carroll county
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
so if you go on that website you will be
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
able to see what we've been talking
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
about and criteria and again you can
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at what maps have been
 
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
take a look at what maps have been
submitted

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
um you can view submitted testimony and
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
it will ask you what bill you want to
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
look at and the bills are for
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
the various things i told you about at
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the beginning in regards to rediscipline
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
the senate is one bill the house is
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
the congressional districts are another
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
bill so you can just look at the list
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
and pick the district you click on it
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then you can see
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the submissions
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm on it pretty much every day so i
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
know that there are some maps up there
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
so you can take a look at those maps and
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
you can submit
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee directly from
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
that website by going back and forth so
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
as has been referenced there have been
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
sort of decisions made about soon
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
meetings if people want to talk to me
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
afterwards about it i'm happy to um but
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
if you are able to participate in the
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
consumers you can get on the website and
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
get that information to us and i will
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
tell you it will get to all committee
 
01:10:17.199 --> 01:10:18.229 align:start position:0%
tell you it will get to all committee
members

01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
as i explained not all committee members
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
are here tonight
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
but those emails to committee members go
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
to everyone and that website can be
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
viewed by everyone so we certainly
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
encourage you
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
to use it because we're we're pretty
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
happy it's up there i'd like to look a
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
little for you but it's certainly
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
personal and can get you the information
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful and for you to
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
submit to us that would be helpful also
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
senator gray do you have anything you
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
want to say um just that when you try to
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
do all the house members that's one
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
website the senate has its own website
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh the easiest way to get there is right
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
off the general report page then on the
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
right hand side about halfway or more
 
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.550 align:start position:0%
right hand side about halfway or more
down

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
there's a link both to the house's
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
website and in the senate's website
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make that clear if you
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
do want to send to both committees you
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
would need to go to
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
both of the email addresses that are
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
so with that is there anybody else who'd
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
like to see here
 
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:40.430 align:start position:0%
like to see here
senator

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just i think it's the 25th a week
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
from this coming monday
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
i've scheduled a meeting it's only a
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
15-minute meeting
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
because there won't be a lot to discuss
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
but we will
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know at that meeting we'll make some
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
decisions uh as a chair you know there's
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
a i can schedule meetings but i can't do
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
a whole lot so uh you know you will get
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know and the rest of the committee
 
01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.709 align:start position:0%
you know and the rest of the committee
to

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
express your opinions
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
on the house side i think you might have
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
heard there's the date of november 18th
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
those of you who are here from the house
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
now maybe
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
calendar days that we follow and we will
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
be meeting the november 18th deadline
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
because that doesn't end the legislative
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
process is well known
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
that goes into next year
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
um so we will be done with that part of
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
our work by november 18th which is why
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted to get out here so we can
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
start looking at things and
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
the final schedules have not been
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
figured out but again if you go to that
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
website as soon as meetings are
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled you will see them on that
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
website and you'll be able to
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing as soon as
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
friendly committee members know what
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
they're doing and i have figured out
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing um because that's
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens when something gets
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
said it goes to the staff who puts it
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
out on the calendar and on the website
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you'll be able to watch
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
and with that i want to thank you all
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
very much for coming tonight and and
