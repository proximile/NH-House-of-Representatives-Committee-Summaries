good morning everybody
 
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.310 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
uh

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to our
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
first executive session
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have four bills
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if we could um
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
let's start with hb
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
1300 and
 
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.749 align:start position:0%
1300 and
um

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's been recommended for
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative lin would you like to
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
speak to this please
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
sure um the recommendation for interim
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
study of results from the fact that as
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh the original request
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill was for a 500 000
 
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
in this bill was for a 500 000
appropriation

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
for the ash landfill
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
the money was
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
make up for
 
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
it if
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
make up for a shortfall in what
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
says is the amount that should be kept
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
as a for lack of a better term as a sort
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
of bond
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the event that
 
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.909 align:start position:0%
in the event that
um

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the current operators of the
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
landfill which is a non-profit
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
organization were to
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
kind of go out of business so to speak
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the the state were required to take
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
over the landfill um and and you know to
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
if there was some problem what is the
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money that would be needed to
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
to correct the problem
 
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
to correct the problem
the

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
the difficulty here is that
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
the need for this arose from the fact
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
that at the time the the
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
non-profit was first established i think
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
it was in the early 90s
 
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
it was in the early 90s
to

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
the landfill the des regulations at that
 
00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
the landfill the des regulations at that
time

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
said that there had to be sufficient
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
money in in a bond-like
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
structure to take care of the landfill
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
for a 30-year period
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
um and so the the operators of landfill
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe that as time went on and that
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
they got closer to the end of that
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
30-year period they were entitled to
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
spend some money out of the out of out
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
the bond fund if you will for the
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing operating expenses of the of the
 
00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
ongoing operating expenses of the of the
landfill

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
later after this uh
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
after the the uh the non-profit
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
organization uh was established and had
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
done this des changed its regulations
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
they say
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
it was merely a classification i mean a
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
clarification but
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think to a lot of us on division two
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
it seemed like it was really a change in
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
the regulations that says
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
that now says the 30-year period is a is
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
an ongoing
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
rolling 30-year period it's sort of an
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
effect is perpetual and and in light of
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
that the the uh landfill was was below
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
what it should have had uh
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
in discussions as we as we proceeded
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
through this it appears very likely that
 
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.550 align:start position:0%
through this it appears very likely that
that

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
um the state and the and the operators
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
of landfill are going to be able to come
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
to an agreement to resolve this
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh this matter and probably i don't know
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
this for sure but probably it's going to
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
involve something along the lines of
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to recognize
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
that they kind of change the regulations
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say look we're just
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to bring an enforcement
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
action against you
 
00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
action against you
um

00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that for sure but the state
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
and the and the operators of landfill
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
apparently feel very confident that they
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
will be able to come to a resolution
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
there was no sense on division two among
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
anyone that we should uh appropriate the
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars and we
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
thought that the interim study was the
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
best way to deal with it okay
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%

motion of itl on house bill 1054 and i'd
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
like to speak to my motion
please

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair a few points on
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
you may recall uh the sponsor
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
spoke very briefly and he asked us to
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
itl the bill
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
upon further research it appears as i
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
know most of you are familiar but the
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislative performance audit and
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee typically requests
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
audits they did not do so in this case
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
for state police
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly it appears that the
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
office of the legislative budget
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
assistant completed a financial audit of
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
the state police for the period ending
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
on march 31
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
2019 so to spend state resources on an
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
audit that was performed so recently is
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so for that reason i would
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
encourage all of you to vote on
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
t l thank you madam chair okay thank you
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions that anyone has
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
just just hatched just to point i i
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
think wasn't the bill asking for a
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
performance audit not a financial audit
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
and they're they're bifurcated they're
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
two entirely different things that's
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
point represent mooney

with um
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
wanting uh or attempting to add an adult

dental benefit to medicaid
 
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.710 align:start position:0%
dental benefit to medicaid
and

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the classic
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
arguments have been
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
that this good dental care is good
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
health care and
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
we should go ahead and make sure that
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
our citizens have good health care
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
the other view has been
 
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.269 align:start position:0%
the other view has been
that

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
we we should not be in a position to
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
continually expand medicaid
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
due to the cost of the taxpayers and
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
some questions about the uh
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
efficiency of the of the program so
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
those are the two classic cases what
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
what we've tried to do with 103 in
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.269 align:start position:0%
division three
is

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
and with me personally is i've i've
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
hhs's working group
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
for many many months
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
and we have come to an accommodation
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
between these two
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes or no positions
 
00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:20.230 align:start position:0%
yes or no positions
where

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say yes in a way in
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
which it recognizes some some core
 
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
which it recognizes some some core
principles

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
principles
 
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.789 align:start position:0%
principles
we

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
we
are

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.669 align:start position:0%
are
acknowledging

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
acknowledging
 
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:32.390 align:start position:0%
acknowledging
that

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
individuals are the ones who are
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for their own oral
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
health they without the individual
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
involvement uh you it does it doesn't
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
matter what somebody tries to do for you
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
you're just not gonna have good uh
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
dental care
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we've established in it to
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
to reflect the individual responsibility
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
a co-pay so that only those making at
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
least 100 percent of the federal poverty
 
00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.909 align:start position:0%
least 100 percent of the federal poverty
level

00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
would contribute 10 towards their pay
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is a fairness issue because pretty
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
much everyone who has dental insurance
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the state has to pay something for it
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so this is this is our saying we're
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
not giving this category of people a
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
free benefit they have to buy in just
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
like everyone else has to buy in the
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
other thing is on the dentures
 
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.070 align:start position:0%
other thing is on the dentures
we

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
limited it to those who seem to be in a
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
situation to be responsible for the care
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the dentures so those in
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
long-term nursing facilities and then
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
choices for independence they would be
 
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.190 align:start position:0%
choices for independence they would be
eligible

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.470 align:start position:0%
eligible
and

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
and also the developmentally disabled
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
community would would be
 
00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
community would would be
eligible

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
so you know that le that that carve out
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
does leave out a
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
pretty significant number of people
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
but we've gotten i've gotten assurances
 
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.310 align:start position:0%
but we've gotten i've gotten assurances
from

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
one of the mcos that they
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
will seriously look at providing the
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
denture care to those who are not
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
eligible on a charitable basis because
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of their their mission and
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
they've been doing that for adults
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
for years now we put a cap on it for
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars and we found a
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
source of the initial funding from the
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
centene settlement fund that that's was
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
reflected in the senate version of this
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so we borrowed what they did
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh we're proposing to
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
take 18.4 million of the centene
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
settlement fund
 
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.909 align:start position:0%
settlement fund
the

00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
senate version also wanted to fund 2.4
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
million of that
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
settlement fund for something called a
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
risk corridor we had no hearings on the
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
risk corridor so we just carved it out
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
so um i would uh ask that you uh vote
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
for this um amended version um
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh i i know uh
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
several people will not
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
because of the concern about expansion
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the medicaid program i respect that
 
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.590 align:start position:0%
of the medicaid program i respect that
position

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.549 align:start position:0%
position
um

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless i think this is a a
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
good way to proceed that accommodates uh
 
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
good way to proceed that accommodates uh
historic

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%

against the youth development center and
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%

but this spans the entire entire
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
gamut of
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
the process that we have uh established
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
with this
amendment

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
is that anyone a claimant

to the ag's designee
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
who will determine
[Music]

[Music]
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
what sort of
 
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.350 align:start position:0%
what sort of
settlement

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
we have capped
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse at 1.5 million
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
and we have capped fiscal abuse at 150
 
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:51.350 align:start position:0%
and we have capped fiscal abuse at 150
000.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh if the claimant accepts the
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
ag designee's position
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're very happy about that
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
if the claimant does not accept
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
the ag designee's position
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
they have an opportunity to
 
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
they have an opportunity to
withdraw

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
and go to court
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
or they have the opportunity
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
to go to what we are calling
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
an administrator
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
that will be working for the supreme
 
00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:27.029 align:start position:0%
that will be working for the supreme
court

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.149 align:start position:0%
court
and

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.029 align:start position:0%
and
then

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
that person
 
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.909 align:start position:0%
that person
will

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
decide what the final award will be
 
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.870 align:start position:0%
decide what the final award will be
so

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.470 align:start position:0%
so
then

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
prior to all of this starting
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the ag
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
claimants council as we know
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
them to be now
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
will set up uh guidelines
 
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
will set up uh guidelines
for

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
the the award
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
mary jane insisted i'm sorry
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative walner insisted that that
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee
 
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.630 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee
for

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
for approval
 
00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:15.269 align:start position:0%
for approval
so

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
anyhow so it will be coming back to the
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee for approval
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we felt that um because this is
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with money and awards
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
and um
how

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
how this whole system is going to work
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
that we felt that um this was an
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
because it involves both the house and
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
the senate
um

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.029 align:start position:0%
um
finally

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh i'll just say that uh
 
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.350 align:start position:0%
uh i'll just say that uh
if

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
oh we we did basically set aside 100
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
for these these settlements
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know it'll it'll be the 100 million
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
will cover it
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the ag has the option of coming back
 
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
the ag has the option of coming back
to

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
the
legislature

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
for additional funds
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
but we are hoping against hope
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the hundred million will cover
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of the uh
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
of these claimants that that are out
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we stand and i would simply
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
ask that you please
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
vote yes
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions or comments uh yes represent
 
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.230 align:start position:0%
questions or comments uh yes represent
rogers

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
um first of all i want to commend the
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
the folks all of us worked on this and
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
and it's a much better bill with the
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment than it was when it came in
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
and by and large it's a great bill
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
however there are two points that i
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
we need to consider and the reason i
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
can't support it at this time
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
um one capping the settlements at the
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
amounts that representative umber talked
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
about i don't think is fair
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of cases that have
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
come out of the federal court that have
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
had much larger awards so the claimants
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
if we want them to come to this
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
instead of going to court civil court on
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
their own i think we need to be
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
realistic so i think we need to raise
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
that cap
 
00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.510 align:start position:0%
that cap
um

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
from the 1.5 and 150 000 the second
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
point is the scope of the abuse
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
we've limited the scope of the abuse i
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
think we need to broaden it
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
remember we're talking about over or
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
close to 50 years of abuse that's
 
00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:05.029 align:start position:0%
close to 50 years of abuse that's
happened

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
while the state
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
had custody of these children
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
i know that they're not all children now
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
but still
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
we had a duty
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
to care for these people
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
and we failed in that duty
 
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
and we failed in that duty
um

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
and i think by not including all abuse
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we're not being fair we're saying
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
one victim is better than the other
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
i would hope that we could include
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
things such as
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse and especially unlawful
 
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.389 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse and especially unlawful
confinement

00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
confinement
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
we know that there are um
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs that were put into solitary
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
confinement for up to six months time
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
and we've got a lot of literature a lot
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
of studies that have shown that solitary
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
confinement is terribly
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
terribly harmful to a child
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
and it's almost like these were the
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
forgotten children we put them in here
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
we abused them we threw them into
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement we did other things
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
i think if we're going to own up which
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
we are and that's why this is such a
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
great bill happening now and i
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
especially commend the sponsors like
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative umberger for doing this
 
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:10.789 align:start position:0%
representative umberger for doing this
but

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
we need to include everyone we can't be
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
selective so for those two points
 
00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:16.549 align:start position:0%
selective so for those two points
um

00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
i know we made great progress and as i
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
said i think this is a good bill but it
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
could be better so that's why i can't
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
support it at this time
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments or
 
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments or
questions

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner thank you um
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
chairman ember
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
i do agree with uh representative rogers
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that there are a couple of um
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
outstanding issues that we did not
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
resolve as we
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
worked on this amendment
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
i am going to support the bill because i
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
feel like it is
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
the state's responsibility to set up
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
this settlement fund
 
00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.230 align:start position:0%
this settlement fund
and

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
the um i think that what we've got here
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
is something that will be very helpful
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the claimants and to the victims
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
and provide a process that will be
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
much friendlier
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
than if people have to end up going to
 
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.470 align:start position:0%
than if people have to end up going to
court

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i'm going to
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
support the bill i am
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
still concerned about the two areas that
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't seem to get a resolution
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
for but
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
as we know in legislation things leave
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
the house and go over to the senate and
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
then they get to put their mark on it so
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens over there so for
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
those reasons i am going to support the
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you are there any other
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
non-germain bill a little bit earlier
 
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.190 align:start position:0%

representative heath's name there or
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%

03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
well it appears that the department of
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture has a
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
pilot program going on
 
03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
that allows the states to apply
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
to become part of the pilot program
 
03:06:38.550 --> 03:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
so that the information that is in
 
03:06:38.560 --> 03:06:40.469 align:start position:0%
so that the information that is in
medicaid

03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:06:40.479 --> 03:06:41.429 align:start position:0%
medicaid
and

03:06:41.429 --> 03:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
the information from the school
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
will now
 
03:06:46.479 --> 03:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
will now
meet

03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:06:51.670 --> 03:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
and it will reduce significantly
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
the number of people that need to fill
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
out the free and reduced lunch form
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
there will still be a few people
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
that need to fill out the form
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
03:07:05.040 --> 03:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
because they're
they

03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
although they have health insurance
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
their income is
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
low enough that they qualify for the
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch program
 
03:07:15.920 --> 03:07:17.110 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch program
so

03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's what this non-germane amendment
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
is all about
 
03:07:21.920 --> 03:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
is all about
is

03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
asking doe to go forward apply
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
for this um
 
03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
pilot program and uh
 
03:07:33.990 --> 03:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully will
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
it will occur
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that we'll be able to
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
start this program
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the next year or so
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
that it will be um
 
03:07:47.359 --> 03:07:48.790 align:start position:0%
that it will be um
effective

03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
so that in the 2024 budget cycle and
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
what the schools will be receiving in
 
03:07:56.399 --> 03:07:57.910 align:start position:0%
what the schools will be receiving in
2024

03:07:57.910 --> 03:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
2024
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
will use this
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
particular program
 
03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
so thank you are there
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
so thank you are there

03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for a question uh
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
taking my questions i i'm so sorry this
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
first time i've looked at this bill at
 
03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
all and so i'm just trying to wrap my
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
head around the uh construct of this
 
03:08:18.479 --> 03:08:19.349 align:start position:0%
head around the uh construct of this
is

03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
from a a parent's or a student's
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
perspective i'd like to under understand
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
what their benefit is
 
03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:27.590 align:start position:0%
what their benefit is
if

03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:08:32.070 --> 03:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
we do have them in a demonstration pilot
 
03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't feel to me like it gives that
 
03:08:36.150 --> 03:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
school any more money it doesn't feel
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
like it gives that school
 
03:08:40.630 --> 03:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
like a breakfast meal in addition to
 
03:08:43.349 --> 03:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
what they're doing it just seems to me
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
from what you said that the only benefit
 
03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
is reduced paperwork to the family
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question um
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
we don't know at this point what that
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
effect might be on the financial side of
 
03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
effect might be on the financial side of
it

03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how many
 
03:09:05.910 --> 03:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
people that are eligible for free and
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch have not applied
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we're
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to maximize
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
the number of people that apply for free
 
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
because it also affects our title one
 
03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:27.190 align:start position:0%
because it also affects our title one
programs

03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
and how much money goes to the various
 
03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:31.349 align:start position:0%
and how much money goes to the various
districts

03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
districts
 
03:09:32.950 --> 03:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
03:09:34.630 --> 03:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
on title one
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
as far as the individual parents go
 
03:09:40.229 --> 03:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's simply one thing
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to worry about
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
and it will take a lot of work off from
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
03:09:50.950 --> 03:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
because they're no longer going to have
 
03:09:53.670 --> 03:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
to go out chasing parents to fill out
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch form
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay so it sounds like the the uh two
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
key benefits are uh
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
simpler administration for the school
 
03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
and anytime you have less paperwork the
 
03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:10.150 align:start position:0%
and anytime you have less paperwork the
better

03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
is a rule of thumb
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing is that there
 
03:10:17.269 --> 03:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
may be a monetary gain
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
under this theory that
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
some people who could be eligible for
 
03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
the program just simply aren't doing the
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
paperwork and therefore the school's
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
missing out on that money
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
this is going to throw a wider net and
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
just grab
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
a group of people so the total number
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
per school might end up going up because
 
03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's they're just being brought in by
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
default that's that's correct all right
 
03:10:41.890 --> 03:10:41.900 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
03:10:41.900 --> 03:10:43.030 align:start position:0%
thank you so much

[Music]
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative heath for a question
 
03:10:48.550 --> 03:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just would like to add
 
03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:49.349 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just would like to add
that

03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:52.630 --> 03:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
in addition to those um
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
certain aspects that this will mean that
 
03:10:57.910 --> 03:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
more children will have access to
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch programs
 
03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
than we've seen before because often
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason a form doesn't get
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
filled out so we don't know that that
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
child may be eligible and they may end
 
03:11:12.550 --> 03:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
up going a day without any kind of food
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
during the day so i think that's a big
 
03:11:17.349 --> 03:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
plus in addition to
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
the increase in numbers and i think we
 
03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
heard how many students
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
this could possibly impact was it as
 
03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
all right yeah but it was it was
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
quite a number
 
03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that in
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
in school funding right now
 
03:11:40.480 --> 03:11:40.490 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
03:11:40.490 --> 03:11:41.830 align:start position:0%
we have um
[Music]

03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
we're using the 2019 numbers for free
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
at the public schools
 
03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
at the public schools
and

03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:55.750 --> 03:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's the number we've budgeted for
 
03:11:58.630 --> 03:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
22 and 23.
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
we need to find some way
 
03:12:07.429 --> 03:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
to sort out
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
what we uh how many children we actually
 
03:12:10.399 --> 03:12:11.349 align:start position:0%
what we uh how many children we actually
have

03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the public schools and free and
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
because we do know
 
03:12:16.399 --> 03:12:18.469 align:start position:0%
because we do know
that

03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
several students have chosen other
 
03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
several students have chosen other
options

03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
options
 
03:12:25.349 --> 03:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
for their uh k-12 education
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
and how many of those are in that
 
03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
category we we don't have any idea we
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
also know that uh overall enrollment has
 
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
gone down
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative lynn for a question and
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
then representative petry
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
yes uh can you just refresh my my memory
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
on this i know i've heard on about this
 
03:12:51.429 --> 03:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
before but if somebody
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody qualifies for medicaid
 
03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
does that automatically mean then that
 
03:12:59.590 --> 03:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're that they would be they would be
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
eligible for the free and reduced lunch
 
03:13:01.439 --> 03:13:03.269 align:start position:0%
eligible for the free and reduced lunch
program

03:13:03.269 --> 03:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes all right ask one follower follow-up
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
this is just on a completely different
 
03:13:07.359 --> 03:13:08.070 align:start position:0%
this is just on a completely different
uh

03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:09.349 align:start position:0%
uh
topic

03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
relating to this is there any uh issue
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
any concern that by doing this
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
somehow the
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know privacy interests of people who
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
are receiving medicaid will somehow
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
there'll be some disclosure that
 
03:13:24.070 --> 03:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't otherwise occur that we should
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
be concerned about
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
i believe the answer to that is no
 
03:13:32.469 --> 03:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
primarily because it's a pilot program
 
03:13:35.429 --> 03:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
that is operating in several states at
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
this point
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that all of those privacy
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
considerations have been
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
have been worked out
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
because that was one of the issues that
 
03:13:48.630 --> 03:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
we had
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
in trying to do it just at the state
 
03:13:50.800 --> 03:13:52.229 align:start position:0%
in trying to do it just at the state
level

03:13:52.229 --> 03:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
because there was concern from
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
dhhs i don't want to put words in your
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
i you know the concern at the at the
 
03:14:06.150 --> 03:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
state level
 
03:14:07.990 --> 03:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
was in
 
03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:08.830 align:start position:0%
was in
the

03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:10.950 --> 03:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid side
 
03:14:12.389 --> 03:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
they used
 
03:14:14.070 --> 03:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
names and social security numbers i
 
03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:15.190 align:start position:0%
names and social security numbers i
believe

03:14:15.190 --> 03:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
and in the um
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
education side they only use student
 
03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:22.630 align:start position:0%
education side they only use student
numbers

03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
student identifiers so
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
obviously somehow or other
 
03:14:30.870 --> 03:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
at the federal level it's been worked
 
03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:33.190 align:start position:0%
at the federal level it's been worked
out

03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
represented petrie for a question
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
my question is this a precursor to uh
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
eliminating the forms altogether i know
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
we've talked about
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
making uh in other words funding the
 
03:14:50.309 --> 03:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
entire school lunch
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
for everyone and then uh doing away with
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:00.550 --> 03:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:02.229 align:start position:0%
uh no
um

03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
this will do away with probably 98 of
 
03:15:06.710 --> 03:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
the forms
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
that had been filled out before
 
03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
it'll just be the small minority of
 
03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:13.269 align:start position:0%
it'll just be the small minority of
people

03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:15:13.279 --> 03:15:14.469 align:start position:0%
people
that

03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:14.479 --> 03:15:15.990 align:start position:0%
that
qualify

03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
03:15:17.590 --> 03:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
but have their own
 
03:15:21.190 --> 03:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for a question uh
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
just just curious about um
 
03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
the effect on
 
03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
students outside of the traditional
 
03:15:34.229 --> 03:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
neighborhood schools those that have
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
used efas for example to go to private
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
schools or to home school
 
03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
will will
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
do we think any money will follow them
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
or is this all meant to be
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
within the
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
four four corners of the traditional
 
03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
four four corners of the traditional
schools

03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes
 
03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
the children with the efas would benefit
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
anything further so the department of um
 
03:16:12.399 --> 03:16:13.750 align:start position:0%
anything further so the department of um
agriculture

03:16:13.750 --> 03:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
is this because of food stamps is there
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
a connection in here with that it's
 
03:16:19.750 --> 03:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
because the they're the ones that
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
provide the food
 
03:16:24.630 --> 03:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
for the schools right and so
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
right now the department of agriculture
 
03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
everybody gets to eat
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know they have funded 100 no matter
 
03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:34.309 align:start position:0%
you know they have funded 100 no matter
what

03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:16:37.429 --> 03:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
what your income level is or so on and
 
03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
and so they're able to to uh access the
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
hhs lists
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay that which we can never seem to be
 
03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
able to do in the department of ed
 
03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:47.990 align:start position:0%
able to do in the department of ed
but

03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:16:50.070 --> 03:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
through them this this will happen okay
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
now i understand it better
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:55.520 --> 03:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative umberger is there someone
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll get them to fill out a pink
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
good evening mark manganiellos
 
03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
administrator office of school finance
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
with the department of education
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
chairwoman omburger did an excellent job
 
03:17:17.920 --> 03:17:19.269 align:start position:0%
chairwoman omburger did an excellent job
describing

03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
describing
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
the what she was working on back in the
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
fall through the the winter as far as
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
the work session between
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
finance and education house finance and
 
03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
house education
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
some of the key issues she she touched
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
on is is the fnr data has been a
 
03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:35.269 align:start position:0%
on is is the fnr data has been a
long-standing

03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
long-standing
 
03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
challenge for families and districts and
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
recently the pandemic because the usda
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
offered a universal waiver meaning you
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
do not need to fill out the application
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
to get the benefit of school lunch
 
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
that has significantly impacted our fnr
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
data so one of the main charges of that
 
03:17:53.190 --> 03:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
work group was
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
how do we make the adequacy formula
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
instead of modifying the fnr data every
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
year how can we
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh stabilize the fnr data and this is a
 
03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
solution that chairwomanberger
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
sort of identified as a fix to that
 
03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
sort of identified as a fix to that
problem

03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
and so if there's any i know we're good
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing some more detailed work
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
in division two but if there's any
 
03:18:15.429 --> 03:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
questions i'm available
 
03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
to answer them
 
03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee how do
 
03:18:23.190 --> 03:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
we prevent an over count
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
there so
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can um
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the challenge with an over count is
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
essentially the way we currently operate
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
is we try our best to identify every
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
student who is experiencing poverty
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
inside a school we try our best and we
 
03:18:45.190 --> 03:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
ask families to try their best to
 
03:18:47.190 --> 03:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
identify themselves as experiencing
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
poverty inside of school
 
03:18:49.359 --> 03:18:50.389 align:start position:0%
poverty inside of school
um

03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
if we happen to find more students
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing poverty than we previously
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
known about i i the way this would have
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
to work is we have to pay
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have to count them towards adequacy
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
um because we are now being made aware
 
03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
that there is a child experiencing
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
poverty in a district's responsibility
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the way the formula works and the
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
way kind of the constitutional construct
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the formula works is we have to fund
 
03:19:11.520 --> 03:19:12.630 align:start position:0%
of the formula works is we have to fund
that

03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
get a little bit into the weeds there
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
i would say it would be hard to to stop
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
an overcount
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes it would if we take away the
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility from the parents who
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise might have filled out the
 
03:19:27.910 --> 03:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork and are irresponsible
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden you're going to
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
have everybody qualified and
 
03:19:33.510 --> 03:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
our costs for education are going to go
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
sky high
 
03:19:37.110 --> 03:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
so these families would be these
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
particular families would be not filling
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
out the f r application but they would
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
be filling out a medicaid application
 
03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:43.910 align:start position:0%
be filling out a medicaid application
so

03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if it correlates if
 
03:19:47.190 --> 03:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
you're not filling out enough in our
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
application but you are filling out a
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
medicaid application um
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know irresponsibility
 
03:19:52.399 --> 03:19:53.910 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know irresponsibility
persists

03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
persists
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
they won't fill out one form they won't
 
03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
fill out the other
 
03:19:56.800 --> 03:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
fill out the other
potentially

03:19:58.950 --> 03:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it all works out i guess
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this for a year and
 
03:20:03.670 --> 03:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
see what happens any other questions
 
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much anybody
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
else would like to testify
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
please come forward identify yourself
 
03:20:17.190 --> 03:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
and after you complete testifying would
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
hi introduce yourself thank you thank
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%

03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm kelly rambo the administrator
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%

for the office of nutrition programs and
services

03:20:38.790 --> 03:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to finance to
 
03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
enlighten us you're welcome
 
03:20:45.670 --> 03:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to touch upon
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
the application process for for this
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
program um it is a pilot program
 
03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:52.870 align:start position:0%
program um it is a pilot program
um

03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
like the two previous speakers had said
 
03:20:54.960 --> 03:20:56.389 align:start position:0%
like the two previous speakers had said
before

03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we at the doe just wanted to
 
03:21:02.229 --> 03:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
say that we estimate
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
the initial application taking
 
03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
a senior individual such as myself
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
up to
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
about possibly five weeks to to complete
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
this depending on the the detail that is
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
needed for the actual application
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the application needs to be
 
03:21:18.720 --> 03:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
and the application needs to be
submitted

03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
um before september 20th of this school
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
of this year 2022.
 
03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:25.910 align:start position:0%
of this year 2022.
um

03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and there could be an additional 10 to
 
03:21:31.429 --> 03:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
10 to 20 hours given um
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
once we submit the application if
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
there's additional questions back from
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
the usda um they don't you know
 
03:21:39.990 --> 03:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
maybe possibly have a question on a
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
procedure that we have or something
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
along those lines so there's the
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
possibility of an additional 10 to 20
 
03:21:45.359 --> 03:21:47.110 align:start position:0%
possibility of an additional 10 to 20
hours

03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
hours
 
03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:48.309 align:start position:0%
hours
thus

03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
thus
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
we are requesting
 
03:21:55.830 --> 03:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
that 44 000 in the cl 120 to enter into
 
03:21:57.030 --> 03:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
a contract
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
with an entity or an individual to help
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
us with the application process due to
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
the timing
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the the process and the
 
03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you do you companion have anything
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
further to add
 
03:22:16.790 --> 03:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
no we're happy to respond to questions
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
the one that occurs immediately is the
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
criteria for free and reduced meals and
 
03:22:24.630 --> 03:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
the criteria for medicaid
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
so this program um
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
uses the free and reduced it uses the
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
same income limits for free and reduced
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
as for um
 
03:22:40.710 --> 03:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
that would qualify for medicaid for this
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
particular program so they're exactly
 
03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
equal that's correct good
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative lynn for a question yes
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know what can i just ask with regard
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
to the quite the request for funding for
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
to hide you know the 44 000 that you've
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
asked for i guess i'm i'm i'm not it's
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds like from what you're saying
 
03:23:03.269 --> 03:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
that this is sort of a very detailed you
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
said it will take five weeks to i guess
 
03:23:06.479 --> 03:23:06.750 align:start position:0%
said it will take five weeks to i guess
i'm

03:23:06.750 --> 03:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:23:06.760 --> 03:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
i'm
[Music]

03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
i can you elaborate on that a little
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
more in other words i i thought that the
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
idea just from looking at this that what
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
you would be requesting would be access
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
to information
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
from medicaid i guess through the
 
03:23:22.950 --> 03:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture on
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
the people in
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
a school district that
 
03:23:29.190 --> 03:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
that are you know the families qualify
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
or are are on medicaid so i'm not
 
03:23:33.510 --> 03:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm having trouble understanding
 
03:23:36.550 --> 03:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
what's so why is that
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to take so long sure thank you for
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
your question um so in an ideal world
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
that we would just be able to request
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
that information from dhhs but we know
 
03:23:50.229 --> 03:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
that usda requires additional
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
documentation that we need to be able in
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
order to be able to run this program
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
we need to submit a complete application
 
03:24:01.349 --> 03:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
to them and also where this is a pilot
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
program for the usda
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
they are looking to compile all of the
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
the states that run this program as a
 
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
pilot to see if it's going to be an
 
03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
effective program to run fully moving
 
03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
effective program to run fully moving
forward

03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
so just to add upon that it is an
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
extensive application process we have
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
had preliminary meetings with usda as
 
03:24:24.309 --> 03:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
well as other states who have considered
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
and pursued this application process
 
03:24:28.950 --> 03:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
and given the limited capacity of the
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
office of nutrition at this time we have
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
three staff and one administrator
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
historic levels of staffing have been
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
seven staff and an administrator so we
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the ability to
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
complete that application and respond to
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
inquiries and research a new process uh
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
given the capacity and thus would seek
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
to enter into a contract with an entity
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
or an individual with such expertise
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:58.229 --> 03:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative heath for a question
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
is it possible to use esser funding for
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
so esther funds um at the state level
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
must be and in all escrow funds in fact
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
must be utilized to prevent prepare for
 
03:25:17.349 --> 03:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
and respond to the kova 19 pandemic um
 
03:25:19.750 --> 03:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
so there there is potential that there
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
could be a rationale there that the free
 
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
and reduced price launch applications
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
and paperwork
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
submissions have been impacted by the
 
03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic but we would need to check that
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
would be a unique use that is not
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
neatly in prevent prepare for and
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
respond to the pandemic all right thank
 
03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:39.910 align:start position:0%
respond to the pandemic all right thank
you

03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
so if someone has four children
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
two of them are preschool
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
is that reflected when they fill out the
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid application or is it just i
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that we would need to
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
look into based off of the data that
 
03:26:00.870 --> 03:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
dhhs gives to us
 
03:26:03.429 --> 03:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
i would have to look at what data is
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
submitted and what what grade levels are
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to to the doe for that i
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
wonder if if
 
03:26:12.150 --> 03:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid asked for that detail
 
03:26:14.070 --> 03:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
the ages of the children that's
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
something that i currently don't know
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
the answer to because
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
again we might have an over count
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
two or three preschool children that
 
03:26:21.279 --> 03:26:22.150 align:start position:0%
two or three preschool children that
somehow

03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
are listed somewhere as free and reduced
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
and they're not even in school
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
i can find that information out for you
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay and then i'll
 
03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
just one last point if you allow me um
 
03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful for kelly to explain
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
the waivers and and the factors that are
 
03:26:41.429 --> 03:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
impacting the reduction in applications
 
03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
very briefly
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
um so as mark touched upon before we are
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
currently in
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
a waiver program that expires on june
 
03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:53.190 align:start position:0%
a waiver program that expires on june
30th

03:26:53.190 --> 03:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
30th
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
and that enables all students to get
 
03:26:59.670 --> 03:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
free breakfast and free lunch in school
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
i know that we have not received any
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
current information from usda that those
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
waivers will be extended so as it stands
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
right now we anticipate those waivers to
 
03:27:11.670 --> 03:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
expire on june 30th and we will be going
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
back to
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
free reduced paid
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
processes in the schools
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative petrie for a question
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
have you
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
enumerated the cost of what it's cost
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
whoever for this
 
03:27:33.750 --> 03:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know this waiver not not the
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
waiver itself but the the meals that uh
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
no we have not projected the impact of
 
03:27:46.469 --> 03:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh what medicaid utilizing medicaid data
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
instead of free and reduced price lunch
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
applications how that would impact
 
03:27:53.429 --> 03:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
potential meals served not currently
 
03:27:53.439 --> 03:27:54.389 align:start position:0%
potential meals served not currently
served

03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
served
 
03:27:55.670 --> 03:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
right no
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
if i could follow up
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
now is that i'm i'm talking about free
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
and reduced in total not necessarily
 
03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
just the medicaid
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know i mean how how
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
obviously there must be some calculation
 
03:28:11.190 --> 03:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
that that we've used
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
as far as free release free reduced and
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid combined in other words whoever
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
got free lunch
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
because of the waiver
 
03:28:21.190 --> 03:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
in other words is it 59 million dollars
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
um we don't currently have that data
 
03:28:33.750 --> 03:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.070 --> 03:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
i was wondering will this in any way
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
affect the child care food
 
03:28:42.319 --> 03:28:43.670 align:start position:0%
affect the child care food
program

03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
no this is strictly for national school
 
03:28:51.750 --> 03:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
much please fill out one of these for
 
03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we will call upon director lippman
 
03:29:04.870 --> 03:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
from hhs
 
03:29:08.229 --> 03:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
and he's got someone else with him
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
yep as long as we get all the names
 
03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:26.309 --> 03:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
i'll do it again sorry i should know by
 
03:29:29.190 --> 03:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
now right um henry lipman uh medicaid
 
03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:30.950 align:start position:0%
now right um henry lipman uh medicaid
director

03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
don landry medicaid policy administrator
 
03:29:36.870 --> 03:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:38.550 --> 03:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid's role in this is that we were
 
03:29:40.309 --> 03:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
trying to be helpful to
 
03:29:42.309 --> 03:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:29:42.319 --> 03:29:43.670 align:start position:0%
the committee
we

03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:29:45.590 --> 03:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
are aware of this the program and i
 
03:29:47.429 --> 03:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
think why
 
03:29:47.439 --> 03:29:48.710 align:start position:0%
think why
chairwoman

03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairwoman
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
berger was looking at this is because i
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
guess in terms of your formula for
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
school funding you want to use data
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's you know somewhat
 
03:29:56.880 --> 03:29:58.630 align:start position:0%
that's you know somewhat
more

03:29:58.630 --> 03:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:30:00.630 --> 03:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
in line with the year that you're
 
03:30:02.550 --> 03:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
running the formula and you know
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid potentially could be a support
 
03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of some of the questions i
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
heard um previously um asked by
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
committee members we could maybe fill in
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
a few blanks there
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
um i think you asked one um about
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
the do we get the age of the child on
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
the application we do
 
03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:22.389 align:start position:0%
the application we do
um

03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:22.399 --> 03:30:23.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:30:23.190 --> 03:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative lynn asked a question
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
about uh you know the information that's
 
03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
provided it's uh
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
the minimum minimum necessary in order
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
to provide to the department of
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
education for them to be able to
 
03:30:38.229 --> 03:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
administer the program
 
03:30:38.239 --> 03:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
administer the program
um

03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know i think from uh
 
03:30:45.910 --> 03:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know just purely from a fiscal
 
03:30:47.429 --> 03:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint in terms of your formula i
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
think there'd be a benefit from a
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid perspective um
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
you know we would look at the reason why
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
we'd want to be helpful here is that
 
03:30:56.950 --> 03:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
children who
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
qualify for the program who also get
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
nutrition will probably be
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
healthier and consume less medical care
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
i don't have any data to necessarily
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
back that up but that's that would be
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
the theory behind you know medicaid
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
putting effort to support this with the
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:31:15.190 --> 03:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%

03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
