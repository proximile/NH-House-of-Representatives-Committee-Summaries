state representative from Kean uh
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
chesher District 1 uh I am also a a
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
professor of history at Keane State
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
College for almost 20 years this is one
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
of the first bills that I filed my the
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
the thought process behind it was I want
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
history to be something that people
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
engage with uh in particular thinking
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
about public markers and public
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
monuments that you know we pass by them
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
every day uh relatively few of us too
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
few of us actually stop and read the
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
markers and think about their meaning
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that those markers and
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
monuments should be opportunities for
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
people to to learn uh and to engage in
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about our our shared history
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
so uh I also have a lot of friends who
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
are social studies teachers uh in middle
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
schools and this would be a really great
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity especially around National
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
History Day uh for there to be an
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
inventory in one place on a State
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
website of all of our publicly
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
maintained monuments and we had that
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
wording specifically in the bill
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
publicly maintained uh because that kind
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
of Narrows the universe of objects we're
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
talking about here there was a question
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
about what what is a marker what is a
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
monument well every municipality has a
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
list of monuments and markers it
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
maintains right so these are lists that
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
already exist it's a finite Universe of
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
of objects and if they're all in one
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
place and what I would love to see is
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
school groups who uh get projects you
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
know go out and find markers in your
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
town and do a report on that event on
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
that person I would also really love it
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
if some you know Middle School class
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
were to go to City Hall and enter a
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
petition to have a new marker for
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
somebody uh say look this person is
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
really important in the history of our
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
community and they haven't been
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
recognized I think that would be a
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
fabulous way to get our young people
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
engaged in studying the history of our
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the of our state and the many
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
cultures of our state so that was the
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
idea uh from the beginning it was it's
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
an educational tool it's a very Bare
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
Bones approach it is literally a uh
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to be a list I worked with uh with
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
the division to make sure that it would
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
not cost anything so that it is
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
something that can be done with the
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
resources that currently exist and it's
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
literally just a list now if at some
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
point there is grant money that becomes
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
available to kind of build that out into
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
a more searchable kind of tool that
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
would be great uh but the intention is
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
for this not to add any expenses to uh
 
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.069 align:start position:0%
for this not to add any expenses to uh
to

00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so that's the history of the
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill uh was I made a very
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
rookie mistake this is my first term
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
when I first entered it uh I uh had it
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
the the relative Department was the uh
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
State archives because I'm a historian
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
and I think about
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
archives uh and that was not the
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate dep department so and then
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
with some help of colleagues uh we had
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
the bill amended to make sure it went to
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
the appropriate division as I said where
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
there are no additional resources
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
required my concern about the many have
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
many concerns about the amendment
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
um most
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
importantly I understand uh first of all
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
we have public processes uh that that
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
currently exist and I understand those
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
processes are far from perfect uh I
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
myself I'm on environment and
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and uh I come up against
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
processes that do not give the public
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
the input that they should have that's a
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
struggle I think that we all have on our
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
various committees when we're trying to
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
make executive departments more
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
responsive to the needs of our
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
constituents but processes like this are
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
never ever made better by making them
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
partisan or ideological and that is
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens when you require an
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
act of the legislature we probably
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to agree on a lunch
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
order in one let alone two bodies and
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
yet this amendment would require both
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
bodies to con to agree on the on wording
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
on specific language if you were to
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
amend a marker uh that process bringing
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
politicians and political processes into
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
language around a historical marker is
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
frankly for me as a historian
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
mindboggling inconceivable that one
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
would ever do that but also if if we're
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
talking about which we should be what
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
best serves our constituents that's not
 
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.389 align:start position:0%
best serves our constituents that's not
it

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
making this something that we argue
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
about a word is this word derogatory how
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
old is this word let's talk about the
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
anemology let's talk about the history
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
in order to amend a
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
marker is unfathomable as far as I'm
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
concerned I I I do understand on some
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
level the part of the amendment that has
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
to do with the removal of
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
markers I personally am not in favor of
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
removing monuments and markers I'm in
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
favor of providing
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
context uh I would argue that you know
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
the idea that you can never take statues
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
down for example
 
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.230 align:start position:0%
down for example
is

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh simply not true we don't have statues
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
to King George III in American cities
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
anymore we took him down right that
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
happens when history changes when
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
culture changes it does happen it has
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
always happened in the history of this
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
country going back to at least the 18th
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
century right so but that's not what the
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is about I think more
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
context more discussion is always better
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
so I I think there's some room for a
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
conversation around removal of markers
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
but the notion that you would require
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
both houses of the state legislature to
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement on a language
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
change as I said is just unfathomable as
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned let's take the
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
processes that we have that are intended
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
to be responsive to the concerns of the
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
Republic to the public pardon me and
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
let's make those genuinely responsive
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
but as I said uh this amendment as far
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned actually takes us
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
further from that
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
goal thank
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
you any comments or questions by members
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee if I may well I thank you for
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you sharing your thoughts
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
on this I I guess my thought is when I
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
introduced this amendment is that
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
we uh you know we're putting these
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
markers up and we're allowing them to be
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
put up by you know by the historical
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
preservation Society um uh the office
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
excuse me but I there's really not a lot
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
of public input and I think that once we
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
have these things in place it's you know
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
when we're looking to make an amendment
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
or to to change something that it's been
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
established as at least a piece of
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
history on that marker by this by the uh
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
preservation office now when you want to
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
change that or you want to remove it to
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
me there needs to be some public the
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
input of we are the represented body of
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
the people we're elected to do that and
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's our job to sort of do all
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of things like this we we look at
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
many issues that sometimes you go I
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
don't know sure that should be in front
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the legislature but it is you know uh
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
we have very good deep and thoughtful
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
conversations and sometimes they are
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
contentious but it's okay but history is
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most important
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
things we have and making sure that the
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
preservation of it I think definitely
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
needs to have an opportunity to go
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
before the duly elected representatives
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the people when we're looking to make
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
a change and how that is portrayed to
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
our public so that is why I put this up
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
here because I felt it was a I agree
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
with you it's a little bit of a heavy
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
process it can seem like a sledgehammer
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
approach but I I think it puts the topic
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
out in front of the people and through
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
their elected body and I think it's a
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
good process to go through before we
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
start trying to change these markers or
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
remov we've seen um some situations that
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
are occurring around starting to occur
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
in our state as well we've certainly
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
seen them around the country where
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's movements to try and change you
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
know the way we portray history and and
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
and if there's uh you know something
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be changed I think a a
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
good vibrant conversation amongst the
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
General Court members is not a bad place
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
to air that
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
out I appreciate that context um I'm
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
going to try to you my two hats here
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
I've got my legislator hat and my
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
historian hat uh and I don't want
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
to you know go into the direction of as
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
I would in a in a class talking about
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know this notion of we shouldn't be
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
rewriting history we're always rewriting
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
history that's actually what historians
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
do it's what they have always done and
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
as I said if we look at the the early
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
the period of The Early Republic and the
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
ways in which the founding fathers
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
effectively rewrote the history of the
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
colonies in order to help establish a
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
new national identity and break away
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
from Great Britain and British
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
Traditions right so the acts of
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
rewriting history are actually literally
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
foundational as you said we don't have
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
statues to King George III anymore uh in
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
terms of being representative um perhaps
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just more jaded I have seen on bills
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
coming before the house for example when
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
we had hearings that had so many people
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
that we did it in Representatives Hall
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
almost every single person would be on
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
one side of a bill and when you look at
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
the online testimony almost every single
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
person is on one side of that bill and
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
it didn't pass that doesn't give me any
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
confidence that when we're talking
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
about some of these really contentious
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
issues that we are are being genuinely
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative I think we can do that
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
better by making administrative
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
processes more responsive because when
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
you talk about representative the other
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
issue for me is we should make it as
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
depoliticized as possible it's not
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
possible to remove it entirely but we
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
should minimize the extent to which
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
things are politicized and and this is a
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
good example and having it voted on by
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
both Chambers to me actually as you said
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
goes in the opposite
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
direction thank you can I follow oh
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative I appreciate that
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
and I certainly seen that same situation
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
but you have to remember just because
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
someone yells loudly does doesn't mean
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
they represent the body and you may have
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
a hundred people that show up and say we
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
don't like this but there may be a
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
thousand more that didn't bother to show
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
up so sometimes what you're getting on
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
that isn't you know on a particular
 
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
topic isn't necessarily representative
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
of the community as a whole but it's
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
those Advocates who are willing to take
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
the time and come there so I mean we we
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
all get many emails and Communications
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
on a lot of different levels and phone
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
calls from from uh different people and
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
I've had some from my own Community who
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
said I email you all the time and you
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
don't vote the way I ask you to and I
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
said well you're just the one person
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
there there's a whole bunch more that
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
emailed me the other way so I'll just
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
remind you that just because you you may
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
see that on a signup sheet that isn't
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily representative of your whole
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
community and I think we are the
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh the elected
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative body of our communities
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
and we are held to that task every two
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
years when we have an election and if
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're not doing a good job we we don't
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
come back that would be my response
 
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.950 align:start position:0%
come back that would be my response
thank

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
chairman um good morning representative
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your comments but um I
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
would argue that history of this country
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
has always been political always you
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
can't hide from that fact in fact you
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
brought up the point about the history
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
of The Early Republic how the founding
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
fathers rewrote the history it wasn't
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
done because they had nothing else to do
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
on a Sunday afternoon they had a
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
political point that they wanted to make
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
they had to position themselves on the
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
world stage
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
but so I I it doesn't bother me about
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
the political aspect of History um but
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
also I'd like to make the point that
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
history belongs to everyone it just
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong to the historians and
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
just so everyone know I am a historian
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
myself um it belongs to the people and
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
the people should have a say in what
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
that history is and how they view it and
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's where they come they come here
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
and they talk about their history their
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
experience and it's up to us as elected
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
officials to sort through and to look at
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
what people are saying and you do have a
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
group of people over here who are just
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
not going to agree and you've got a
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
group of people over here who who agree
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's our job is to walk that fine line
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
in between and try to find compromise
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's messy it's ugly but it
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
has always been that way always and we
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
sorted out that's our job so I don't
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
have a problem with having this done
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
through the general court this is where
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
you want people to come and to have
 
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
those discussions rather than see people
 
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
create a mob out on the street and tear
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
down monuments which we have seen happen
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
in this country time and time again
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Smith I may I
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
respond I want this going back and forth
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay well then I probably don't
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
need to sit here for I'm just going to
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
be spoken at all right okay you can
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
respond no well I mean I mean if I just
 
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.789 align:start position:0%
respond no well I mean I mean if I just
mean

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
that that's okay just consider I mean
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
it's just that there is you know that we
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
are we do have a job to do here we've
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
got okay well my apologies Mr what I
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
mean by that I'll rephrase it is if if
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
we've entered into that phase of the
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
discussion then then I'll I'll sit back
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
down where where input is is not I would
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
I would just I think we're we can
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
we can just make statements and then
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we I would like to get this
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
have a limited amount of time so I'd
 
00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:07.990 align:start position:0%
have a limited amount of time so I'd
like

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
to represent okay I I'll sit back down
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
there okay uh thank you m Mr chair um my
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of points the first
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
point I want to make is is I as far as I
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
am concerned and I have heard nothing
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues um to indicate that
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
anyone disagrees um um until we get to
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
um the amendment I think there's
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
Universal agreement that the bill that
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative ger developed and brought
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh to the house and to the Senate is
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely sound and does something
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's important I I haven't heard
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
anyone say anything else so that means
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're focusing exclusively looking at
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
the side by side on the historical
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
markers point of view
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to get to yes since I've
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
had two other Committees of conference
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm getting tired um and
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
um I want to put something before the
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
group to see what you think about it um
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
having experienced um in great detail
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
significantly more detail than I wanted
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
to experience
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
how the system didn't work in Durham and
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
how it was misused and how the
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
department evidenced no interest at all
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
in anyone's idea of History um it was
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
only people's feelings that were to be
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
considered and I did not think that was
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable if you don't study history
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're condemned to relive it and I
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
truthfully don't want relive it so um
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
but I understand the problems that are
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
raised about
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
expecting uh how do we involve the
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
legislature and so what I'm looking at
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
is what if uh in what is on in the side
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
by side uh going near the end um of the
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
written in regular type um need to
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
obtain information on the the event to
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
be commemorated and on the appropriate
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
location for the mark including
 
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.789 align:start position:0%
location for the mark including
Consulting

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
Consulting
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
historians and holding
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
local public
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
hearings period and getting the public
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
involved at the local level where there
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
is most familiarity with the particular
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
issue getting historians involved and
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
not people who are only worried about
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
touchy feely issues and then stopping at
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
that point and not involving the
 
00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:11.519 align:start position:0%
legislature which among other things um
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
could um delay uh a timely uh action so
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that might be a way to
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
get people to agree but to me I'd like
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
to take a look at can we do this in a
 
00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.190 align:start position:0%
to take a look at can we do this in a
meaningful

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
way and not have the legislature
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
involved but having the local community
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
involved and having historians involved
 
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:50.590 align:start position:0%
involved and having historians involved
thank

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
um so U Back to the bill again um
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
I uh I don't know if anybody else here
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
served on has served on historical
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
Resources Council but I spent a number
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
of years on it and that's the body that
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
actually does the State Highway marker
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
program and approves the language and so
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
on and so forth and uh it's a good
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
process and it does involve a lot of
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
local input because it's usually the
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
local folks who come forward saying they
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
want to have one and there they've done
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of historical research and and so
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
on so I think the council's good um but
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
I agree with Senator Pearl in that you
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
know we are the policymaking body and
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's often um good to know that there is
 
00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:38.909 align:start position:0%
it's often um good to know that there is
um

00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
local public hearings and all that but
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know we we are the we're responsible
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
for directing agencies what what to do
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh I in my years working with
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
with the his Resources Council and with
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
that department I have found usually
 
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
there's a very good Synergy about
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that we set policy and
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
then they then helped find resources to
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
do it um I do have some concerns about
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
the full Bill process it's expensive to
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
file a bill got to go through hearings
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
in both bodies and if it's just that you
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
know one marker got hit by a snowplow
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
which happened in Baron and they then
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
they had to figure out where we're going
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
to put it now is do we want to Bill on
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
that um so that's why I had thought
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
maybe we would uh say C the approval of
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
the of the joint fiscal committee um
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
that's and these these agencies go to
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
Joint fiscal all the time and all kinds
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
of issues not just physcal ones so that
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
would be a way of saying that's head the
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
touch of the legislature and policy um
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
without having to go through a full Bill
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
process so I think that'd be another
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
approach I ask uh Senator Waters a
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
question would that could I ask you a
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
question go right ahead thank you you
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
won't get a good answer I'm sure but
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
I'll try wouldn't ask if I didn't think
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'd get a good answer I wouldn't bother
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
to waste your time or my time I'm
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
interested that you say you've served
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
for many years on that Council because
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
you know so much more about this than I
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
do but my understanding is that one of
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
the major problems that has developed is
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
that um in our wisdom we completely
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
restructured the department and in
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
restructuring the department we brought
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
people together who didn't necessarily
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
have the same background the same
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
experience the same understanding how
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
each of the disperate parts would work
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
and so that is where I mean I know I I
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
went and spoke to the commissioner about
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
the problems she was experiencing trying
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
to get people to work together and so
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
in why that the council that you to
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
which you refer hadn't undergone any
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
growing pains well thanks for the
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
question I I served on it from like
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
think about 2000 2008 um and I've had
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
experience with it since then and
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
getting the uh marker for Hail and Dober
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other historical markers
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
we the one for
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
the the first law enforcement kill on a
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
duty in the state who was a sheriff in
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
barington um getting that one put up and
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
um you know I that was my then
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
experience with the council about
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
getting the wording done and the
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
historical Resources Council which runs
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
this program to do it and it just it
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
just seemed um you know functioning as
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
usual I would not participated in or
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
part of any of the conversations about
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know concerns about renaming or or
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
this or that although I will say at the
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
time um that I was on there there was an
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
effort we
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
have I think we pretty much gone now but
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
back in those in the early 200s it was
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
noted we had an awful lot of place names
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
around the state including in Durham you
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
know and Creek
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
endpoint um n road down in exitor and
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
those those were changed um so you know
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
the process goes on but I I'm just
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
saying that I think on senat in the
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
recent yeah the council's still there I
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
know the counil is but yeah but I the
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
administrative and management stuff yeah
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
I understand that but as far as this
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
goes and I would say this is my point
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
though is that I I see the logic of
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
having a legislative touch just how we
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
issue thank you Mr chairman
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
um I I heaven forbid 20 years in the
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
house and I'm finally disagreeing with
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
my friend from Madbury
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um uh well they no longer serve in the
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
house but I'll tell you later no you
 
00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.790 align:start position:0%
house but I'll tell you later no you
madam

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
madam
 
00:34:53.419 --> 00:34:53.429 align:start position:0%
CH oh
 
00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.669 align:start position:0%
CH oh
[Music]

00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
I'm motion to a jour
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
oh my God MIAA Mia Mia
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
Maxima um no no no no there a separation
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
State you didn't have an Irish
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
mother there is no separation um let let
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
me get us back on track by simply saying
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
I just wonder about us passing any
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to have a local community do
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
something if it could bring up a 91a
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
issue that's my concern there I like the
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
idea of having a joint commit of the
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
legislature looking at this but I don't
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be fiscal and um uh
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
again I think the underlying Bill we all
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
agree on that's good legislation and I
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of memorials here in
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
conet that have been completely
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
overlooked and one up at the airport
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated to a World War One flyer by
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
name of Bo Clair CLA is completely
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
covered with Shrubbery now you can't
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
even see the marker so I think that's a
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful point I did read the NPR
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
article about uh the um the in with the
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
story on Oyster River Massacre and how
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's gone all around and who's
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
involved and what what town was that in
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh that was in the beautiful town of
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
Durham River in the town of O River my
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
friend um maybe I'm going mad that's how
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
mad came up but anyway I do think we
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
should look at an alternative to have a
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
disinterested third party look at what a
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
local community is doing sometimes a
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
minority in some communities can have a
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
louder voice than the majority does and
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
things kind of go along so I do uh
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
support that idea of a third party thank
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Mr chairman um I had
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
thought about this we do have the joint
 
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.550 align:start position:0%
thought about this we do have the joint
historical

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
committee um here um Senator Waters is
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
it myself does
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
have yeah but at least it would be the
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislature um and we have done the
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
marker for Lafayette and hanging
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
portraits in the State House the State
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
House complex there is some experience
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
there as opposed to
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal just just an idea we have to
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
amend we'd have to amend the duties of
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah we probably would we probably
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
have he said we'd probably have to amend
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
the duties of the joint historical
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
commission I would be very awkward to
 
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
add something like this to that
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee because that's it's the state
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
house yeah it's run it does the State
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
House they consult with excuse me if I
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
may Mr they could you know I if I if I
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
join fiscal and this came in the
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
department you know the commissioner
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
came in said here's some here's a
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
proposal we have and I you know so maybe
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
Joor some familiar with
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
the which gives the joint fiscal
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
committee powers and I don't see how
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
this would
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
to would have those Powers would have to
 
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.109 align:start position:0%
to would have those Powers would have to
be

00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
amended uh if I may um I think that they
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't because uh anything they do
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
involves spending a little money and uh
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of things that end up
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
being policy wise that we do we do have
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal I mean i' we've done a
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
couple bills this year that have a do a
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
little pit stop at joint fiscal um and
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
it's so anyways I I do think it's it's
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
just a quick question um would fiscal
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
have the ability for um handling
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
anything that deals with uh rewriting um
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
I understand the the money aspect of
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal but I can't see them um from a
 
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
fiscal but I can't see them um from a
historical

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint handling uh a rewrite or yeah
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
if I if I may Mr so I I would my sense
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
would be that the commissioner would
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
come in say here's what we're going to
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
do join fiscal would hear about it they
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
they might say we're not happy with that
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
language go back and come bring us
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
something back oh because I I don't want
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
to sit there and word s no I you imagine
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
me and English Professor sitting there
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
and trying to you do you want to scream
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
for the exits but I I think they would
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
just say we're not happy with this here
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
we the first off the
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
law written is it's marking the location
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
of public and historic incidents an
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
incident can't you know we hear about
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
context no it's not about an incident is
 
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.829 align:start position:0%
context no it's not about an incident is
what

00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
happened it's not about the con context
 
00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
happened it's not about the con context
of

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
it if you go to the uh Arizona under the
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh that's under Pearl Harbor I don't
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
think there's an area about the context
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
Japanese it's about here's what
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
happened and it's when these things that
 
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.349 align:start position:0%
happened and it's when these things that
start

00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
changing or people or we start
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh making adjustments to history based
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
on people's feelings or Pap or on
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
context context go to a book and read
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
about but the mo the
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh the these monuments
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
are describe the incident that's that
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.550 align:start position:0%
 
stand

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
stand
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative yeah sorry about former
 
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.589 align:start position:0%
representative yeah sorry about former
represent

00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah being being a chair of house
 
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
yeah being being a chair of house
committee

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
everybody's Senator Pearl so I'm I'm
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
listening to the debate and all the
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
discussion and I certainly appreciate
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
the representative position that he
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
brought up and I mean it it is kind of
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
an arduous task at times to put a bill
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
all the way through nobody's going to
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
argue that point perhaps an alternative
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
would be just to push it have the
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
executive counsel approve it that way
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
you're staying within the uh
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
administrative uh Department as well you
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of an oversight that
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
would would stay it isn't us the
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislature but it's giving some
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
oversight maybe that would be a a better
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
position it's only let them do the word
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
SM if they need to they certainly work
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
with language and finances as
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
well I don't know any thoughts on that
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman I I I mean that's
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
that can be cumbersome too but it is a
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
lot of things go to the executive
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
Council that's that's true get it put on
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
our agenda uh we would lose the
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight but maybe that's
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's good um but either either
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
way I I think the basic core principle
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
that I understood being brought forward
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
you know for Myers re Hill and with you
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
Senator has been that um you know we're
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
elected to uh have a have a look at
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
things and to set policy and since it
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
does seem some people have felt that
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
some decision have gotten into policy
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
areas then that's an argument for having
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
it have its
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
little you know kind of pause uh in the
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
on the legislative branch rather than
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
executive I I do think joint FAL work I
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
think be very efficient and easy to do
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we're legislators we know people
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
en jooin physical we see something come
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
up on the agenda we have a concern about
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
we talk to our members on it and um
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
offer them some insights and that's the
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
way we do
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
things continuing continuing to try to
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
get to yes and do nothing to uh in any
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
way uh dilute the the value of the
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um could we why don't we
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
do what we've done in any number of
 
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
situations and actually
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
create a joint
 
00:43:23.319 --> 00:43:25.829 align:start position:0%
create a joint
committee

00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
charged with
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing these decisions and it would
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
have a few members of the house a few
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate and following
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
tradition and Rule um the membership
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
would uh likely roughly reflect the
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
partisan membership of each of the house
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
and the Senate I mean you had seven
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
members on the committee for example um
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
and that committee uh you don't have to
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
have a a a bill you don't have to go
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
through that whole process that
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
committee could review any um decisions
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
that have been made either any decisions
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
that have been made or decisions that
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
have been um
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
challenged uh and it would not involve
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
the entire legislature but it would
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
involve um it would involve some
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislators and we've done that in I
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
mean I don't have my blackbook with me
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
but um you know you could just look at
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
the blackbook and see how many
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
committees we've formed to do just that
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
um and I wonder if that gives us a
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
chance to have our cake and eat it
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
too Mr chairman I I think that goes
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
beyond the what we can do as a committee
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
of conference because
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
it either from either body so here here
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
would be a suggestion i' make I like the
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
idea how about if we push the effective
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
date out until
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
middle of next year July one and you can
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
put a bill in next fall and we or
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
someone can whoever's here and have we
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
can have that discussion and put that
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and if
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
we aren't successful then this will take
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
effect so if I may u Senator you're the
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
effective date push it out just for the
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill correct okay so
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
we'd have two effective dates in the
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
bill one and one for only only for this
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
section yes
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I think also the gentleman from
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
maybe not that I got the right the right
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
to remain silent I'm going to use the
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment um this was a suggestion
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
by somebody else but
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
they thought that possibly The Joint
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
facilities committee could be the
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this and just vote
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
up or down on a
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
proposal and so I'll off that I think
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
that's the same if I may Mr it's the
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
same problem that ID that was identified
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
with the joint historical you have to
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
change their I I I think what Senator
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
Pearl um suggested is workable that we
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
have an effective date for the first
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
part push the second part out to give
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
time for legis the legislation to be
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
filed that's going to give us a longer
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
time to look at it and come up with some
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a solution so basically we're
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
dividing the bill yeah you're basically
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
and just and give time for the
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
legislative process and hopefully we can
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
get there yeah so it would be section
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
three effective date of section
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
one yeah is 60 days after passage and
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
then there' be a section
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
four effective dat of July 1st
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
2025 that's fine I I just wonder section
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
two you mean yeah yeah well but do you
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
have to have a the effective number four
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
is number four would be the second well
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
they can't have two effective dates yes
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
you can have two that's way you
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
effective date for for part X and then
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
respect dat for part y but we don't need
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
a section four we can I where they do it
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I think before you go too far
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
down that path um I I am concerned that
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
what we would be doing would be kicking
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
the can down the road the bill the bill
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
everyone knows um has the possib ility
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
of being derailed anywhere along in this
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
process and we could go years before we
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually do something um so I I'd like
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
to suggest um we even we either um jump
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
into changing this language that we have
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
the ability to do today by selecting who
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
would have this oversight with the idea
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
that future legislation could be um
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
could be built to build this this
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
special committee that would do this but
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we have have something being
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
worked on that's obviously an issue um
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
currently um that would be that would be
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
my hope rather than moving the effective
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
data on one section or the other um just
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
simply maybe even choose uh joint fiscal
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
to look at it now and then the new
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
legislation could U that is proposed
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
could change it later on if I may Mr
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
chairman I I I just think that I I more
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
talk I think we can work on something
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
next year right now if we did join fisal
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
we could be done we'd have a vehicle
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
that respects the intent of the of the
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment We'd have the
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
legisl involved and it be a process that
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think could be effici and uh maybe in
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
a year from now we've got something else
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
but for now I think we'd have a
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
Bill hey and this is not the cannabis
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
bill okay no I can with that although
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a museum of cannabis
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
in Portland r
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
not that I go into these things but can
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
I ask you a question of the chair Mr
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
chairman could I move to divide this
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill because I think we all in agreement
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
the first part of the bill is good we
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
think there should be a study of
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
monuments divide the bill vote on that
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
and then take up uh uh Senator water's
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the second part so
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we they could stand
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
alone it's all or nothing all okay well
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
so much for that brilliant idea it's
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
okay one more and I'm out
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
I I would be fully amenable to changing
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
it to Joint fiscal I have no issue with
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
that I think that serves what the point
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
that we're having some and then we can
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about a different
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
Bill another time yeah I just have to
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
ask how many people sitting in this
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
table are hoping to be
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
back you don't have to answer yeah most
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
of I hope
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
so okay well I'm not it's all right okay
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
come back to the
 
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.069 align:start position:0%
come back to the
light

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
she's would everybody ation I can
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
approach yeah I'm fine either way I I
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
see the merits of hisor but I'm fine
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
either way so if I may so we're looking
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
at language that would begin on line 28
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
it says resources I'll secure the
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
approval of the general court through
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
the joint fiscal committee period 23
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I said 23 28 I'm sorry 20 I
 
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.510 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I said 23 28 I'm sorry 20 I
don't

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
have it's in the same I I think um if
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
you may Mr chair I think that whether we
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
would say just through the joint fiscal
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
Committee of the general court I mean I
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
think that's OS that might tell you how
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
to do that rather than the general it's
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
Pro of the general court through the
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
joint physical committee I don't know
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
how that should be phrased well I think
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
that it's the spirit of it yeah so
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
however all say that should be done my
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
question is is the do we have to do we
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
have to change the laws around I don't
 
00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:16.799 align:start position:0%
Comm I don't think so no that's no no no
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of flexib have a lot of
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't think you do I think they're
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
okay I serve on joint fiscal as a um as
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
a alter I I'm pretty sure we could do it
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
s like other duties so
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
assigned and and they would have the
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
approval or disapproval or um do they
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
then have to get approval from the
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
general court no
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
general I we could do that get the bill
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
passed satisfy the goals of the Senate
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
satisfi the goals of the House and
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
Senate which uh is the underlying Bill
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
and then um we can come in with a bill
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
right we we we could file a request for
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
a bill in September um to do to handle
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
it in a different way but meanwhile I'd
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
probably even Co with you when you fil
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
well that would be terrific all I have
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
to do last have to find out if I'm going
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
primary I'll let you know so everybody
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
be good with that so the official the
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
official wording is I think we would say
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
the approval of the joint legislative
 
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.670 align:start position:0%
the approval of the joint legislative
fiscal

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee I think that's the the
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
language and I don't think we need to
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
reference General Court okay yeah okay I
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
just looked it up so do does does that
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee take testimony from the public
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
lots of it sometimes right Howard it
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
does okay basically it would be changing
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
the changing the amendment to before
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
amending or permanently removing any
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
marker is
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of the Department
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
of Natural and cultural resources shall
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
should shall secure the approval of the
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal joint legislative fiscal
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee period that's it period that's
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
it period yeah would anybody agree to
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
adding the word local to public hearings
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
or do you think that that I think
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're welcomed regardless that's why I
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
asked the question they would be it's
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
