representatives
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to remind myself every time i'm
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
in this hall that the five gentlemen on
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
the wall behind me knew nothing about my
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
existence when the things they did were
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
so important nor did anybody else in
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
this hall
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
and that they will be here long after i
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
am here debating the the issues of the
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
day but what they are here for is for
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
um the principles and the things that
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
drive us and get us here together to
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
have the discussion we're going to have
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
here this morning so i always like to
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
sort of pay a little special attention
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
to them because what they did help us do
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
was sort of chart the way as to how we
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
would proceed and this is state business
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
um and in that regards i would like to
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
start the meeting this morning with the
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much everyone
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have a seat we are live
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
streaming this um i want to make sure
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
that people who are watching and there
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
were like two people logged in an hour
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
before we even began
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i want to make sure that everyone can
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
hear what is going on so this mic is on
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
to my right and left are members of
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee they are here
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
with me today for this public input
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
session on maps
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
as you all know we are here for
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
redistricting this is a event that
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
occurs throughout the country in every
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
state after the census is completed we
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
have been to each county throughout the
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
state for a public information
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
session so that we can get input as to
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
what the various communities in our
 
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.629 align:start position:0%
what the various communities in our
counties

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
might have for thoughts as to how we
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
should proceed with maps
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
since those information sensors sessions
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have drafted maps as a committee
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
those were posted online last week and
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you came in today and had an
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see the table we have
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
copies for you
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
so you have something in front of you
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
today to look at so we are here today
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
and tomorrow at five o'clock
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
to hear your input on
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
the maps that are proposed there are two
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
maps proposed for every district
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the things that we are focused on on our
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee are commissioners which are
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
elected by county
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
house representatives again elected by
 
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
house representatives again elected by
county

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
and the congressional districts
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
which are elected by two counties
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
through two divisions one division two
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the state
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
i have a blue sheet out front for people
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
to sign up if they'd like to speak this
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
is how we handled it in the public
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
information session sessions and it
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
seemed to work all right my purpose i'm
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
simply going to go through
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
the list here and ask people to come to
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
one of the microphones it is my
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that each of these
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
microphones are on
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
so you will be able to be heard not only
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
by people here in the chamber with you
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
but also by people who are looking
 
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.590 align:start position:0%
but also by people who are looking
online

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.470 align:start position:0%
online
so

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
with that i would like to get started
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
i will note that there we have
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
designated sections four and five for
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
face covering so if you would be more
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable sitting in an area where
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
everyone around you will have a face
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
covering on i invite you to move to
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
section four or five of the hall
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
i've sat in a number of seats you get a
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
good view everywhere so
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
feel free to move
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to start out we have a
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
number of people here it is not my
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
intent to limit the time for testimony
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we do testimony we limit
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
it to three minutes
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
uh as representatives when we go to
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as the well behind me
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
to my right and my left
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
what we are told is after three minutes
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh you need to get your point across or
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
or people are not following it
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee will certainly
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
be following you but i'm not going to be
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
cutting people off unless i think it's
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
getting really repetitive or we get a
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
significantly more amount of people in
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
here and i'm worried about people being
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
able to speak if people come and they
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
want to speak i want to make sure we can
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
hear them
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to start and the
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
first person who signed up
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
is janet ward janet ms ward where are
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
you welcome ms word miss ward i and i
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
won't do this for everybody but i will
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
give her honorable mention she came to a
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
community input session she has written
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
the committee and i think we just got an
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
email yesterday from this ward yes
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
indeed you did
 
00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.230 align:start position:0%
indeed you did
welcome

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
um so the united states supreme court
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
can you get a little closer certainly
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
the united states supreme court observed
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
that the process of redistricting which
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
often involves gerrymandering
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a political process
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and that it would not become involved in
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
that process
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
this was a bad decision on the part of
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
the supreme court why
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
because the purely political
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
act of gerrymandering
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
effectively silences the voices
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
of legitimate voters
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
and makes it impossible for voters to
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
have their votes truly count
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
the fact is
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
that gerrymandering
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
turns democracy on its head
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
it enables candidates to choose their
 
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
it enables candidates to choose their
voters

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
and denies voters the right to choose
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
their candidates
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee understands
 
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.030 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee understands
that

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
any reasonable person who has looked at
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
the republican map
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
of u.s congressional district 1 and
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
congressional district 2
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
can see that its convoluted borders
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
serve one purpose and one purpose only
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
as drawn
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
this map lets republican candidates
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
running in district 1
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
select their voters
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
while district 2
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
lets democratic candidates choose theirs
 
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.590 align:start position:0%
lets democratic candidates choose theirs
yes

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
voters will cast their votes in these
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
districts but the outcome is
 
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.269 align:start position:0%
districts but the outcome is
predetermined

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
predetermined
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
in these packed
 
00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
in these packed
cracked

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
cracked
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
purposely and artfully drawn
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered districts
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
what the republican members of the
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
special committee on redistricting have
 
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
special committee on redistricting have
done

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
is to silence the voices of voters
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
democrats republicans and independents
 
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.430 align:start position:0%
democrats republicans and independents
alike

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
alike
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is a display of raw political power
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
and it is wrong
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
what good is an election if
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering makes it essentially
 
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering makes it essentially
meaningless

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
meaningless
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to thank the committee for
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak before you
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
and to convey my concerns with the
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
proposed map for the redistricting of
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
state legislative representatives in new
 
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
state legislative representatives in new
hampshire

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm from the town of deerfield where
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
this past spring by a margin of more
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
than two to one
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
voters vote
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
more than two to one voters voted their
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
desire for this committee to minimize
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
multi-seat districts
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not originally from new hampshire
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
but i did spend all my childhood summers
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and went to college here
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
i love new hampshire as my second home
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
and i chose to come back here to new
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire after working for several
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
years in other states
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
i wanted to raise my children here
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
in part because of the quality of life
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
that i believe existed for myself and my
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
family in new hampshire
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
coming back here as an adult i knew that
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
there were two very particular things
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
that defined new hampshire and its
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
approach to policy and politics
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and those two things were the state
 
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
and those two things were the state
motto

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
motto
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
live free or die
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
and the governing concept of local
 
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
and the governing concept of local
control

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
these are more than slogans they were
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
part of what makes new hampshire unique
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
live for your dive to me meant
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
maintaining a limited role for
 
00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
maintaining a limited role for
government

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
to not have unnecessary governmental
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
influence in people's lives as they make
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
a life for themselves and their families
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
but it also communicates how vitally
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
important this state considers freedom
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
and a democratic system of government to
 
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
and a democratic system of government to
be

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
included in that value of freedom is the
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
right to have one's voice heard
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
local control meant that the citizens of
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
new hampshire have a close relationship
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
too and could have a direct impact on
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
how their communities are run
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
they would know who was making the
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
decisions on their behalf and could
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
communicate easily with policy makers
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
because they were members of the same
 
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
because they were members of the same
community

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
and in the last 26 years of living here
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
i have heard these principles cited over
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
and over again by policy makers as the
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
rationale for many a piece of
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
legislation or other
 
00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
legislation or other
policy

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
in looking at the proposed maps for
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
state legislative districts i scratch my
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
head and wonder where these two vitally
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire concepts have gone
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
i attended more than one of the public
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
hearings held by this committee in the
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
counties across the state
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
and what i heard from many people across
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
many many towns
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
was the desire to have their communities
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
be represented by a single state
 
00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:21.509 align:start position:0%
be represented by a single state
representative

00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
again and again
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
it was said that the ability for a town
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
to choose who represents them in the
 
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.110 align:start position:0%
to choose who represents them in the
legislature

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
without their vote being diluted or
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
skewed by voters in an adjoining town or
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
towns was a priority
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
having someone who truly knows your
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
community and its unique needs and
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
concerns as laws and policies are
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
crafted here in this building is
 
00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:47.509 align:start position:0%
crafted here in this building is
invaluable

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
invaluable
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
and allows for the local voice to be
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
part of the process
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
it is consistent with the concept and
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
the values of local control
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
the continued use of multi-town
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
districts when towns clearly desire and
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
the state constitution supports the
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
critical value that town-specific
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
representation provides is disheartening
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
particularly when these proposed
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
districts have the same number of
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
representatives as the number of towns
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so there's no rationale the rationale
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
re restrictions needed in the number of
 
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:27.429 align:start position:0%
re restrictions needed in the number of
representatives

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
multi-town districts reduce the voices
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
of voters and because that because of
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
that they weaken the democratic
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
underpinnings of our government
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
they should not be used in or they
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
should be used only in situations where
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
the numbers make them unavoidable
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
the maps is currently proposed feel very
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
much like unnecessary governmental
 
00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
much like unnecessary governmental
influence

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
influence
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
if the voices of the people are not
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
heard then we are not truly free and our
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
state motto live free or die has been
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
gutted what we have lost was what makes
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire new hampshire
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
i attended the special committee work
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
sessions on number on november 3rd
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
let me make sure i'm on the beginning
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
yes on november 3rd and 4th when these
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
maps were first presented
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
i want to begin by saying that i
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time and effort the
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
committee has spent to make sure that
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
the maps could meet the constitutional
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
and state requirements and i especially
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
want to thank the committee for this
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to now speak about the
 
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.710 align:start position:0%
opportunity to now speak about the
proposals

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
i sincerely hope that you will take my
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
comments and the comments of other
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
granite staters into consideration
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
before you finalize your decisions
 
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
before you finalize your decisions
first

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
could you just state what uh town you're
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
from it makes it easier for us thank you
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
first i want to raise my heart the
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
this republican plan would destroy the
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
competitive congressional districts in
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
i went back and reviewed the voting
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
records for both districts for the past
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
140 years
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
both district 1 and district 2 have
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
historically swung between republican
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
representation and democratic
 
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.070 align:start position:0%
representation and democratic
representation

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
this has been a good thing
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
we want our districts to be competitive
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
competitive districts help unify our
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
state as candidates must appeal to
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
voters with diverse ideas
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
competitive districts also bring about
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
the very best candidates
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
the map the
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
map created by republicans would not
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
only transfer 75 towns in the state to a
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
new district but would create two highly
 
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.710 align:start position:0%
new district but would create two highly
partisan

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
clearly gerrymandered districts
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
the majorities map transfers the key
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
republican leaning districts of hudson
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
salem and windham to district one while
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
at the same time shifting democratic
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
leaning dover in durham from
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
congressional district one to district
 
00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:35.669 align:start position:0%
congressional district one to district
2.

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
2.
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that the members of this
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
committee will lose credibility if they
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
do not modify the majority congressional
 
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.789 align:start position:0%
do not modify the majority congressional
plan

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
fair non-partisan redistricting is
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
popular with voter voters and these
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
hearings are being watched closely
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
i recommend using the nonpartisan map
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
drawn by the citizen mapping project
 
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
drawn by the citizen mapping project
mapathon

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
mapathon
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
this map maintains integrity competitive
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
districts and keeps communities of
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
interest together
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
i also support the minority map
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
democratic members of the committee
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
succeeded in maintaining competitive
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
districts and did not need to move huge
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
numbers of voters into new districts to
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
comply with the constitutional and state
 
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
comply with the constitutional and state
rules

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
as a carroll county resident i would
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
also like to comment on the proposed
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
house plans
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
i acknowledge how complex this process
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
is for creating these districts
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
both the democratic and republican plans
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
have advantages and are similar in every
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
in many ways
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
however i prefer the democratic plan
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
which creates smaller districts i
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
believe that the smaller districts make
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
it easier for our representatives to
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
know their communities and i also think
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
more candidates would run for house if
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
the districts were smaller as the
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
campaigns would not be so expensive
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
my first choice for a carroll county map
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
is reserved for mapathon a map that
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
places tamworth madison freedom
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
effingham and eaton together
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
even though the
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the deviations are lower under this
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
plan and the map maintains smaller
 
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.630 align:start position:0%
plan and the map maintains smaller
districts

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
groups communities of interest together
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
and helps more qualifying towns have
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
their own representative
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
um chair i was given a very short
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%

and it's to the new hampshire house
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee members
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
she writes i am outraged after reviewing
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
material on the proposed republican
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting changes for new hampshire
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the cradle of american
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
democracy let us not defile this
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
deep-rooted tradition through partisan
 
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
deep-rooted tradition through partisan
rancor

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
rancor
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%

they will collate and they will be
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
scanned and emailed to the com
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
because obviously we don't expect you
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
all to bring multiple copies so we thank
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
the people that did
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
the next person signed up to speak is
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
hi uh first thank you
 
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.190 align:start position:0%
hi uh first thank you
for

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
the time you have put in i can't imagine
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
how hard it was to do the state rep
 
00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:00.789 align:start position:0%
how hard it was to do the state rep
districts

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
however what i'm here to talk about is
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
northeast rockingham county okay
 
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
northeast rockingham county okay
so

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
basically what i'm going to even though
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
i know how difficult it is and i do
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand some of the issues
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like the committee members to
 
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:19.190 align:start position:0%
i'd like the committee members to
reconsider

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
reconsider
the

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
towns of deerfield northwood nottingham
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
candia and auburn
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
i have to speak through the mask
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh the five towns of deerfield
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
northwood nottingham candia and auburn
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
each has the population for its own rep
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
but instead they are combined in either
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
one of the plans here in two towns and
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
three towns the other swaps deerfield
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
back and forth between the two districts
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you to reconsider but i
 
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.830 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you to reconsider but i
understand

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
understand
that

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
you've worked on this forever so instead
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak specifically to the
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
way the plans were made
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
right now the majority plan says
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
deerfield auburn
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
and candia
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
the minority plan says deerfield
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
northwood in nottingham
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
if the towns have to be combined
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate you really looking at
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
what the towns have in common
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
deerfield northwood and nottingham have
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
the same state rep excuse me state
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
senate district
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
candy and auburn are in a different
 
00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
candy and auburn are in a different
district

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
candy and auburn send their kids to
 
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.789 align:start position:0%
candy and auburn send their kids to

elected a person from candia
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
since in almost 10 years because it's
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
the smallest town in both plans
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%

none of our towns other than northwood

deerfield is half in northwood

so if these towns cannot be given their

own representatives
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
i would really appreciate your
 
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.269 align:start position:0%
i would really appreciate your
consideration

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
what the towns have in common
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
communities of interest make a
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
difference deerfield and nottingham at
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
one point were the same community so
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of historic and cultural
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
things that happen together
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time i have a handout
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.350 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time i have a handout
and

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
part of the handout which i will give to
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
looks at the data
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the standard
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
deviations for both the majority and the
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
minority plan
 
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.149 align:start position:0%
minority plan
are

00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
basically much narrower
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
than the standard deviation for
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
rockingham county which is plus and
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
minus five
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
if deerfield can now have its own rep
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
i would much prefer
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the people of deerfield and as
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
maureen quinn said
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly have asked for their own
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
rep if deerfield cannot have its own rep
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
then please consider putting deerfield
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
with northwood in nottingham which
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
culturally historically educationally
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
has much more in common
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
than deerfield with either
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair members

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.870 align:start position:0%

milford
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to speak in support of the
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
minority plan
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
that puts milford and amherst in the
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
same floateria district
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
it makes perfect sense from a historical
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
geographic cultural
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
and social perspective
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
milford and amherst are like two peas in
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
the pod
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're twin sisters with a very long
 
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
they're twin sisters with a very long
shared

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%

history
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
milford was once part of amherst before
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
becoming its own town
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
in more recent times amherst students
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
attended high school at the milford area
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
senior high school before souhegan high
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
school was built
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
my children played and now my
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
granddaughter plays with kids from
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
amherst on various youth sports programs
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
kids from amherst participate in the
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
boys and girls club
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
in milford
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
residents of amherst are parishioners at
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
st patrick's church
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
in milford
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
the minority plan
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
would put milford
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
in with brookline
 
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.630 align:start position:0%
in with brookline
greenville

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
greenville

mason mount vernon new ipswich temple
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
and wilton
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make any sense
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
it's a 20-minute walk
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
a three-minute car ride from the milford
 
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.909 align:start position:0%
a three-minute car ride from the milford
oval

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
oval
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
to the amherst border
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
it is a 20-minute car ride
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
a four-hour walk from the milford oval
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
conversely the majority plan puts
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
amherst with hollis
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
but the minority plan
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
has hollis with brookline
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
now that makes sense
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
because hollis brookline
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
share the same school district
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
hollis brookline high school
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
so from my perspective this really is a
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
representatives coming from the
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
community that they know
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that the representative
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
could live in amherst and attend church
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
in milford
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
or that the representative could come
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
from milford
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
and their children play on the soccer
 
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.630 align:start position:0%
and their children play on the soccer
team

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
team
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
in amherst
 
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.230 align:start position:0%
in amherst
so

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
i just asked for your consideration with
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
that full turial to combine the combined
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%

00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%

we share
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
representing plainfield cornish grantham
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
and springfield and we also share in the

first i want to register my constituents
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelming opposition to the flagrant

gerrymandering of our congressional

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
but i want to focus my remarks here
 
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.190 align:start position:0%
but i want to focus my remarks here
today

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
on my own district
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
i strongly urge the redistricting
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
committee to reject the majority map
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
with its proposed severing of the
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
current district one into several
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
fragmented units
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
cornish and plainfield in particular are
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
integrally interwoven and must not be
 
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.310 align:start position:0%
integrally interwoven and must not be
separated

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
separated
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
the two share commercial establishments
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
electronic and print media
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
they have interwoven neighborhoods and
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
innumerable roads and bridges in common
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
they provide each other with police and
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
fire backup
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%

superintendent
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
we share each other's libraries we
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
combine our town energy committees we
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
have an aging in place group which
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
provides resources and services across
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%

communities and share many issues from
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
bank erosion and flooding to public
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%

00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
other towns have any interest or concern
 
00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.029 align:start position:0%
other towns have any interest or concern
in

00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
when severe bank erosion threatened the
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
integrity of route 12a and the viability
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
of commercial establishments in both
 
00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.029 align:start position:0%

district one's shared representatives
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
were able to effectively advocate for
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
alterations in the department of
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
transportation's plans
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
when speeding issues threatened lives
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
and safety on route 120 again we were
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
able to bring twice the influence
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
more than just one rep's voice to bear
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
in search of solutions for our
 
00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.430 align:start position:0%
in search of solutions for our
constituents

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
please contrast this with the majorities
 
00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:20.710 align:start position:0%
please contrast this with the majorities
map

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
which takes plainfield and puts it in
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
one district takes cornish and puts it
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
in another district and then links the
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
two towns with two towns with which they
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
have nothing in common
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
according to the majorities map there is
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
a contiguous area between plainfield and
 
00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:40.950 align:start position:0%
a contiguous area between plainfield and
croydon

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
croydon
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
in fact this doesn't exist there's a
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
private game reserve on that mountain
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it has cut off any communication you
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
cannot hike to croydon you certainly
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
cannot drive a car to croydon without
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
going out of the town and around on the
 
00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:03.349 align:start position:0%
going out of the town and around on the
interstate

00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
the majority map gives a false
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
impression that this is a fairly large
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
area it's about four or five hundred
 
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
area it's about four or five hundred
feet

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
a similar thing happens to cornish with
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
their link to newport it's a theoretical
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
point but there's no road there there's
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
no contiguity to go from cornish to
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
newport you have to go down to claremont
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
drive east and then go north again
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
to reach that area there are no
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
administrative social historic
 
00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.950 align:start position:0%
administrative social historic
geographic

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
geographic
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
church rescue police ties between these
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
communities they do not share a
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
commonality of interest
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
so i please ask you to reconsider this
 
00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
so i please ask you to reconsider this
glaring

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
glaring
 
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.190 align:start position:0%
glaring
injustice

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
injustice
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
your gis maps may show a croydon
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
mountain road that goes over the
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
mountain but it's long since
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
not been able to be used
 
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.510 align:start position:0%
not been able to be used
um

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay and i would just leave you with
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
this thought
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
please leave district 1 in its current
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
configuration it works well and i've
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
heard no complaints from any
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
of my constituents on of either partisan
 
00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:12.870 align:start position:0%
of my constituents on of either partisan
configuration

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
configuration
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.030 align:start position:0%
uh the
so

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
my the first the first ask is leave it
 
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
my the first the first ask is leave it
alone

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
and my second ask is please adopt the
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
minority map which would keep playing
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
field and cornish together
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
present testimony my name is liz
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
tentarelli i live in newberry
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
the westernmost town in merrimack county
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
among new hampshire's 239
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
populated cities and towns fewer than
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.910 align:start position:0%
populated cities and towns fewer than
half

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
half
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
are large enough to qualify for their
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
own state representatives
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
so today i want to address the situation
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
of the 135
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
small towns with populations under that
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
target number
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
and many of them including my town of
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
newbury are never going to reach that
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
target number
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
of having our own rep
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
one of the joys of living in a small
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
town is knowing your elected officials
 
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.430 align:start position:0%
town is knowing your elected officials
personally

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
seeing them at town events at the
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
transfer station a kind of neighbor to
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
neighbor relationship
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i won't try to speak for anyone else
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
but many of us consider our
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
representatives political party
 
00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
representatives political party
affiliation

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
less important than what they are doing
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
in the town
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
now in our huge house of representatives
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
called a citizen legislature for good
 
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.950 align:start position:0%
called a citizen legislature for good
reason

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
most of uh most of the representatives
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
are coming from larger towns and cities
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know mathematically that happens
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
but even our large cities have tried to
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
maintain a feeling of localized
 
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.390 align:start position:0%
maintain a feeling of localized
representation

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
by dividing themselves into wards
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that with a small number of
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
representatives from each ward
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
the interests of the neighborhoods in
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
each ward will be considered at the
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
the problem for small towns is that when
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
they are grouped into large multi-seat
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
districts with a number of other towns
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
we lose our connection to localized
 
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.230 align:start position:0%
we lose our connection to localized
representation

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
now none of us expect that we're going
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
to have a rep from our own town each
 
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.870 align:start position:0%
to have a rep from our own town each
time

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
but we do want and hope that this
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
committee will facilitate a plan
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
that groups just a few contiguous towns
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
into a district
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
whose representatives will know the
 
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.390 align:start position:0%
whose representatives will know the
concerns

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
and interests of the issues in all of
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
those towns
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
what we do not want to see is four or
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
five or more towns grouped with a much
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
larger town
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
where the candidates from that much
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
larger town can easily dominate an
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
election just by having an address in
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
that large town
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
this happened with the 2001
 
00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:43.349 align:start position:0%
this happened with the 2001
redistricting

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
and it was so bad that that had to be
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
redone before the next election
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
it also led to the constitutional
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment of 2006
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
that made floaterials official
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
but also called for those towns that
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
meet the threshold of for representation
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
to be allotted their own maps
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
and of course we know that's not always
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
possible i applaud your efforts to do
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
that as much as you can
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
with both the minority and the majority
 
00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
with both the minority and the majority
maps

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
but let's get back to the small towns
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
like mine that don't qualify
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
we too were considered in that
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
2006 amendment
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
even though it's rarely mentioned now
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
so attached to my written testimony is a
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
page from the house election law
 
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.390 align:start position:0%
page from the house election law
committee

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
dated february 22nd 2006.
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is the statement of intent
 
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.670 align:start position:0%
it is the statement of intent
of

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
cacr4 and that's the proposal
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
that was recommended unanimously by the
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee passed in the house and senate
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then passed by the voters
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
in november of 2006
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
with more than a 70
 
00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:01.750 align:start position:0%
with more than a 70
support

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to read that statement of
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
intent because i think it is very
 
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.349 align:start position:0%
intent because i think it is very
important

00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
the long-standing tradition in new
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire is to have
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
as many small representative districts
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
so as to best represent all the people
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
this cacr as amended will allow the
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to use floateral districts
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
as used in the past without question or
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
challenges in the courts
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
this will make sure that our state will
 
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.030 align:start position:0%
this will make sure that our state will
have

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
as many small house districts as
 
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:40.069 align:start position:0%
as many small house districts as
possible

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
now of course the amendment the
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
the actual amendment has passed deals
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
with those towns that reach the
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
threshold for their own representative
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
but that statement of intent applies to
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
the smaller than currently 139 smaller
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
towns as well
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking the committee to look at
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
each of the proposed house maps
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
find and recommend those that have as
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
many small representative districts as
 
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.430 align:start position:0%
many small representative districts as
possible

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that the new maps will best represent
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
i personally could tolerate a larger
 
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.550 align:start position:0%
i personally could tolerate a larger
deviation

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
in order to get that kind of localized
 
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
in order to get that kind of localized
representation

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
i got specific about four counties my
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
own county of merrimack of course
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
carroll county cheshire county and
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
sullivan county with some specific
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
comments that deal with the small towns
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
those not eligible for their own rep and
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
that is in my written testimony and i
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
hope you will look at that when you get
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
to your deliberations next week thank
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you

um
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
i was also speaking in

in a stafford county
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
courthouse when this committee met
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i asked
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
at that time that
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
we not use
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
politics as a consideration for map
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
drawing and in fact
 
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.430 align:start position:0%
drawing and in fact
i

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
stayed throughout that whole meeting and
 
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
stayed throughout that whole meeting and
and

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.430 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
opinion was unanimous i i have no idea
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
what happened at any of the other
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
sessions that
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
that you attended
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
but i know in stratfor county that was
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
that was the unanimous consent
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
with the recent
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee's proposed map
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's clear that
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
i guess at least the majority decided to
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
ignore those requests
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
and base their decision at least part if
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
not wholly on
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
political considerations giving
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
advantage to the republicans
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
and not only is the action of redrawing
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
voting districts in favor of one party
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
over the other the very definition of
 
00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:41.349 align:start position:0%
over the other the very definition of
gerrymandering

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
but that action also reflects the
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of gerrymandering and that is to
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
either ignore or bypass
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
the voice and opinion of voters
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
this proposal not only reduces the
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
number of spring swing districts
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
but increasingly divides municipalities
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
and school districts into different
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
voting districts making it more
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to pass local legislation
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
aimed at fixing local educational and
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
municipal problems
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
if the current redistricting proposal
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
passes granite staters in the next
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
decade will look upon the past decade as
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
the golden years of government function
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
swing districts
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
are essential to any democracy
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
it forces candidates to develop ideas
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
and strategies that benefit
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
most of the voters in that district
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
not just the voters within their own
 
00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:38.710 align:start position:0%
not just the voters within their own
party

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
by using political party as a criteria
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
for forming voting districts
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
everyone gets hurt
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
republicans democrats
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
and independents
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
republicans and democratic districts
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
will have little or no say in the local
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
issues just as democrats in republican
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
districts will have little or no say but
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
even worse
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
the more vocal extremes of each party
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
will have a bigger say in party politics
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
leaving moderates and independents with
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
no voice
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
and no recourse in either party
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
with gerrymandering elected officials
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
only need to concern themselves with the
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
interests of the larger and more often
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
radical subdivisions with their within
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
their own political parties that makes
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
elections general elections less
 
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.230 align:start position:0%
elections general elections less
valuable

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
and primary elections more valuable
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
which hurts independence
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering has radicalized democracy
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's empowered some groups of people
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
while disenfranchising
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising others
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
we have moved from a government
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
belonging to the voters to a government
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
we've moved away from a system of checks
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
and balances
 
00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
and balances
to

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
a government where political leaders are
 
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.190 align:start position:0%
a government where political leaders are
free

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
from responsibility and accountability
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
from either
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
party the
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan is little more than a
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
power grab at this point and will hurt
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
all granite staters regardless of their
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
party of
 
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.829 align:start position:0%
party of
affiliation

00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
it divides the municipalities and school
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
districts and will further divide
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
neighbor against neighbor
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
the short-term gain
 
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:32.390 align:start position:0%
the short-term gain
that

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.349 align:start position:0%
that
this

00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:34.309 align:start position:0%
this
map

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
proposes for republicans
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
and whatever you may
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
feel you may achieve from that will be
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
more than offset
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
by further frustration
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
and loss of confidence in our state and
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
municipal governments
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
i pray that's not your
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
your goal
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
we live in a in a world now where
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
information is siloed
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
we have uh social media using
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
algorithms to divide people and to
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
emphasize the more radical aspects of
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
either party
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
specific cable news channels
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
catering to liberals and
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
and conservatives
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
and gerrymandering only adds to that
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
it discourages
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
residents from talking to each other
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
and it hurts our ability to talk to our
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
own neighbors to resolve these issues
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
where all of the issues that plague us
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
now whether it's marijuana whether it's
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
abortions you name it
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
this has to be done at a local level not
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
at the national level
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe not even at the state level
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to reconsider your map
 
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.630 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to reconsider your map
drawing

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
drawing
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i thank you not only for your
 
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
and i thank you not only for your
citizenship

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%

00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
committee but also for the time of

i'm i i'm out of practice henry i

this year no problem thank you my name

is henry clemento i would have gotten it
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
right yes absolutely
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm a staff attorney at the aclu of new
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are a non-partisan

nonprofit organization in the new
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire affiliate of the american
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
civil liberties union which is a 2
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
million member strong nationally civil
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
rights group so i've submitted written
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'm not going to repeat it
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
all but i just have three quick points
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to make about the state
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
house maps and then one about the
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
congressional map
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh the first point i'd like to make
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
about the state house map is that it
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
over over-represents the city of
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
claremont and under-represents the city
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
of manchester
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
as you know part two article nine of the
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution requires
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
state house districts shall be as equal
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
as circumstances we'll admit and both
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire and and u.s
 
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.270 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire and and u.s
constitution

00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
have a system in which
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
where the ideal where the maximum
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
deviation and the minimum deviation add
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
up to less than 10 percent it's
 
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.710 align:start position:0%
up to less than 10 percent it's
considered

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
presumptively in compliance with that
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
mandate but uh according to vinovich
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
versus quilter which is at 507 u.s 146
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
any plan with larger disparities in
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
population creates a prima facie case of
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
discrimination and therefore must be
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
justified by the state
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
so the the deviation in the three wards
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
in claremont right now is negative six
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
percent and in manchester it's positive
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh four point nine four percent which is
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
almost 11 and therefore outside the
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
threshold uh and so a court reviewing
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
this plan would not give the state the
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of the doubt that it wasn't
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
discriminating against people and not
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
complying with a one person one vote
 
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.069 align:start position:0%
complying with a one person one vote
threshold

00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
moreover baked into the calculation is
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
the assumption that both cities are
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to perfectly redistrict their
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
wards into equal population when that's
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
probably not the case so in manchester
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
the deviation is 4.94
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
but my rough calculation suggests that
 
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.589 align:start position:0%
but my rough calculation suggests that
if

00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
two or three more people are in one ward
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
of manchester then another that's going
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
to take us above the five percent
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
threshold and the same thing is going to
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
happen in claremont so what looks on
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
paper like an 11 deviation may end up
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
being more like 12 or 13 once the cities
 
00:51:23.839 --> 00:51:24.790 align:start position:0%
being more like 12 or 13 once the cities
uh

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
redraw the wards and that's going to
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
raise constitutional concerns and i
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
imagine would invite litigation down the
 
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.069 align:start position:0%
imagine would invite litigation down the
line

00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
the second point i'd like to make is
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
that the current plan
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
at least opens the door for a racial
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
gerrymander in nashua
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
according to the most recent census
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
figures uh 13.7 percent of people in
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
nashua identify as
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
as hispanic or latinx and the city has
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
been apportioned 27 state
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
representatives and so you would figure
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
with 13.7 percent of the population
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh identifying as hispanic or latinx you
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
might have three or four districts that
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
are majority minority
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
what this committee has done under both
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
the majority and the minority plans
 
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:06.870 align:start position:0%
the majority and the minority plans
is

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh just award three districts three
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
representatives to each ward and leave
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
left it to the city to draw the ward
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
lines and so you could end up in a
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
situation where you have zero minority
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
majority districts
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
and under thornburg versus jingles which
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
is at 478 u.s 30 1986 the supreme court
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
considered the implications of a
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
multi-member district under section two
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the voting rights act which
 
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.589 align:start position:0%
of the voting rights act which
prohibits

00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
voting practices or procedures that
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
discriminate on the basis of race color
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
or membership in a designated language
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
minority group
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think that it's the responsibility of
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
this committee to examine whether single
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
member districts in nashua could be
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
drawn in a way that would comply with
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
the voting rights act and i understand
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
that this the state constitution
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
requires that wards be kept together and
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
not divided up into single member
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
districts but the new hampshire
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
constitution can't override the federal
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
voting rights act which under uh
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh the us constitution article six
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph two provides that the
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
the federal law is the supreme law of
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
the land and so
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
in in thornburg versus jingles the
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court struck down multi-member
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
districts in the north carolina general
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
assembly because they found that they
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
had the effect
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
of unfairly disadvantaged disadvantaging
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh black voters and the same could be
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
true in nashua and i think that this
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
committee should investigate
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
whether the maps that it's drawing
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
comply with the voting rights act
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
the third point i want to make about the
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
state house plan is to inform the
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee of the results of our analysis
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
we hired a company called flow analytics
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
which is a data
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
analysis firm to calculate the mean
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
median partisan lien
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
under the current plans and the proposed
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
majority plans and so the mean median
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
partisan lien is the difference in
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
partisan lien between the state as a
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
whole and the medium district which is
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
to say the district
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's 200 or 201st out of the 400 um
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the left right divide
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
so under the current plan the mean
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
median seat lien currently tilts towards
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
republicans by 0.08 percent and under
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
the proposed plan it tilt towards
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
republicans by 1.3
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
so that's a significant increase in the
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
the partisan of the state as a whole and
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
the median district and is one of the
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
commonly used statistics
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
to evaluate whether a plan constitutes a
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
partisan gerrymander and under our
 
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.230 align:start position:0%
partisan gerrymander and under our
analysis

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
this plan does
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
finally i just want to make a point that
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure others will make two and i've
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
heard made before about house bill 52
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
which is the reapportionment of the
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
congressional districts
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
this plan
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
has the effect of shifting over a
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
quarter of new hampshire's population
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
into a different congressional district
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
and severing the relationship between
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
the voter and their current
 
00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:05.349 align:start position:0%
the voter and their current
representative

00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
and has the effect of shifting the
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
partisan lien of each district by six
 
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:10.630 align:start position:0%
partisan lien of each district by six
points

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
points
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so what it does according to 538
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
which is a political science and
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
statistics website is it would turn new
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire's two competitive
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
congressional districts into one
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
guaranteed democratic district in one
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
guaranteed republican district
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
noted unh political science professor
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
dante scala has explained that he and
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
his research assistant tried to draw a
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
map that would have greater partisan
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
advantage for the republicans and were
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
unable to do so
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i'll just leave that with you all and
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions now or
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%

i have been a supervisor of the

free time registering one republican
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
voter after another including at
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
elections when we have same-day
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
registration when sometimes i am there
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
for 12 hours and do not register a
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
single person in my own town count in my

um but i do it because i believe in the
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
power of the vote the power of the vote
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
for all not just people with whom i
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
share political views
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
when i testified at the belknap county
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
listening session in laconia i expressed
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
my confidence
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
that this committee
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
would do the right thing
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
at this point my confidence has seemed
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit misplaced
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence provided so far
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
but i am not giving up
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the new hampshire house
 
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.190 align:start position:0%
with regard to the new hampshire house
seats

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that the committee
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
majority maps seem to have almost
 
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
totally abandoned the goal of localized
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
representation even in situations where
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
the obvious result would be to have
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
separate districts with towns having
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
their own representatives your maps
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
combined towns multi-town districts
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
become the norm
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
there are other maps available and one
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
of them is being provided
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
to you later in testimony by don house
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
of belmont and i would support that map
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
with regard to belknap county as
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
being much better
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
matched to the goal of localized
 
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.950 align:start position:0%
matched to the goal of localized
representation

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
i would also remind the committee that
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
the one-person one-vote
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
rule is flexible the u.s constitution
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
allows for variation
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to the deviation
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing about
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to do away with
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
localized representation
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
then let's do away with the
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house of representatives
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
having 400 members
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
there is only one reason why we have
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
such a ridiculously
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
large legislature and that is to provide
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you hired somebody to go out and
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
survey people
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
in towns where they
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
are represented by
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
legislators from other towns
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
it would be very interesting to see how
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
have ever met their representative
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
how many of them
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
can name their representative how many
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
of them even recognize the name of their
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative when you provide it
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
we had a concrete example of that in
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
laconia in testimony where a
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative stood up and said he
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
liked representing two towns
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
and then we heard right after him
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
a citizen from the town he did not live
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
in stand up and said i rode in the
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
elevator with this man i've never seen
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
as for the congressional districts
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
the majority map is nothing short of a
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
disgrace and it is a huge disappointment
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
there hasn't even been an attempt to
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
disguise this blatant grab for political
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
power it violates every standard of
 
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.069 align:start position:0%
power it violates every standard of
decency

01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
decency
 
01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:17.190 align:start position:0%
decency
and

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
most importantly it is a slap in the
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
face to all of the new hampshire voters
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
who supported the fair redistricting
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
in their town votes
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
and i remind you all that that was a
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
non-partisan effort that united people
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
from all sides of the political spectrum
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
my very conservative town of alton
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
joined other red towns and purple towns
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
and blue towns to vote yes to fair
 
01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.430 align:start position:0%
and blue towns to vote yes to fair
districting

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
districting
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
if we ask you why you chose to provide a
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered map for the congressional
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
to be your answer
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
i sincerely hope that it is not because
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's not the legacy that you should
 
01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:04.789 align:start position:0%
that's not the legacy that you should
want

01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to tell your
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
children and grandchildren that you
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
stood up for fairness for all
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
not that you acted out of part as part
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
partisan politicians or party
 
01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:20.230 align:start position:0%
partisan politicians or party
opportunists

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
opportunists
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
with your congressional map you have
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
packed one party into a district making
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
it a very safe seat and the other party
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the other district
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
so safe is a democratic district
 
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.789 align:start position:0%
so safe is a democratic district
that

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes of elections will be decided
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
totally at the nomination level
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
stage of the process voters in the other
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
party will have a meaningless vote they
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
will essentially be disenfranchised
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
as you probably know gerrymandering
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
contributes to polarization
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
favoring nomination of candidates on the
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
edges or the fringes of each party
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
the end result
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
cynicism on both sides of the aisle
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
something we already have more of than
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
most of us
 
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
most of us
want

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
although i no longer feel as optimistic
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
as i did when i spoke in laconia it is
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
nevertheless my hope that you will think
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
about the voters of new hampshire all
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
the voters and listen to their voice and
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
do what you know is right as i said in
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
laconia we can't make you do the right
 
01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:31.109 align:start position:0%
laconia we can't make you do the right
thing

01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
only you can do that
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
i also have a letter to submit from
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.510 align:start position:0%

allows town's sufficient population to
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
have their own state representatives not
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
shared with other towns for the town of
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
amherst to partition the new hampshire
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
general court and it for its own

ensuring that the state representatives
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
properly represent the town's interests
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
that said given the maps that we have
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
before us to consider
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
i echo the sentiments of the
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative from milford in stating
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
the preference for pragmatic reasons
 
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.069 align:start position:0%
the preference for pragmatic reasons
of

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
shared interest in community
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
services and resources throughout the
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
town of milford and amherst and i think
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
that that is a natural pairing between
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
the two but that given um i did want to
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that you again had the letter
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the amherst board of selectmen so
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
deborah nelson is signed up to speak
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i assumed you would
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
be limiting the length of my
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
we can do that if you want
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
i mean so i pre-limited them
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
but i want first of all to thank you all
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
very much for the work that you are
 
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.270 align:start position:0%
very much for the work that you are
doing

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
i commend you for having figured out how
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
to use those
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
flash drives that you were given
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
highly recommend
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
that you seek out and study the maps
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
presented by the mapathon and the fair
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
maps group
 
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
maps group
to

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:26.690 align:start position:0%

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:27.990 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
reconsider after this meeting but these
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
are my remarks i want to say good
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
morning my name is deborah nelson and i
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
am from the town of hanover
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
until i recently retired i taught
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
american studies for almost three
 
01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.309 align:start position:0%
american studies for almost three
decades

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
at lebanon high school
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
over the years i taught my students to
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
take the act of voting seriously
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
and encourage them to volunteer on
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
campaigns so they would understand the
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
importance of political engagement
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
they studied the foundations of
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
representational government
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they learn to research positions
 
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.789 align:start position:0%
and they learn to research positions
and

01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
and
then

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
to select candidates based on these
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
positions now mind you none of them
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
could vote but that was not yet the
 
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.510 align:start position:0%
could vote but that was not yet the
point

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
the one subject that inevitably caused
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
them tremendous dismay was
 
01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.910 align:start position:0%
them tremendous dismay was
gerrymandering

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we looked at many egregious examples
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
and discussed the insidious reasons
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
why committees choose to make it very
 
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.109 align:start position:0%
why committees choose to make it very
difficult

01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
for members of one party
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
to be successful
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
when running for office
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm confident
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
that my former students regard the
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
majority's congressional maps
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
with dismay
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
and even anger
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
at the blatant gerrymandering that has
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
taken place
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
dismay that instead of moving one
 
01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:01.029 align:start position:0%
dismay that instead of moving one
community

01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
to balance population numbers between
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
the two districts
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
republicans think it wise to move 75
 
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
republicans think it wise to move 75
towns

01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
and 365
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
000 703 people
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
into a different district
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
by the way as i'm sure you know from
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
1883 to 2022
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
a span of nearly 140 years
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
only 22 towns have moved districts
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
i am also sure that some of my students
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
are angry
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
that republicans
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
and independents
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
in district two but especially
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
republicans have been deemed unimportant
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
to their own party
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
just as democrats in the new district
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
one will be effectively disenfranchised
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
my students were taught
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
that they selected their candidate
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
and not the other way around
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is my sincere hope that you will
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
reconsider your maps
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
and trust in the intelligence of new
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters to like my students
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
research positions
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then select their candidates based
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
on those positions thank you very much
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i also have a second letter
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
that i was given i don't know if there
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
is time for me to read why don't you
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
just pass that in i think at this point
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
if people are not present
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm standing here in front of you
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
against my doctor's wishes because i am
 
01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
against my doctor's wishes because i am
immunocompromised

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
but i feel that i have no choice but to
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
do that in order to know that my voice
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
is being heard here today
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to also thank you for
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
your time
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
your travel
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
and your efforts in undertaking this
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult task
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
i've been very engaged in your process
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
since you began
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i've been at all of your hearings
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
and work sessions
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
i did this because i was concerned
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
and i needed to feel more sure that this
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
was going to be a fair and transparent
 
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.749 align:start position:0%
was going to be a fair and transparent
process

01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
along with 73 other towns represented
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
over 500 000 people our very red town
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
passed a warn article
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
roughly two to one supporting fair
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
and public process
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
and also raised the issue that we wanted
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
our own
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
representation where we constitutionally
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
qualified for that
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
our population is just over nine
 
01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:09.669 align:start position:0%
our population is just over nine
thousand

01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
this is not
partisan

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
and upholding our constitution to the
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
extent possible
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
so all this time i've been pretty
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
anxious to see the proposed maps for
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
on map 15a
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
we achieved the outcome our constitution
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
provides for
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
and we were uncoupled from a town that
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
we had no commonality with
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
and were finally standing alone sharing
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
flow tario's with the neighboring town
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
on map 15 b however we are coupled with
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
yet a different town that we share
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
nothing with
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
no schools no emergency services nothing
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
so we're back to where we were without
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
our own reps attached to a town that we
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
have no interest with
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
then we came to our congressional
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
district maps
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
one carried the tradition of largely
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
leaving the map unchanged except for a
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
minor adjustment to equalize population
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
and one constructed a very convoluted
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
drawing of the map which really seems to
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
make little sense despite the efforts to
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
make a case for the consolidation of the
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
southern tier
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
at the expense of fragmenting the
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
seacoast area among other weaknesses
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
it does however give mr sepanek the gift
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
of guaranteeing his promise
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
of electing a republican
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
to a congressional seat in 2022
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
any semblance of con petition
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
in our congressional districts is gone
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to primaries
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative lynn commented
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
that of course it's political it's an
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
exercise conducted in the legislature
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i do understand the difference
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
between politics
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
and partisanship
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
this map b
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
is clearly both
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
my face in this process was relatively
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted by this egregious
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
display of packing the district
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure an outcome which is exactly
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
what this does
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
my hope is that you take
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
our comments
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
and please
 
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.669 align:start position:0%
and please
re-review

01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
re-review
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
what you've done
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak from tamworth
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak i'm here
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
reading a letter sent
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
by becky o'donnell
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
of londonderry addressed to the new
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire redistricting committee
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
she it says
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
my name is becky o'donnell i am a
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
resident of londonderry i was at the
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
state house last week when your
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee presented your
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
proposals for redistricting maps
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
i am particularly concerned about the
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
republican proposal for congressional
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
district maps which clearly shows
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
favoritism to the republican party just
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
as the chair of the new hampshire
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
republican party promised earlier this
 
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.390 align:start position:0%
republican party promised earlier this
year

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of redistricting is to
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
protect the right of all citizens to
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
have their vote counted equally
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
not to guarantee that one party has a
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
strong advantage
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
what you are doing is gerrymandering
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
as your congressional map clearly shows
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
what we new hampshire voters want is
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
fairness and redistricting not
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered maps i ask that you
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
rethink your maps thank you
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak from lebanon is
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
my name is paulina seaus i live and work
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
in lebanon new hampshire which is in
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
grafton county
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to express my concern about
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
the currently proposed maps for house
 
01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:03.990 align:start position:0%
the currently proposed maps for house
seats

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
seats
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
even though hanover is eligible for its
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
own district based on the population
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
size the current proposals from either a
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
majority or minority did not grant that
 
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
majority or minority did not grant that
representation

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
as of the 2020 census the population of
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
hanover was 11
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
hundred seventy people
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
every three thousand four hundred forty
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
four people are supposed to get their
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
own state representative
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
this technically diminishes the voice of
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
hanover voters and is not fair
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
thus i strongly suggest adopting the map
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
from mapathon which takes hanover's
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
population size into account and grants
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
the city its own district
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
my second concern is about the
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
congressional proposal from the
 
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
congressional proposal from the
republicans

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
this is the biggest shift of new
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire towns in 140 years without a
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
good reason except for pure
 
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.030 align:start position:0%
good reason except for pure
gerrymandering

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
it packs republicans into congressional
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
district 1 and democrats into
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
congressional district 2
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
thus making it very unlikely for
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
democrats to win in cd1 and impossible
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
for republicans to win in city 2.
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
this will eliminate the competitive
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
nature of new hampshire elections
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
if members of the same party win year of
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
this will disenfranchise the voters and
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
they will be less motivated to
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
participate in future elections
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
it really is disconcerting that the
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
republican party takes away the power of
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
members of its own party
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the congressional district too
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
thus i speak against the republican
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
proposal and called to adopt either a
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
democratic or a mapathon proposal for
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
congressional redistricting
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
my third concern is about this process
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
poor communication with the people who
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
elected you
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
the public was given short notice
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
there is no interactive option to attend
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
this public hearing online
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
and the special committee did not fully
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
disclose what criteria they used in
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
creation of their maps
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
or how the reconciliation process will
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
be handled
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
this is not open or transparent
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention i submitted
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony in writing as well
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
good morning judith mackerson franklin
 
01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
good morning judith mackerson franklin
i'm

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
pleased to be here from a community that
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
did sign on to a resolution
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
fair and open uh process in
 
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.669 align:start position:0%
fair and open uh process in
redistricting

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't prepare any written statements
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
so just
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
bear with me
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of points that i wanted to make
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
during during the thick of covid last
 
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.830 align:start position:0%
during during the thick of covid last
year

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
it was such a gift to the citizens of
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to be able to participate
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
in hearings in in the governmental
 
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
in hearings in in the governmental
process

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
through a very well-run zoom
 
01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.110 align:start position:0%
through a very well-run zoom
platform

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
certainly it was proven that it could be
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
done and it was done very well
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh it was certainly
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
helpful for me not wanting to
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
travel down to concord uh when you
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
really didn't know who you'd be sitting
 
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.830 align:start position:0%
really didn't know who you'd be sitting
with

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
that was a that was a gift that you gave
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
to the people of new hampshire
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i felt
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
some some hope that this would transfer
 
01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
some some hope that this would transfer
into

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
other other hearings of this sort i'm
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
very disappointed that it has not been
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
available to the citizens of new
 
01:18:58.159 --> 01:18:59.590 align:start position:0%
available to the citizens of new
hampshire

01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
i also um
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about the people who run
 
01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about the people who run
for

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
political office
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
obviously we're all coming from our own
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
different political parties we have
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
republicans running we have democrats
 
01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
republicans running we have democrats
running

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
running
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
once that person is elected however
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
i feel that they have an obligation to
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
represent their community
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
if you've been
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
voted to represent say the community of
 
01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.550 align:start position:0%
voted to represent say the community of
franklin

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
franklin
um

01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
you may not have been elected by every
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
person in that community
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
but i feel that your interest should be
 
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
but i feel that your interest should be
in

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
recognizing the needs of your whole
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
community and listening to people from
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.669 align:start position:0%
both sides
and

01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think the this process shows that
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes you're very shut down
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's you know who do i have to
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
please not what is the right thing to do
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
so i hope that you will really take
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
take to heart
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
that when you are elected
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
you are elected four-year-old whole
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
community for your whole constituency
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
not just the people that voted for you
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and speaking
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
alvin c has signed up to speak from
 
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:24.790 align:start position:0%
alvin c has signed up to speak from
loudoun

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and member of
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is alvin c i live
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
in loudoun
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
address the
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
congressional districts i think that the
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
map shown on map 18b
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
is grossly
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh gerrymandered and should be rejected
 
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
uh gerrymandered and should be rejected
outright

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
outright
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
the map shown on 18a
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
is laudable simply because it only
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
required one town to be shifted there
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
may have been a different town or a pair
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
of towns that could have been shifted to
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same thing but the
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
intent was there
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
but however
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
i prefer the map submitted by the
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
mapathon project
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
district with um
 
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
district with um
less

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
bumps and
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
this uh
um

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know basically a a
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
much more concise shape
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
than what we have now
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
then as far as and i won't go into any
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
more elaboration on that
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
just to save time
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
for the house districts i would
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
encourage you to adopt maps that
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
provide for the smallest size districts
 
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.950 align:start position:0%
provide for the smallest size districts
possible

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
and reduce the number of towns and
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
cities that are
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
merged together just so that the
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
distribution of representatives is more
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to present
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning i am kate
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
from peterborough i'm a member of the
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%

league of women voters and open
democracy

01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
and i have followed very closely from
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
the beginning the redistricting process
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the fair maps coalitions are
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
embarked upon
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's a theme this morning so i too am
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
from one of the 74 towns that
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
resoundingly passed on a bipartisan
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
basis in my town as well
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
a citizen petition warrant article
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
calling for fair transparent and
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan redistricting process
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
we are at an inflection point right now
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
to assure that the maps that come out of
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
this process are not partisan
 
01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:16.149 align:start position:0%
this process are not partisan
redistricting

01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
they determine a representative
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
democracy of our state for the next 10
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
years that's a weighty responsibility
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
but it can be done well
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your hard work to make
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
sure that this does happen
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
i am reading two short statements for
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
citizens who are not able to be here in
 
01:23:35.199 --> 01:23:36.550 align:start position:0%
citizens who are not able to be here in
person

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the first one addressed to your
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee is from ann garland of lebanon
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
to members of the house special
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting in looking at
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the recently proposed new hampshire
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
congressional map
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
i am trying to understand the criteria
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
the committee used in drawing the two
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire congressional districts
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
in fact the criteria was never revealed
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
despite scores of voter requests to do
 
01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
despite scores of voter requests to do
so

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
so why after 140 years of a consistent
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
congressional district map
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
drawn by republicans does the new
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
proposal no longer resemble its
 
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.350 align:start position:0%
proposal no longer resemble its
predecessors

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
predecessors
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
if you considered compactness as a
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
criteria this certainly has not been
 
01:24:21.679 --> 01:24:22.709 align:start position:0%
criteria this certainly has not been
achieved

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
achieved
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
cd1 looks like an angry voter shouting
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
out at cd2
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
its chin is jutting out westward its
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
hooked nose overhangs an open mouth
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the back of its head drops down to
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
shoulders outlined by a ridge of town
 
01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.550 align:start position:0%
shoulders outlined by a ridge of town
towns

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
oddly allocated to the other district
 
01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
oddly allocated to the other district
cd2

01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
cd2
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
what possible criteria could have
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
created such a figure
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
moreover the proposed congressional map
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
has shifted the partisan balance of the
 
01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.669 align:start position:0%
has shifted the partisan balance of the
districts

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
what justification do you have for
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
packing democrats into district 2
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
and moving more republicans into
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
district 1
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
and making both districts less
 
01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
and making both districts less
competitive

01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
if one of the redistricting principles
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
was political fairness this clearly has
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
not been met
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
what has been accomplished is that
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
republican democratic and unaffiliated
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
voters now have had the power of their
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
votes diminished which is a sad
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
accomplishment indeed
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
there is no other conclusion but the
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
dishonesty and gerrymandering have been
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
at work
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
you have the power to change this it is
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
not too late for a do-over and rather
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
than letting the candidates pick the
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
voters please work within the committee
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
to come up with a congressional map that
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
lets the voters pick the candidates
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
make the congressional maps more
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
competitive it would be the right and
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
the smart thing to do
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
just as your fellow republicans have
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
done for a hundred years before
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
in garland of lebanon
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
and this one is even shorter
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
dear committee this is from stephen
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
bourne of rye is this letter shorter i
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
just feel bad because i i had somebody
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
not read a letter so i know but i didn't
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
use my three minutes well that's what
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm keeping in mind so that's i want to
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
let everybody know what we are both
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
again thank you
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
dear committee at your rockingham county
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
listening session i reminded you that
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
your predecessors were adamant the
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
people assured no group of men
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
pervert the ends of government for their
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
own emolument article 10 of the new
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire bill of rights
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
what means of redress do you lisa leave
 
01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
what means of redress do you lisa leave
us

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
if you put one group above another by
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
continuing to gerrymander new hampshire
 
01:26:36.639 --> 01:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
continuing to gerrymander new hampshire
districts

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
over 37 percent of new hampshire voters
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
are registered undeclared but you are
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
stacking the deck against us by packing
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
party-leaning communities into opposite
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
districts what respect can our youth and
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
younger generations have for our
 
01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.709 align:start position:0%
younger generations have for our
democracy

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
if you continue to rig the system and
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
put party above people i implore you to
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
have the fortitude to free new hampshire
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the slightest scent of gerrymandering
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
the mapathon project proves that there
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
are better solutions our democracy only
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
functions as designed when our leaders
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
climb above partisanship
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
if you are struggling to stand up to
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
party pressure feel free to blame me and
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
all the others who want to keep our
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
democracy from being perverted by
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
political parties the 74 communities who
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
voted to tell you they want fair and
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
open redistricting are a statistically
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
significant sample
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
clearly communicating new hampshire does
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
not want to be gerrymandered
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully yours stephen born rye

thank you very much madam chair members
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
is dan mcguire and i'm from epsom
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's such a pleasure to be back in this
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
fantastic room after so many months away
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
is less than one-half of one percent of
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore we're like the flea on the
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
dog's back you know we're along for the
 
01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.470 align:start position:0%
dog's back you know we're along for the
ride

01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
ride
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
but it behooves us to try to
 
01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.669 align:start position:0%
but it behooves us to try to
influence

01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
influence
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
the united states as much as we can
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
and we clearly believe in that
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the presidential case because we have
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
the first in the nation primary and the
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of which
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
is to exert our influence on the choice
 
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:42.850 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:43.990 align:start position:0%
of the two
[Music]

01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
to to have outsized
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
influence there
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
we also have an outsized influence in
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
the u.s
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
senate simply by the structure of it
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have 2 percent of the u.s senate
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
comes from new hampshire despite our
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
much tinier size
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the u.s
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
congress u.s house
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
how can we have
 
01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
how can we have
an

01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
an extra influence
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
right how can we how can we um
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
create a situation
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
where our representatives
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
are as effective as possible
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
the us house runs on two principles just
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
like most other legislative bodies
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
people in the majority have obviously a
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
considerable more influence than people
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the minority
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
but even so even more so in the us house
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
than than our house
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
seniority counts
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
right it's the senior members the
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee chairs and other leadership
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the u.s house
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
that control that organization
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the majority right this the senior
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
members of the majority the committee
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
chairs and so on
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
take for example the speaker of the
 
01:30:12.719 --> 01:30:13.750 align:start position:0%
take for example the speaker of the
house

01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.709 align:start position:0%
house
right

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:15.669 align:start position:0%
right
someone

01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative pelosi
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
who comes from a very safe district
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
right someone who's been in the house
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
and has slowly increased her
 
01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.510 align:start position:0%
and has slowly increased her
seniority

01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
seniority
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
and more
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so on
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
our current system of electing
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
u.s representatives almost guarantees us
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we will not have much influence in
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
the u.s house
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
because the seats are unsafe
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
right someone in a safe seat and our
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
system by the way is is very beneficial
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
to incumbents right we have an extremely
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
late primary
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
which which helps incumbents
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
but someone in a safe seat
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to spend a lot of time
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
and effort running for reelection
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
the re-election is more assured so they
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
can build their seniority
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
the majority's plan
 
01:31:26.639 --> 01:31:27.990 align:start position:0%
the majority's plan
which

01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
improves the safety of the seeds
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
number one make sure that we will always
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
have a new hampshire representative in
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
and number two means that that because
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
the seed is safe the person
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
the representatives
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
can build their influence
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
in the u.s house
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
and rise through the ranks become
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee chairs become in leadership
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
and have more influence
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
the current system
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
where representatives need to spend huge
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
amounts of time
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
running for reelection being careful
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
not creating waves
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
almost guarantees that they cannot
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
become in leadership and therefore have
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
very little influence
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the us congress
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and members of the committee
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to appear
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your hard work
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is gail kinney
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
i am a resident of canaan
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm also a pastor with the united church
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
of christ
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
and as i've conveyed to you previously
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
as i view this whole redistricting
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
process and have been watching on what
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
i view this both through a moral lens
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
and through the lens of a resident of a
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
community which
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
has been robbed of its constitutional
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
right to a single town representative
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
and according to the proposal
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
the majority proposal
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
i am a resident of a town that will
 
01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.270 align:start position:0%
i am a resident of a town that will
continue

01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be robbed
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
of that right to a single town
 
01:33:36.719 --> 01:33:38.149 align:start position:0%
of that right to a single town
representative

01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
so i still have a question for you that
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
i've had from the beginning
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
and that is how did you approach the
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
matter of part two article 11 of the new
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution that says that
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire towns with a sufficient
 
01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire towns with a sufficient
population

01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.110 align:start position:0%
population
shall

01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
shall
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
shall have their own representative
 
01:33:57.199 --> 01:33:58.229 align:start position:0%
shall have their own representative
district

01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
i would have hoped that from day one as
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
this committee gathered that you would
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
have started by asking yourselves
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
what are the communities in the state of
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that are now
 
01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that are now
on

01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
put in representative districts that are
 
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.550 align:start position:0%
put in representative districts that are
unconstitutional

01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
and then how can we cure that in the
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
so if you didn't make that um rising to
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
to cure the unconstitutional nature of
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
so many i think of 62 districts in new
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and make the change
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
why wasn't that a priority and i hope
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
that you will explain that to everyone
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
so you've heard from the canaan select
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
board you've heard from canaan residents
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
about the unconstitutionality of our
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
current district
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
but it's clear that even though
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
i would say there's been a slight
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
improvement in terms of the the coupling
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
of of towns in your proposals
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
kanan still is robbed of that single
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
town representative and so i just wonder
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
what did shall mean to you as you went
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
and why didn't xiaomi shall for the town
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
of canaan and so just a really quick
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
comment about congressional districts
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
just say my husband
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
votes in every election um federal state
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
and local
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
without fail but he is also completely
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
apolitical and nonpartisan
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
um but he took a look at the map
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
the new congressional district one and
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
he laughed he thought it was a joke he
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
thought you can't be serious this is an
 
01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
thought you can't be serious this is an
embarrassment

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
embarrassment
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
and before this process even started we
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
heard from a leader of one of the
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
political parties in the state saying
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to use this process to
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
create an absolutely guaranteed
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
district for our party
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then what has happened i hope that
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
you would do differently
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
but it looks like you have become or the
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
majority has become handmaidens for that
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
promise from a party leader
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
and i would say that that is simply an
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
embarrassment it's an embarrassment for
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
you it's an embarrassment for our state
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
we've never had this kind of
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering in congressional
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
districts before and now is not a time
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
to start so again from that moral lens i
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
pray that you will go back to the
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
drawing board and you will do something
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
that passes the smell test and if not
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
we who are here we who are concerned
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
about that would have just no recourse
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
but to ask you
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
next signed up to speak
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
is bernie cameron from deerfield
 
01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.870 align:start position:0%
is bernie cameron from deerfield
thanks

01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
bernie cameron from deerfield new
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and thank you
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
for having these hearings after the
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary maps have been drawn
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
yeah come down i know that at the
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
hearings that we had earlier that this
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
was certainly requested and thank you
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
for honoring that
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
i want to just make three quick points
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted to address um district one of
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted to point out that the minority
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
standard deviation is considerably less
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
than the majority one
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
but more than that
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
i want you to know i've lived in
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
deerfield 50 years now
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
if you stop anyone on the street in
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
deerfield and show them these two maps
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
and they look at the one of us with
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
auburn and candia
 
01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
auburn and candia
they

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
they would be astounded
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
the remark that they would say that i've
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
heard over and over
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
from people from all
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
parties republican democrat independent
 
01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.629 align:start position:0%
parties republican democrat independent
is

01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything in common with
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
candy and auburn
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the truth candier and auburn
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
are very manchester-centric towns they
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
have 101
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
fast highway that brings them
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
there quickly they have most of their
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
business most of their is manchester
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
in deerfield
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
similar to northwood in nottingham we go
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
all over
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
many of us work i have services in
 
01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.149 align:start position:0%
many of us work i have services in
concord

01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
some are in exeter some in dover some in
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
manchester but it's pretty spread
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
between the four
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a previous speaker mentioned we were
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
originally part of the town of
 
01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.350 align:start position:0%
originally part of the town of
nottingham

01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
nottingham
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
our cultures are very similar
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
i would really um intercede for you to
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
please honor the minority plan for
 
01:38:48.159 --> 01:38:49.830 align:start position:0%
please honor the minority plan for
deerfield

01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
deerfield
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
second of all i am in awe of the work
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you do
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
paying much more attention to
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
redistricting this time
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i've come to learn the constraints
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
that you're working under between the
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
federal constitution
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
our state constitution
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
one vote one person
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
the deviations etc it's obvious from all
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
that testified during the hearings
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
that they want their own district it's
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
very important to them
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you to look at our
 
01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:25.940 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:27.189 align:start position:0%
state constitution
[Music]

01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
decide are there areas where there could
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
be modifications where there could be
 
01:39:33.119 --> 01:39:34.310 align:start position:0%
be modifications where there could be
amendments

01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
to try to honor
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
this yearning
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
that people are expressing every speaker
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
is talking about that they have it all
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
the hearings this is something that we
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
need to do in deerfield this is
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
the third thing which i wasn't going to
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
speak about but after hearing comments
 
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.270 align:start position:0%
speak about but after hearing comments
about

01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
we need saved districts
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
that gave me a visceral response
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
it is so against a democracy
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and against our history of voting in
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
this country
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
to hear someone actually advocate
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
for safe districts
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
i grew up
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
with a very um with immigrant parents so
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a first generation
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
they were so excited to come to this
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
country and to be able to vote
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
and they spent and taught me to spend so
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
much time at looking at individual
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
candidates no matter the party i have
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
voted in both parties
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
but to look for the best candidate
 
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.470 align:start position:0%
but to look for the best candidate
never

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
never would i ever consider
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
to try to keep a safe
 
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.149 align:start position:0%
to try to keep a safe
candidate

01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you miss cameron
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is barbara

and i've lived in concord for 23 years
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
i read on behalf of david murray of

i read on behalf of david murray of
tuftenburg

01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
tuftenburg
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
whose opinion i strongly support
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
david's words follow
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
members of the special new hampshire
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
house redistricting committee
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
i'm writing this to ask you to stop the
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering and make the
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting of new hampshire fair for
 
01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
redistricting of new hampshire fair for
elections

01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's time both sides democrats and
 
01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.350 align:start position:0%
it's time both sides democrats and
republicans

01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
make the changes to truly allow for we
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
this new gerrymandering policy
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
is damaging to fair elections for years
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
to come
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
please allow
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
a non-partisan group to redistrict the
 
01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
a non-partisan group to redistrict the
state

01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
so that all votes count properly
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
and do not give favor to one side or the
 
01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.189 align:start position:0%
and do not give favor to one side or the
other

01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you on behalf of david and myself
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
for your consideration
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
david andrews from chichester has signed
 
01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
david andrews from chichester has signed
up

01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
david andrews chichester
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
i think i more than anyone else could
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
understand the enormity of the task
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
before you and how hard you guys have
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
been working on the
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
house maps for
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in particular
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
i could probably spend a couple hours
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the nuances of each of the
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
counties i'm not going to don't worry
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to bring up a couple of
 
01:43:14.639 --> 01:43:16.149 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to bring up a couple of
points

01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
one that's been brought up
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
with the majorities map in hillsborough
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
manchester is allowed
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the deviation of plus or
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
minus 5
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
you could give them between 32 and 35
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
seats with 34 being the closest to the
 
01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.189 align:start position:0%
seats with 34 being the closest to the
ideal

01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
with the majority map giving only 32
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
seats to manchester
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
it would only take a difference of 18
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
people in the wards in order to make
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
that map go over the 5
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
and thus
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
make it invalid
 
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.870 align:start position:0%
make it invalid
overall

01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that you look at
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
either the minorities map which gives 33
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
or the map-a-thons map which gives 34 to
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
manchester and i think helps
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
another of the issues is in sullivan
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
both the majority and the minorities
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
between uh i believe it's lebanon and
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
i forget exactly where but they both use
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the majorities map
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
uses that point
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the benefit of the map overall so i
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a reasonable uh use of
 
01:44:39.679 --> 01:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a reasonable uh use of
that

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
technically contiguous point
 
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.030 align:start position:0%
technically contiguous point
um

01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
oh it's between cornish craw
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
and newport
 
01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:50.790 align:start position:0%
and newport
so

01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the majorities they use that to kind
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
of enhance the map
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
the problem with the minorities map is
 
01:44:56.639 --> 01:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
the problem with the minorities map is
that

01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
they use one district across it one way
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then they use a floaterial across it
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
the other way and i'm not sure if that's
 
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
the other way and i'm not sure if that's
technically

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
technically
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
allowed because both districts would
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
then not be contiguous because they kind
 
01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
of cross over each other at that point
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore i would think that that's
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
not technically allowed
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the other problem with the sullivan map
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that with the majority map
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
it goes below the kind of minus five
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
percent deviation to negative six
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think overall that that's an
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
issue in that
 
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
issue in that
the

01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
the whole point is to make sure that
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
people are not under
 
01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.709 align:start position:0%
people are not under
represented

01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so in the case of manchester that
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be the case where it would go over
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of the five percent people would be
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
underrepresented but in sullivan county
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
they would be kind of overrepresented
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
and because of the way that we apportion
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
representatives by county
 
01:45:56.159 --> 01:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
representatives by county
um

01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
for instance belknap county gets
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
18.502 or 18.498 so they get 18. so
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're kind of on the the
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh being kind of underrepresented
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
overall but sullivan counties on the
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
other end and thus kind of is
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
overrepresented so if we are going to
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
apportion representatives by county i
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
don't think it's uh overall issue if
 
01:46:20.719 --> 01:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
don't think it's uh overall issue if
some

01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
are more
 
01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
are more
uh

01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
represented than others if we're going
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
to do it that way anyway
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense to me to
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
to worry of too much about the the
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
negative deviation rather than the the
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
positive deviation of someone being
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
underrepresented and
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
actually we were able to draw three maps
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
for three counties that use that kind of
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
extra negative deviation in order to
 
01:46:48.639 --> 01:46:49.590 align:start position:0%
extra negative deviation in order to
draw

01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
draw
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
what i believe are better maps
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
one for sullivan county which
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't use that
 
01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:57.669 align:start position:0%
doesn't use that
point

01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:46:57.679 --> 01:46:58.790 align:start position:0%
point
in

01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
between those towns but allows for all
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
three of the eligible towns in that
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
county to have their own representatives
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
um one for
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
carroll county which allows for
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
all but wolfeboro all those towns in
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro to to get their own
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
districts and then one in
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
stratford county which does a a good job
 
01:47:23.199 --> 01:47:24.070 align:start position:0%
stratford county which does a a good job
of

01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
limiting the um number of
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
towns that don't get their own
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
representatives and
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
um it gives
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
summer's worth kind of two
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
representatives uh and we'll be
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
submitting those those maps to you um
 
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.030 align:start position:0%
submitting those those maps to you um
and

01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh i also went through all of the
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
different kind all the different
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
submissions between the minority the
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
majority and the mapathon groups and
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
kind of um
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
went through and
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
chose kind of the best of of each of the
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
maps and there's some of each
 
01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.790 align:start position:0%
maps and there's some of each
and

01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
actually went through and drew
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
kind of two new maps one for hillsboro
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
that uses kind of a combination and one
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
for rockingham that uses a combination
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
of kind of all three
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
it uses parts of the republican
 
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.070 align:start position:0%
it uses parts of the republican
plan

01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
it uses the
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
the part of the democrat plan that was
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
talked about with deerfield so it puts
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
deerfield with nottingham and northwood
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
and then it uses part of the maplecon
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
plan to come up with a plan that that
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
i believe is a lot better than all three
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
so combined we we we made a pretty
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of just what i wanted to
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
talk about for the for the house maps
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
for the congressional maps
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
what the kind of goal
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the majority proposal was it was to
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know create one safe seat
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
for democrats and one safe seat for
 
01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.030 align:start position:0%
for democrats and one safe seat for
republicans

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is that i think that it may
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
be a little bit short-sighted of a of a
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
thought in that
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
especially with today's announcement
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
that governor sununu is going to be
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
running for governor and not the senate
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
there could be
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
kind of no competitive statewide races
 
01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.709 align:start position:0%
kind of no competitive statewide races
in

01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and thus
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
republican voters in cd2 because
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
if chris pappas runs in cd1 it's
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a competitive race
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
no matter what even with this kind of
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
shift i would think that he he would
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
have finished he would have lost by
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
probably two percent in
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
2020 and i think he would have won by a
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
little bit in 2018 so it would still be
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
a very competitive race in cd2 that's
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
not the case there would be
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
oh annie custer would win by a very
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
large margin and if there's no other
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
statewide races
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
that are competitive
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
what do republican voters
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
in cd
 
01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.350 align:start position:0%
in cd
2

01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
2
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
have to vote for
 
01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:04.390 align:start position:0%
have to vote for
they

01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
you could see a vastly
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
lower voter turnout in terms of
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
republican voters all across cd2 and
 
01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:13.830 align:start position:0%
republican voters all across cd2 and
thus

01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
thus
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
could lose the new hampshire house of
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
representatives for the republicans
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
could cause
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
issues with the new hampshire senate and
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
for the executive council i'm not sure
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the tradeoff
 
01:50:27.119 --> 01:50:28.070 align:start position:0%
that the tradeoff
of

01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
one republican
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
congressman for the u.s is worth the new
 
01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
congressman for the u.s is worth the new
hampshire

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
house of representatives or the new
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate or the new hampshire
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
executive council it it it seems that
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's almost like
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
giving up on the possibility with with
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
the shifts that we're seeing in the
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
political landscape it's very
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
conceivable that in you know two four
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
eight years we would be sending two
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
republicans to washington rather than
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
just one and under the
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
majorities plan for the congressional
 
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.189 align:start position:0%
majorities plan for the congressional
seats

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
seats
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's conceivable that we could send two
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
democrats but
 
01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:07.270 align:start position:0%
democrats but
it

01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
would be very very very unlikely to ever
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
send two republicans with those set up
 
01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.589 align:start position:0%
send two republicans with those set up
maps

01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
so i'd ask that you
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
look at the minorities proposal which
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
barely changes it
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
but more importantly look at the
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
mapathon map which
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
puts communities of interest together
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
cuts down on high school saus that are
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
split public health regions that are
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
split counties that are split
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
we shifted the map a little bit
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
in order to bring those communities
 
01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.350 align:start position:0%
in order to bring those communities
together

01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
so people here and people watching are
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
aware the the last speaker david andrews
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
was a mapper with the mapathon project
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
and he has spoken before but that's uh
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
why you were able to hear some very
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
specific references to maps because
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
he has spent a lot of time on this
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning madam chair and
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i am linda
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
bundy from antrim
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
when considering the maps i focused on
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
ones submitted by committee members and
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
the mapathon project
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
i did know additional maps submitted by
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
others and believe this interest and
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
participation is positive and benefits
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
us all
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to the maps for the new
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives i was
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
pleased to see that antrim is not in a
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
floatarial district in any of the maps
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the base districts
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
are compact and keep the towns in our
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
school district together
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
one drawback to the map submitted by the
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee is the very
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
large floatarial district in the
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
southwest part of the county
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
i also understand that giving manchester
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
32 representatives may lead to
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
violations that could be disputed in
 
01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
violations that could be disputed in
court

01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think either the maps submitted by the
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
minority or
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
the mapathon project map best serve more
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
towns than the ones submitted by the
 
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:31.750 align:start position:0%
towns than the ones submitted by the
majority

01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
in regards to the united states
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
congressional maps i realized that
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
changes in population
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
made district changes necessary
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
the map submitted by the minority
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
achieves change in an elegant fashion by
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
moving just one town hampstead
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
this map has low deviation and maintains
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
relatively competitive districts
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
the mapathon project map moves 22 towns
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
but maintains
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
more communities of interest such as
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
shared water services and shared
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
emergency services
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
this map has low deviation and a good
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
balance between rural and urban areas
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
in contrast the map proposed by the
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
majority moves 75 towns and one-fourth
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
of the entire population of the state
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
there is no valid reason for such
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
drastic change
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
although this map has a very low
 
01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.790 align:start position:0%
although this map has a very low
deviation

01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
there is little else to recommend it
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
the partisan balance in the districts
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
has been shifted so that district 1
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
leans strongly republican
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
and district 2 means democratic
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
republican voters in district 2
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
and democratic voters in district 1
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
will have their voices diminished
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
this is not what it means to draw fair
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
maps i ask that the committee approved
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
the map submitted by the minority
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
or the mapathon project or some similar
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
map but not the one submitted by the
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
majority i thank you for your time and
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
your work and the opportunity to speak
 
01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
your work and the opportunity to speak
today

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
are you allowing people to read
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
statements from others
 
01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.709 align:start position:0%
statements from others
i

01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately made one exception to my
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
rule because the speaker really had not
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
taken any time so if you could submit
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
the letter
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
we will take it staff is going to copy
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
scan and committee members will get an
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
email with all of the submitted
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
testimony for today
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
question of the chair please plant him
 
01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:47.109 align:start position:0%
question of the chair please plant him

01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative weber over on my right
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair i just
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
wondered as a follow-up
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
to the gentleman who testified just
 
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.750 align:start position:0%
to the gentleman who testified just
previously

01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
is there a place that members of the
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
public can see the mapathon maps or
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
other maps that are presented by members
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the public because we were
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
promised that that would happen and i
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
have yet to see them go up on our
 
01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.550 align:start position:0%
have yet to see them go up on our
website

01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually i know that there are some
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
mapathon maps that were submitted
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
previously i don't know the current

thank you so that means if you go to the
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
the special committee on redistricting
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
page you can get to it from the home
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
page for the house you click on the
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
special committee
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
view submitted testimony that will be in
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
the center
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the page about a quarter of the way
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
down and then you can look to the
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
corresponding bill for the submissions
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
because while we may be talking about
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
the cd
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
and the house and other races there's
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
actually a specific bill number
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
associated with each of those sets of
 
01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.550 align:start position:0%
associated with each of those sets of
maps

01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
all right see this is what happens when
 
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
you start to let people speak up all
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
right representative mcguire
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to confirm the mapathon maps are
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
readily available from the
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
committee's website and they are
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
readable and you can see them
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the explanation i
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it because i was unable to
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
find them
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber also
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak is representative
 
01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.750 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak is representative
horgan

01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chairman can
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
you hear me with the mask on or should i
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
take it off no we can hear you thank you
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm representing timothy
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
horrigan i'm currently from stratfor
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
district 6.
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
if the majority plan passes i forget
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
what the number of my district is but it
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
will be somewhat different but currently
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
i represent the towns of durham and
 
01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.669 align:start position:0%
i represent the towns of durham and
madbury

01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
madbury
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
so first quickly to address the
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
congressional map
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
as i agree with others it's blatantly
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered although i think um
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think that might backfire because it
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
district that could be flipped from
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
could easily
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
be won by a democrat including the uh
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
incumbent if he chooses to run again i
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
know you're not protecting the
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
incumbents but if he runs again he's uh
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
he'll probably be a very strong
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
candidate in whichever however the
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
district is drawn and if
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
and there are other democrats who live
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
in the district even though it's
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
technically not required but
 
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.270 align:start position:0%
technically not required but
um

01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
who could also put up a strong challenge
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
so that could backfire um this house
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
plan the majority plans are
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered not quite as blatantly
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered as the ones that were
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
presented to us 10 years ago and i
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
applaud you
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
i applaud you and anna
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the member from
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the member from charlestown
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative smith from charlestown so
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
project the process has
 
01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:47.990 align:start position:0%
project the process has
been

01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
not totally transparent but has been
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
much more transparent than it was last
 
01:59:51.679 --> 01:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
much more transparent than it was last
time

01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:54.709 align:start position:0%
time
and

01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
the plan last year also backfired on the
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
republicans because roughly half of the
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
republicans who voted for the plan in
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
2012 were then
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
not there in 2013 most in most cases
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
because they had been defeated in the
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
reelection thing so any
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
these plans are always unpredictable
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
especially with the uh with the house
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
plans doesn't matter how much you want
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
to slander the one side or the other it
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
may not end up being slanted to that
 
02:00:20.239 --> 02:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
may not end up being slanted to that
side

02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
um as for uh
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
as for this plan our the state
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
constitution um
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
clearly states that towns
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i've heard this about a
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
hundred times that towns are
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
entitled to their own a base district
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
with their um
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
with their own reps if it's within if
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's reasonably practicable and that's
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
the districts have to be contiguous and
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
there are several districts like
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
like there's some that are joined only
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
at one point deep in the woods that's
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
obviously not contiguous at all there's
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
others whose continuity is questionable
 
02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.149 align:start position:0%
others whose continuity is questionable
including

02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
on the coast coast map not that there's
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily a different way to draw it
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
district one the northernmost district
 
02:01:11.599 --> 02:01:12.709 align:start position:0%
district one the northernmost district
uh

02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
it has
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
a few populated towns in the northern
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
part of the county and then a few others
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
north of berlin and then the rest of it
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's much of totally unpopulated
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
townships with no high
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
few of any roads connecting them um
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think certainly the
 
02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:32.390 align:start position:0%
i think certainly the
historically

02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
historically
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
um how we got have 400 members by the
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
way which uh and i certainly think after
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
our experience
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic i might
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think that will create a lot of
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
difficulties for us having so many
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
so many members a smaller body probably
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
could have dealt
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
more easily with the crisis but we
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
survived and here we are
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
the reason that was because originally
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
each town
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
sent its own
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
rep or reps if his population was over a
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
now it's also part of where the 100 year
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
salary came from because that was a
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
figure that every town could afford
 
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.629 align:start position:0%
figure that every town could afford
the

02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then eventually and then they had
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
like some provisions for towns with
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
small populations would just send one
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
for part of the tent for just one or two
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
terms out of the uh they would share
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
they would share a district and each
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
town would send one for two years or
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
four years or six
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
during the ten year period between the
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
reapportionment so that
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
they got up to i think about 430
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
folding seats here in rep's hall and
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
that just got to be totally impractical
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that was where they came up with the
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment which says uh
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
400 or actually it's 375 to 400 but it's
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
always we've always gone the maximum
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
number of seats so that's
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
that's where that came from and
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
and eventually and so that was and that
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
principle was then carried over in 2006
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the constitutional amendment which
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
was trying to guarantee towns that are
 
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
was trying to guarantee towns that are
um

02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
at the so-called iodine number which
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
this year i guess at 3044
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
to have their own seed to the base
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
and i think um
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
i think this it's i think this um
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
could be honored more if we uh
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i hate to i hate to break
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
try to dispute a bipartisan
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh consensus when there is
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
so few things that the two parties agree
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
on but i think the plus or minus five
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
percent the rationale for it is in my
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
mind totally unclear and i've tried to
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
see what it is
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
we and
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
other states with large legislatures and
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
small populations including our
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the east and west vermont
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
they actually use a higher deviation
 
02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
they actually use a higher deviation
vermont

02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
they have they successfully
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
they successfully
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
got a plan
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
put in place without a federal court
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
challenged ahead
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
plus or minus 10 percent a 20 deviation
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
similar in maine
 
02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:15.430 align:start position:0%
similar in maine
and

02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
their cases
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
their cases their law actually allows
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
them to divide
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
towns and city wards in half which we
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think we could could get away i
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
mean i
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
hesitate to open up a can of worms but
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
we probably
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
should have started with a greater
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
deviation in fact you're probably
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
drawing at the plans it's not easy
 
02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
drawing at the plans it's not easy
i've

02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
got hold of the software 10 years ago
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
the software this year
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
years ago is a similar there is a i
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
don't know what is on purpose or not but
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
there is a computer down at the base of
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
the lob that
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
any member can sit down at and
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
draw up their own maps the software is
 
02:04:59.199 --> 02:05:00.229 align:start position:0%
draw up their own maps the software is
actually

02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
fairly user friendly so that part of the
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
process is
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually not that terrible but it is
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
terrible deciding how you're going to go
 
02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:08.069 align:start position:0%
terrible deciding how you're going to go
about

02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
doing it and
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
i think probably
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
we may have started from the wrong place
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
which is minimizing the deviation they
 
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
probably should have started
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
with giving every town its own base
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
district and then
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
combined smaller town
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
combine smaller towns with other small
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
towns combine smaller towns with
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring larger towns putting full
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
terriels i think they should have uh
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
they should have they should have
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
done that first and then worry about the
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
deviations uh
 
02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:38.950 align:start position:0%
deviations uh
last

02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
even though you would have a larger
 
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
deviation that i think the public would
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
still be satisfied with it
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
and it would still
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
it would still survive a federal court
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
challenge and um
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
and finally i'll say my district is one
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
that i don't understand why the majority
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
drew it the way it is um
 
02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.750 align:start position:0%
drew it the way it is um
um

02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:00.830 align:start position:0%
um
durham

02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
durham
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
durham um
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
durham gets a base district with four
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
people which is which is fine we um we
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
took the last 10 years we were combined
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
with madbury for six
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
but they decided that madbury should go
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
for lee and dover ward 4
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even sure exactly where
 
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of dover ward 4 is i do
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
know the southern boundary of butts
 
02:06:24.159 --> 02:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
know the southern boundary of butts
madbury

02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
madbury
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
along its entire length and those are
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
three communities which um
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
so those madbury and lee for example
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
they're in the same school district with
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
durham um so
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's understandable it makes sense for
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
those to be together but i'm not sure
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
why particularly makes sense
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
for those three towns to also be with
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
that one ward in dover or anyone who
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
wore it in dover you know i'm
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm prepared for that plan to
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
pass and i'll have to educate myself
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
more about dover politics because
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody will have to run in a
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
floatario that has
 
02:07:00.159 --> 02:07:01.830 align:start position:0%
floatario that has
27

02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
27
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
300 something
 
02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.149 align:start position:0%
300 something
uh

02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
about 27 500 people
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
including you know
 
02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
including you know
including

02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
those three towns and then then they
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat randomly selected ward of uh
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
the city to the north and not that
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
not that dover and durham and maverick
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
lee are in a different uh planets or
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
anything but there's uh
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
especially with the local politics don't
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
really interact that much even though
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
it's a very short distance
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
and there's certainly much worse
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
good luck with the process i know it's i
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
know it's not easy and certainly no
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
matter what you draw nobody's going to
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
be satisfied with it and also you don't
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
really know
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
what the voters are going to do
 
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
next year when we actually send them out
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
there to vote and the
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
other point i mean is like this one's
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
very important this is the first
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
this is the first uh
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
apportionment since the 2020 election
 
02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
apportionment since the 2020 election
and

02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
the january
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
16th 2021 insurrection which i
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
personally view as a very traumatic
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
historical event even i know not
 
02:08:07.119 --> 02:08:08.470 align:start position:0%
historical event even i know not
everybody

02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
around the table feels that way but
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
those things are very sensitive parties
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
are very divided and the elections are
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
should bring everyone together and
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
should be done fairly in a
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
a non-partisan fashion and
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
so i think we want to have uh the best
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
possible elections both
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we apportion the
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
districts and also then of course in
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
terms of how we conduct the election
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
once the districts are
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
are put in place so
 
02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:39.270 align:start position:0%
are put in place so
um

02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
anyway that's basically i i think
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
basically i think uh
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
you might want to consider going with a
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
larger deviation and then actually
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
respecting the state constitution for
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
the house process it might be uh
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
i know you're
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
i know you're kind of late in the
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
process but i think there probably is
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
still time to you know
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
redo the plan redo a more constitutional
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
plan especially since there's a
 
02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:01.189 align:start position:0%
plan especially since there's a
possibility

02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
there may be a lawsuit based on that i
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't know all right thank you
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
don house from belma
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
belmont excuse me is here uh just
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee members you were handed a
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
package that has
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon now
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the special
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
my name is don house and i'm a resident
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
of belmont which is located in
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
belknap county
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
i created warrant article 26 on fair
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
non-partisan redistricting that appeared
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
on belmont's march
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
2021 town election
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
this one article passed with a strong
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
majority of voters expressing their
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
preference for a fair non-partisan
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
74 towns in new hampshire have passed
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
similar resolutions
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
transparency and fairness are crucial to
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
restore voter confidence in our election
 
02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:02.069 align:start position:0%
restore voter confidence in our election
process

02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
i've reviews that i've reviewed the
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
proposed district map by this committee
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
and other groups such as open democracy
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
based on population alone
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
eight of the 11 towns and cities in
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
belknap county meet the criteria for
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
their own representation
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
however none of the maps proposed give
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
all eight of these towns their own
 
02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
all eight of these towns their own
representation

02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
the feedback from belknap county voters
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
shared on october 19th hearing
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
indicated that tilton alton
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
gilford meredith and barnstead should
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
have their own representative
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
instead of sharing rep with other towns
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
all of the proposals disregarded this
 
02:10:41.119 --> 02:10:43.669 align:start position:0%
all of the proposals disregarded this
feedback

02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think the most important principles
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
for redistricting belknap county are to
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
apply the principles in this order
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
each town that has a population of at
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
least 34 or 44 should receive its own
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
towns with populations less than that
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
can be combined with a plateau district
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
laconia should remain intact
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
towns are best served by representatives
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
that are elected from their own town or
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
the smallest floaterial district that
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
combines towns
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
the smaller the district the better the
 
02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
the smaller the district the better the
representation

02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
based on their population some town
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
should be given multiple representatives
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
the use of ploterial districts
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
and combining two adjacent towns to
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
share representatives should be
 
02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
share representatives should be
minimized

02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
minimized
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
if any towns remain unassigned after
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
these first principles are applied then
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
larger deviations should be considered
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
i applied these principles to build up
 
02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:40.870 align:start position:0%
i applied these principles to build up
county

02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
and as as everyone says we get we should
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
get 18 representatives
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
this one everyone's agreement with
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
but in terms of when i apply my criteria
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
above alton would get one rep with
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
another floatarial rep with barnstead
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
barnstein would get one rep with another
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
plotarial rep with alton
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
belmont would receive two reps
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
center harbor new hampton would share a
 
02:12:04.239 --> 02:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
center harbor new hampton would share a
forterial

02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
forterial
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
guilford would have their own two reps
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
laconia would have five reps
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
meredith would have two reps
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
new hampton and center harbor as i said
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
sheriff rotarial
 
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
stamberton gets one rep and tilt in one
 
02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:19.589 align:start position:0%
stamberton gets one rep and tilt in one
rep

02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
rep
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
nine of the eleven towns and cities get
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
their own representation in my scenario
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
the two towns with populations less than
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
that are combined in full tarial
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
now contrast that with the proposed plan
 
02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
now contrast that with the proposed plan
for

02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
belmont which takes away their two
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
representatives now
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
and combines belmont
 
02:12:39.199 --> 02:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
and combines belmont
with

02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
ward 4 and laconia
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
and gilmanton so they now have four reps
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
so that to me is going in the wrong
 
02:12:46.639 --> 02:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
so that to me is going in the wrong
direction

02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
and as
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
some of you probably
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
for some of you will probably object to
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
my scenario because of the deviations
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
would might exceed the general rule of
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
plus or minus 10 5
 
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
i've reviewed the supreme court
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
decisions that this plus or minus five
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
percent is based on
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
and the u.s supreme court has allowed
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
for greater deviations when there is a
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
legitimate constitutional purpose and it
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
seems to me like
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
adhering to the new hampshire
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
constitution about what town should
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
receive their representatives is a
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate constitutional purpose
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that redistricting processes
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
become too focused on this general rule
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
and ignore the new hampshire
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
constitution rule
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
concerning towns having their own state
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative when they meet the
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
my other feedback is on the two
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
congressional districts for new
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire i know you've heard a lot
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
about this already
 
02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
they should be drawn to minimize the
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
number of towns that switch districts
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
most of the towns in the southeastern
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
portion should stay with a single
 
02:13:48.159 --> 02:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
portion should stay with a single
district

02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
the proposed maps are clearly
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered for the political benefit
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
of republicans
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
long-standing competitive districts
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
that have been drawn by republicans are
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
now being redrawn
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
the existing congregate congressional
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
districts have remained nearly the same
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
for 140 years
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
but now they're shifting them
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
this break with long-standing precedent
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
further underscores how fundamentally
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
unfair these lines are
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
both congressional seats should remain
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
competitive mirroring the state as a
 
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:21.750 align:start position:0%
competitive mirroring the state as a
whole

02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
the maps as proposed don't meet the
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
criteria that most voters indicated were
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
important to them
 
02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
important to them
the

02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
maps need to better reflect the feedback
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
from the voters
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate the gerrymandering that has
 
02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
spoiled the maps
 
02:14:36.639 --> 02:14:38.629 align:start position:0%
spoiled the maps
redistricting

02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
impacts many issues in our daily lives
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
the drawing of districts lines not only
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
determines who is elected
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
but also how the state's financial
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
resources are allocated for schools
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals roads and other services
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in new hampshire deserves far
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
better than the majority of party maps
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
released so far
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
please revise these maps to reflect the
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
voter feedback that you have heard today
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr house
 
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you to the
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing our testimony
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
i am brian sullivan i represent sullivan
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
county district one as does lee oxenham
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
who spoke earlier
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
the towns in sullivan one are plainfield
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
today i'm going to focus
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
primarily on the sullivan county map
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
to start off
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
i believe this the southern part of the
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
county has been undone pretty well
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make many changes
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
and frankly
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's been working and will continue to
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
work the only change was really shifting
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
unity and goshen
 
02:16:01.599 --> 02:16:02.550 align:start position:0%
unity and goshen
and

02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's fine it keeps things pretty much
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
the way they are
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the northern part of the county
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's some problems
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
and as
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham mentioned earlier
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of that problem is corbyn park
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
you can't see corbin park on this map
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
but it's a very large game preserve
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of the northern
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
section of
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and it really splits things up
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
and frankly it splits up my district now
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
because of the corbin park
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
i live almost on the edge of corbin park
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
the only way i could get to plainfield
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
part of my district
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
without leaving um grantham
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
to go into enfield in lebanon would be
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
to drive a jeep track that's close to my
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
house and um
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
frankly i wouldn't put my f-150 on that
 
02:16:57.599 --> 02:16:58.629 align:start position:0%
frankly i wouldn't put my f-150 on that
track

02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
track
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
it is a very rough road you can't get
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
there from here
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
so essentially
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to split grantham and
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
springfield from cornish and plainfield
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
what doesn't make sense is splitting up
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
playing field in cornish
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
those two towns i heard so many say
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
earlier two peas in a pod that is indeed
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
the case they have
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
more in common than probably any other
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
two towns in the in the county
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i believe it's essential to keep
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
those two towns together
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
cornish and plainfield
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
are a community
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
this map also has grantham as a separate
 
02:17:43.599 --> 02:17:44.709 align:start position:0%
this map also has grantham as a separate
district

02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit short
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
of voters for a separate district but
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
it's close
 
02:17:49.519 --> 02:17:50.549 align:start position:0%
it's close
um

02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
rather than combining plainfield or i'm
 
02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
rather than combining plainfield or i'm
sorry

02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
yes playing field with croydon in
 
02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:58.309 align:start position:0%
yes playing field with croydon in
springfield

02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
springfield
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
you could put either croydon
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
or springfield with grantham
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
and perhaps put croydon or springfield
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
with sunapee
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
those two towns have been made their own
 
02:18:09.679 --> 02:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
those two towns have been made their own
districts

02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
they could take and they're both a
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
little bit short of voters for their own
 
02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:15.349 align:start position:0%
little bit short of voters for their own
district

02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
so i think those two combinations could
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
work um
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
the other district that's
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
bit of a mess is
 
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
cornish newport and goshen again it goes
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
from one side of the county the other
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
cornish and newport has has been pointed
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
out only are joined by a point
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
little of anything in common unlike
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
cornish and plainfield
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
and frankly you could have newport and
 
02:18:47.679 --> 02:18:48.709 align:start position:0%
and frankly you could have newport and
goshen

02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
goshen
 
02:18:48.719 --> 02:18:49.589 align:start position:0%
goshen
form

02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
a two
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
seat district without including cornish
 
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:54.430 align:start position:0%
seat district without including cornish
so

02:18:54.430 --> 02:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:56.309 align:start position:0%
so

02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not telling you exactly how you need
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
the one thing i think is essential keep
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
cornish and plainfield together
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
combine springfield and grantham as you
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
see fit
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
and leave newport and goshen as a duo
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
with two seats
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
i think that would work and i thank you
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you very much for
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
allowing us to speak
 
02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:38.070 align:start position:0%
allowing us to speak
um

02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
most of what i have to say has been said
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
before and i miss judge you want to just
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
i may know but you want to just say
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
where you're from
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to do that okay
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
my name is karine dodge and i live in
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
derry thank you okay
 
02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:54.469 align:start position:0%
derry thank you okay
um

02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
most of what i intended to say has
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
already been said i don't need to say it
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
again even though i believe it with all
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
my heart i i will make this incredibly
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
short and ask your permission
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
to read
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
another person's very very short letter
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
the minority proposal congressional maps
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
are as unfair to republican voters in
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
district two
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
as they are to democratic voters
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
in district one and all this is so that
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
the republican party will have an unfair
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
advantage in winning elections for the
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
next 10 years
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
i feel that you were taking away my vote
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
please stop the gerrymandering
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
and now i'm speaking for celia randall
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
who is a um a voter in brookfield
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
my name is celia randall i live in
 
02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:56.150 align:start position:0%
my name is celia randall i live in
brookfield

02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
brookfield
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
i am writing to express my outrage at
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
what i am hearing reported on nhpr and
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
in reading online articles
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire journalists concerning
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
the outright partisan manipulation of my
 
02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
the outright partisan manipulation of my
vote

02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
the proposed gerrymandered plans ensures
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
a district that will produce a
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
republican outcome and another that will
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
likely favor
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
democrats this plan negates our choices
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
and creates more of the partisan
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
conflict which we have all witnessed for
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the past several years this is unfair to
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constituents demand of you
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to put in place a redistricting plan
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
that is fair and evenly divided based on
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
population shifts not political parties
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
not either one of them
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
please do not invalidate my voice and
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
and members you have a letter
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
from her
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
i have submitted written testimony but
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm actually um speaking differently
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
today um and i thank you for the time to
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
be here
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
um you're gonna hear from me that i'm
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
here because i want fair maps um and i'm
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
sorry to have to be can you get a little
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic just so everybody can
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
hear you um
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm here to ask for fair maps and i
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
guess i welcome the opportunity to
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
address this again but i'm also
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
disappointed that after hundreds of
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
people at public hearings and thousands
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
of people over the 74 town warrant votes
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
have asked for fair maps we still have
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
to ask for fair mats
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
my testimony is with reference mostly to
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
the majority version of the
 
02:22:47.359 --> 02:22:48.790 align:start position:0%
the majority version of the
congressional

02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
congressional
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
district map
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you represent the
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
voices of all the voters
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire not just those who
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
voted for you
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
your obligation
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
is to your full constituency not stephen
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
stepanek not the incumbent
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
and not the game playing that was
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
referred to by an earlier person about
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
building power and seniority in congress
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
your obligation is to every citizen to
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that their vote will matter that
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
their candidate regardless of party has
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
a fair chance of being elected
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
the people have spoken loudly and
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
clearly they want fair maps
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
thousands of constituents in over 74
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
towns have overwhelmingly voted for fair
 
02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:34.710 align:start position:0%
towns have overwhelmingly voted for fair
maps

02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
maps
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
i urge you not to dismiss the relevance
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
and value of those town warrant votes
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
most people cannot be here today
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
or tomorrow at 5. they work they have
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
child care they have classes
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
the distance and their personal health
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
which i have a huge concern standing
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
very close to this map
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
that town vote is their message their
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
and their voice in this mapping project
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
please heed their voice
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
your own legislature through bipartisan
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
effort the past two legislative sessions
 
02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
have also voted for fairness
 
02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
i have to repeat this the people want
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
fair maths it is your responsibility to
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
see that this happens
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
the majority map
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
for the congressional district is a
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
waste of everyone's time
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
it does not even pass the most basic
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
parameter of being visually compact
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
it does a disservice to all new
 
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens and our democracy
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
it most likely will be voted down by
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
your colleagues in full session
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
it would hopefully be vetoed by governor
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
sununu as it does not pass his smell
 
02:24:48.479 --> 02:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
sununu as it does not pass his smell
test

02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
test
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
it may end up in the courts
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
why put forth this wasted effort
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
chairman griffin
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
you are here because the citizens of
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
goffstown elected you
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to restate
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
the vote of the goffstown people a very
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
republican town of march of 2020 where
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming majority 972-642
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming majority of your
 
02:25:16.399 --> 02:25:18.469 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming majority of your
constituency

02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
constituency
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of quote

redrawing the state's maps in a fair
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
manner for effective representation of
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%

congressional district maps meet that
 
02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
congressional district maps meet that
standard

02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
standard
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
chairman griffin and committee members

number of representatives

with a population of something around 50
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
50 000 we were entitled to four seats
 
02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:56.230 align:start position:0%
50 000 we were entitled to four seats
in

02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
didn't get them we got zero and now we
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
have four thank you
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
i would point out
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the key thing
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
change to the
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
which says which we all voted to uphold
 
02:27:20.479 --> 02:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
which says which we all voted to uphold
says

02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
the key things
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
a town award shall have its own district
 
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
of one or more representative
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
seats no differences it just if you
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
20 uh 12 sayings i looked i made a
 
02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:43.190 align:start position:0%
20 uh 12 sayings i looked i made a
spreadsheet

02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
went through the math
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
and looked at how many
 
02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:48.469 align:start position:0%
and looked at how many
districts

02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
qualified and didn't get a seat
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
it would surprise you probably to learn
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
there are 62 towns
 
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
that did not
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
meant were
 
02:28:01.080 --> 02:28:02.950 align:start position:0%
meant were
unconstitutionally

02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh drawn
 
02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:06.790 align:start position:0%
uh drawn
62.

02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
62.
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
the town of pelham the town of sullivan
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
town of atkinson qualified for
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
seats with no
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
need for plateau
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
didn't get them
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i do want to thank you for doing that
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
for pelham
 
02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
i will intend to this year
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
go through the same process
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
to see and i'd be glad to share that
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
information if i feel
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
that either on one side or the other
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of our
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
constitution and would hope you would
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
rectify those uh i would probably like
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
to ask you two things is i'd like to get
 
02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
the database or for the population i'll
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
get that from somebody
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and who would i send it the
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
information to
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
that i would produce relatives the
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh constitutionality of the district
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
but that's it that's what my
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr lind uh just for general
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
information when you go to the house
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
website and you're looking at our maps
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
you will see in each community a box
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
and that box will have the population
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
number in it
 
02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
the program we used
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
has those populations loaded into it and
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
it is the same as the census data
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
next signed up to speak is
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative suzanne smith
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
she's still here or not
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's harder to see from down here than
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
you think all right i'm not seeing her
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.230 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
uh

02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
from rochester i'm sorry i didn't get
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah polana hunt hawkins from
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
rochester thank you so i live in
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
rochester i think we have a really
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
dynamic and competitive electorate there
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
um and frankly i think that some of
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
these these proposed map changes aim to
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate that
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
one of them is in so in rochester
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
currently we have nine house seats that
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
span six wards
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh the majority map also breaks
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
rochester ward five out with milton and
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
it creates a very bizarrely shaped
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
district and no offense to milton but i
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that milton and rochester have
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
very different needs and it would be
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
great to keep rochester all within
 
02:30:28.389 --> 02:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
rochester districts um
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up at the
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
stratford county listening session was
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
not uh was
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
just person after person was talking
 
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
about executive council district two and
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
i really think something should be done
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
finally um with congressional district
 
02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
finally um with congressional district
one

02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
i came of age uh playing sonic the
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog is a
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
very great video game but it's a very
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
terrible congressional district
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's all these little like bumps and
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
stuff um i think that that's something
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
that should really be taken a look at
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
