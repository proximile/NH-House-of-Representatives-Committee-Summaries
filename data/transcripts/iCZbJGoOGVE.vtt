Before we get to the business of the day the chair recognizes Representative Nutter.

71
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.500
Thank you Mr.

72
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.000
Chairman I'd like to make a motion to reconsider our actions on House Bill 615.

73
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.500
Representative Nutter makes a motion to reconsider 624, correct?

74
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.500
614.

75
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500
614.

76
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500
614.

77
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
614.

78
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500
Isn't that right?

79
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.000
We didn't vote on 614.

80
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We voted on 624.

81
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
No, we did.

82
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

83
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Okay, back up.

84
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
No, it's 624.

85
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's 624.

86
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It's 624.

87
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We are currently on the agenda.

88
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

89
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I'm confused.

90
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Okay, back up.

91
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
No, it's 624.

92
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It's 624.

93
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
You are correct.

94
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.500
I jumped ahead of myself.

95
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.500
624.

96
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:44.000
Okay, so Representative Nauter has made a motion to reconsider our action on HB 624.

97
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Representative Bernardi.

98
00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I second that motion.ernardy seconds the motion that we reconsider our action on house bill six to four this is a non this is a debatable motion but not the substance of the bill the only thing that's debatable is whether or not there is a good reason for reconsideration and And I'm told that Representative Michael Harrington, who was unable to vote last Friday, was unable to vote because he was taken out of the room because of a family emergency.

99
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So that is adequate cause for a motion of reconsideration.

100
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.500
Does anyone else have any discussion of the idea of reconsideration?

101
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.000
Representative Callie Pitts is recognized.

102
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I have two questions.

103
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I have two questions, and one of them is, does this need two-thirds or does it need a simple majority?

104
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And the second question is really more than a question.

105
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's really a statement.

106
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:10.000
The last thing I heard before I signed off last week troubled me so much that I'm going to mention it today.

107
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.500
And it was, is this the game you want to play?

108
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.000
And I think that that troubled me.

109
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And I take offense at that.

110
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I don't think anybody here, I'm going to speak for myself, not anybody else.

111
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.500
I do not take this as a game or else I would not be sitting here for five hours.

112
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.500
I would not be doing 10 hours worth of research or more.

113
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500
It's not a game to me.

114
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.000
I take it very seriously.

115
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.500
And that remark offended me.

116
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.000
Thank you, Representative Kelly Pitts.

117
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The answer to your question is simple majority.

118
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The chair now recognizes Representative Somsich for a question or a comment.

119
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Thank you, Mr.

120
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Chairman.

121
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I am quite surprised by this motion, and it seems to me a blatant political motion.

122
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.500
I can understand that situations arise where someone may not be able to vote when they're there.

123
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:37.500
If this were in the normal session in the House and you weren't in your seat, you couldn't vote, your vote just didn't count.

124
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.000
That's the way it is.

125
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And I thought that we, Mr.

126
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Chairman, you and I came to an agreement that was mutually agreeable, that would do what we intended to do with a floor amendment.

127
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And I thought that was a genuine act of bipartisanship for change.

128
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.500
This reconsideration, on the other hand, is a blatant partisanship going on here.

129
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.500
So I'm really disappointed about that.

130
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.500
Okay.

131
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.500
Thank you, Representative Somsich.

132
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.000
Seeing no other hands raised.

133
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Representative Nader.

134
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Thank you, Mr.

135
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Chairman.

136
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:40.500
The representative who missed the boat called me at home afterwards and he explained the situation to me and it was an emergency, a very personal matter that I'm not going to share with you.

137
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:47.500
But if I was in that situation, I would have left the room too.

138
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.500
It was serious.

139
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.500
Thank you, Representative Nutter.

140
00:10:51.500 --> 00:11:02.000
I Not sure of a loose hand when I first here, but I take a chance that it was Representative Boxman.

141
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
My question has to do with the amendment.

142
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.500
Are we going to have an opportunity to deal with the amendment now?

143
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.000
Questions about the substance of the bill are not in order.

144
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.500
Right now, we're only debating whether to reconsider it or not.

145
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.500
Representative McGee.

146
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.500
And don't forget to get close to your microphone, please.

147
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

148
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.500
Chairman.

149
00:11:34.500 --> 00:12:24.000
That was basically the substance of my question as well which is that where we left the bill I thought when we had the vote was that we were planning to make some word changes that would make it acceptable and bipartisan and now it sounds like we're going to put Representative Harrington's vote back in and override that so that there is no bipartisanship in terms of how the language is crafted is that what i'm understanding thank you uh representative mick williams is that what i'm understanding is that what is happening we've been asked to reconsider.

150
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Yes.

151
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Representative Williams.

152
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Thank you, Chair Vose.

153
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.500
I respectfully request a challenge on this specific motion.

154
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:48.000
My understanding is that due to Robert's rules, if you want to reconsider, you need to have a vote on the prevailing side that wishes to reconsider.

155
00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:24.000
This vote was 10-10, and so I would request that staff take a look at the procedure for this because i don't believe that this is allowed thank you for that question i talked to the clerk about that this morning and because there was no prevailing side anybody can make a motion to reconsider representative thomas thank you mr chair i'd just like to make comment comment on the last comment.

156
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
We are under Mason's rules, not Robert's rules.

157
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And in the case of committees, we do not have to be on the prevailing side to make a motion to reconsider.

158
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.500
Only when you're at the House session.

159
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.500
Thank you.

160
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.000
Representative Cretion is recognized for a comment.

161
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Thank you, Chair.

162
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.500
I just had a question again about the amendment.

163
00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:10.000
When we left it on Friday, we were told that we didn't have time to consider delaying the vote on this till today in order to leave time for an amendment.

164
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So I'm surprised that we've decided we have time for reconsideration is that something that you can explain the explanation is that a member asked for reconsideration which is a legitimate request does anybody else need to speak doesn't appear that that's the case.

165
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.500
So I'll ask the clerk to call the roll.

166
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.500
Mr.

167
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.000
Chairman, I do request to speak, please.

168
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Okay, Representative Sonsich.

169
00:14:44.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Well, in light of the fact that this looks pretty bipartisan to me, I would request that Representative Harrington provide a certified letter confirming his medical emergency at home to the partisan to me, I would request that Representative Harrington provide a certified letter confirming his medical emergency at home to the committee members.

170
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Noted.

171
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Thank you very much.

172
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
All right.

173
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.500
Let's take the call on the roll.

174
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.500
Representative Merner, you have the floor.

175
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.500
On the motion, reconsider.

176
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
Representative Thomas.

177
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500
Yes.

178
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500
Representative Harrington.

179
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.500
Yes.

180
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.500
Excuse me.

181
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:42.500
I represent you didn't don't forget to turn on your video when you vote.

182
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500
Okay.

183
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500
Yeah.

184
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500
Okay.

185
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
Yes.

186
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:59.000
I think you can see me now daughter yes clerk yes representative homula yes representative breast Yes.

187
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Oh, sorry, no.

188
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I vote no.

189
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Representative Kelly Pitts.

190
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
No.

191
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Representative Meehan.

192
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
No.

193
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Representative Oxenham.

194
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
No.

195
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Representative Vincent?

196
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
No.

197
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Representative McGee?

198
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
No.

199
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Representative McWilliams?

200
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Package coming in, Linda.

201
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Representative McWilliams?

202
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
No.

203
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Thank you.

204
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Representative Feess?

205
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
No.

206
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Thank you.

207
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Representative Feachin?

208
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
No.

209
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Representative Pimentel?

210
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
No.

211
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Representative Hachel?

212
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
No.

213
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And the Chair?

214
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Chair votes yes.

215
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Reconsideration passes.

216
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:06.500
Reconsideration has passed, so we will now reconsider HB 624, and the chair recognizes Representative Nauter for a motion.

217
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.500
Thank you, Mr.

218
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.500
Chairman.

219
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.500
I move to pass on House Bill 624.

220
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.000
Representative Nutter moves to pass on House Bill 624.

221
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Representative Bernardi.

222
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I second the motion.

223
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It has been moved and seconded that HB 624 we voted ought to pass.

224
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Is there any discussion?

225
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Representative Oxenam.

226
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.500
Yes, I'd like to move an amendment.

227
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.500
Do you have a written amendment from OLS?

228
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:47.500
That would not have been possible under the circumstances, now would it?

229
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:53.500
It would have been possible, but I guess you didn't do it.

230
00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:04.000
We should have assumed that we'd have this change and this bill would be brought back to us in this manner?

231
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:15.500
Could it be put off until later in the day so that we have an opportunity to submit an amendment to OLS, Mr.

232
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500
Chairman?

233
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.500
No, I don't think we have time to do that.

234
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.000
So we need to dispose of this matter now.

235
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Representative Prezni, did you have a comment to make about this bill?

236
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Thank you.

237
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Representative Prezni, did you have a comment to make about this bill?

238
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Representative Cambrils?

239
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
No comment.

240
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Representative Samcic?

241
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Yes, Mr.

242
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Chairman.

243
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.500
I really have to object to the procedures here.

244
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:21.000
On the one hand, last time we heard that we didn't have enough time to discuss everything, and then when the vote happened and it was tied, then we decided the way to resolve it would be with a floor amendment, which I thought was a very good gesture of bipartisanship.

245
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:55.500
Now this is a blatant partisan attack on everything we've tried to build together here, and that will have repercussions later on for sure, but I don't see why an amendment that was basically supported by everybody last time would not be in order at this time, and as Representative Oxenham mentioned, there's no way we could have anticipated that we should have gotten this ready ahead of time.

246
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:04.000
So if you're gonna be blindsiding us on a regular basis, I'd like to know that now.

247
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.500
Thank you for that comment.

248
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.000
The floor amendment idea is still on the table.

249
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Representative Callie Pitts.

250
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Don't forget to unmute.

251
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:33.000
All I wanted to know is if the amendment was still going to be not put off to the Senate and not put off to the floor, but be able to be entertained in this committee.

252
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.500
know what the rules are once you move on to business and once the vote is final.

253
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:49.000
So I would ask that we ask the clerk what the procedure is on that.

254
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And I don't think that's out of order.

255
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.500
Again, if I'm playing a game, then I got to know the rules.

256
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:08.000
And I think that Paul is the one that can tell us what the procedure is this.

257
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Because once the vote is final and we've moved on to something else, is it like a football that once you pass the next play, you can't protest?

258
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.500
I'd like to know that and I'd like to have a definitive ruling on that.

259
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.500
Right easy Reagan.

260
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.500
Representative Harrington.

261
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.500
Representative Parshall.

262
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:43.500
Yes my concern over the passage of this is that it sets precedents for the future.

263
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:55.500
And that will mean that any bill will be able to be brought back again for reconsidering at an opportune time without amending it.

264
00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:08.000
I just think that sets a very bad precedence that I do hope this is not the way we are moving forward to conduct business.

265
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Thank you.

266
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Thank you, Representative Vincent.

267
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

268
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.500
Chairman.

269
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:24.500
I was wondering if it was possible where all this Zoom is all new to us.

270
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.000
And I know you've laid down some ground rules.

271
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:41.000
I was wondering if it was possible if we could actually put these on paper so we can all understand what the rules are.

272
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000
So then it won't be any variation or any challenges, so to speak, in the future.

273
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Thank you.

274
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
That's a good request.

275
00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.500
I will make sure every member of the committee gets a copy of the guidelines.

276
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:08.000
They're not rules, but I'll make sure every member of the committee gets a copy.

277
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Representative Immantell.

278
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Don't forget to unmute.

279
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Thank you, Mr.

280
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Chairman.

281
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.500
I strongly object to this continuing that we should not be voting to override the original vote.

282
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.500
Thank you.

283
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.500
Thank you.

284
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.500
Representative Bernardi.

285
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:51.500
I'd like to speak against the concept of this amendment and as was discussed last week the entire premise that corporations are bad and need to be punished to pay full freight and and small people are the ones who deserve $150.00.

286
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.000
The team is not in that argument.

287
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:09.500
We considered a bill last Friday where we heard the TUC tell us that the telephone company and the cable companies could not pay for removing a telephone pole.

288
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:19.000
They had to deal with just the urgent business of their company because they did not have the resources.

289
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:34.000
So the concept in principle that corporations have the money to pay these big unnecessary fees, I believe is fundamentally flawed and I totally reject the concept of the amendment.

290
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Representative Rezni.

291
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Thank you, Mr.

292
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Chairman.

293
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:51.500
This bill is about justice and I believe that if justice is blind and impartial, then access to justice should also be impartial.

294
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.500
Thank you.

295
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.500
everyone who has so far represented a nodder.

296
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.500
Thank you, Mr.

297
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.500
Chairman.

298
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:09.000
I just wanted to reiterate that any representative has the right to ask for consideration.

299
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So this is not something that we just made up.

300
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Correct.

301
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Thank you.

302
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Anybody else in the room have a Thomas?

303
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
It appears that everybody, Representative Thomas.

304
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Thank you, Mr.

305
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Chair, for my question.

306
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
I would like to reiterate that Representative Dobbs is correct.

307
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Anyone has a right to vote for reconsideration.

308
00:25:38.000 --> 00:26:49.500
This has happened before in my six years in in this committee and it has happened before where certain understandings were there and then because of maybe administrative discussions afterwards the situation's changed it's not unusual but i will say that this is a central committee bill so a secret committee has the opportunity to listen to arguments for whether or not we want amendments and then there's also the opportunity for a floor amendment before the house and again there's also opportunity to reach the other side of the room to have amendments here as well so i personally feel that letting this field go as is will open up the door to lose opportunities for further discussion and is why i'm in favor of the wpp as it stands right now okay thank you representative thomas it is now 10 25.

309
00:26:49.500 --> 00:27:05.500
we are 25 minutes beyond the time at which we were supposed to start our first public hearing, but we can't do so as long as we're involved in this voting process.

310
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:50.000
So I just want to alert everybody to that fact and remind them that we have a second public hearing at 11 o'clock, 1130 rather, no 11 o'clock and we'll have to start promptly on top of that is there anybody else who uh wishes to speak i can see three hand raised hands raised i'm not sure if you forgot to lower your hand from the last time or if you really want to speak if you could wave at me representative mcgee yes thank you mr chairman.

311
00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:11.000
My comment actually goes directly to the time issue, which seems to be at the root cause of why we're rushing through bills and not able to express some of the issues that are really germane to our positions on those bills.

312
00:28:11.000 --> 00:29:03.500
And I had sent you a note asking whether we could simply add another remote meeting during the week, because we normally do have two days a week that we would meet to get through our bills because this time constraint is based on when the bills have to be out of committee and the fact that we can only meet once a week and I just wanted you to know that eDNA is meeting twice a week there is not it's an I think it's an arbitrary and artificial constraint that we are unable to have more than one day a week for meetings.

313
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.500
And it is leading to all of these other problems.

314
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:29.000
So I would ask you to reconsider the note that I sent you and actually discuss how it is that other committees are actually able to meet multiple times a week when you basically told us that that was not possible.

315
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Thank you.

316
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Thank you for the question, Representative.

317
00:29:34.000 --> 00:30:13.000
There are some smaller committees in the House like Fish and Game, Veterans Affairs, a couple of other small committees that don't have a lot of business to conduct during the course of a session matter of fact fish and game was hoping to dispose of all six of their bills in one day so if that should happen we've been told by house leadership that we may be able to have a second meeting in a week.

318
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:29.000
It would use the same format as the meetings we're conducting right now, but we may get at least one and maybe more weeks where we can have multiple meetings if necessary.

319
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:51.500
But if we don't put that on the schedule, then we're going to continue to run into the problem that we're having now, which is that we're rushing through things that require additional consideration and not actually completing our job before we pass them off.

320
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:59.000
Well, we have to deal with the, we have to play the hand we're dealt.

321
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Okay, Representative Oxen.

322
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:11.000
I want to strongly protest the notion that the hearing on my bill is being truncated because of this issue.

323
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:22.500
I think that the only fair thing is to move every hearing forward starting at the time after which this vote is concluded.

324
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500
Okay, thank you.

325
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.000
Seeing no other representative Homolot.

326
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Thank you, Chair.

327
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:40.500
I just want to comment that I actually agree with Representative Bernardi and Representative, I'm sorry, I'm so bad to say your name.

328
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500
All right.

329
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500
Thanks.

330
00:31:44.500 --> 00:32:02.500
I want to say that one of the things that we heard in testimony was the difficulties that the utilities have quite frankly in doing anything above and beyond public what they provide to the public.

331
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:40.000
testimony was the difficulties that the utilities have quite frankly in doing anything above and beyond public what they provide to the public in many instances and I do think it is appropriate to lower the fees for this particular with this bill tries to do to lower the fees but I do think it's important that it lowers the fees for consumers and it lowers the fees for those businesses and utilities as well.

332
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So I think it is an appropriate as is and thank you very much.

333
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Thank you, Representative.

334
00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Seeing no other hands raised for discussion, I'm going to call the vote and ask the clerk, the acting to read the roll call to clarify what we're going on oh okay we're voting on a motion of ought to pass on hb 624.

335
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.500

Representative Vincent.

377
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500
No.

378
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.500
Representative Oxenham?

379
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.500
No.

380
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.500

Representative Pimentel?

393
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.500
No.

394
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.500
Representative Pimentel?

395
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.500
No.

396
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.500
Representative Pimentel?

397
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.500

Representative Pimentel?

401
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.500
No.

402
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500
Thank you.

403
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:50.500
no representative pimentel representative pimentel you're muted mr pin pinitel and i would suggest that uh represent pimentel needs to show his video right where is he perhaps he was called away might have been an emergency represented partial no Representative Paschal?

404
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
No.

405
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500
And the chair?

406
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500
Representative votes.

407
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.500
Chair votes yes.

408
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:04.000
So with one not voting, the vote is 11 to 9.

409
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Okay.

410
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
So the motion to opt to pass on HB 624 passes 11 to 9.

411
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Will there be a minority report, Representative Sausage?

412
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Yes, there will be.

413
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.500
I will write that report.

414
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.500
Thank you.

415
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:29.000
And I also request a right to speak on a motion.

416
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
What motion is that?

417
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I would like to move to reconsider 624.

418
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
more.

419
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.500
Well, since we already reconsidered that, I don't see a need to reconsider it again.

420
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500
Motions in order.

421
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.500
Yep.

422
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:55.500
We were just told any representative can make that motion, so I'm making it.

423
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.500
All right.

424
00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:06.000
I'll let you make it, but you've got to make a solid case for allowing a reconsideration.

425
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
So Representative Somsich has moved reconsideration.

426
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Is there a second?

427
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Second.

428
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.500
It's moved and seconded that we reconsider HB 6224.

429
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.000
Is there any discussion on the motion to reconsider?

430
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Yes.

431
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Representative Callie-Pitts.

432
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000
I was just informed that there is somebody in OLS who can draft an amendment now.

433
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.500
And my confusion, Representative, Mr.

434
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:42.500
Chairman, is that I wouldn't know how to get a paper amendment.

435
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:55.500
But there is somebody in OLS who could draft a friendly amendment, the one we all agreed on yesterday, and they could do it right now.

436
00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.000
And that was told to me by the clerk.

437
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.500
So that is the reason that I would like to reconsider to get that friendly amendment drafted.

438
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:26.000
I just spoke to Paul, and my understanding is once the bill leaves the committee, and I don't know how it leaves the committee either, that an amendment can only be filed on the floor.

439
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.000
So I would hope that we could reconsider and then hold this bill until OLS gets that amendment.

440
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:45.500
And it should only take them, you know, well, I can't speak for them, but they can do it right now.

441
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.500
Thank you.

442
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.500
Representative Sausage.

443
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

444
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.500
Chairman.

445
00:38:53.500 --> 00:39:15.000
The reason I'm also making this motion is because I just heard a couple of comments from at least three representatives in the conference room who gave impressions to me that maybe they had a different take on this bill than I did.

446
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:35.000
I was very much in favor of the sentiment expressed by Representative Harrington last time, how ordinary residents who have an issue with the Site Evaluation Committee project should be able to get a declaratory decision for a small fee.

447
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.500
And we're going to have a question.

448
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.000
And we're going to have a question.

449
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.500
And we're going to have a question.

450
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.000
And we're going to have a question.

451
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.500
And we're going to have a question.

452
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.000
And we're going to have a question.

453
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.500
And we're going to have a question.

454
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.000
And we're going to have a question.

455
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.500
And we're going to have a question.

456
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.000
And we're going to have a question.

457
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.500
And we're going to have a question.

458
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.000
And we're going to have a question.

459
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.500
And we're going to have a question.

460
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.000
And we're going to have a question.

461
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.500
And we're going to have a question.

462
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.000
And we're going to have a question.

463
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.500
And we're going to have a question.

464
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.000
And we're going to have a question.

465
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.500
And we're going to have a question.

466
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.000
And we're going to have a question.

467
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.500
And we're going to have a question.

468
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:55.000
And we be able to get a declaratory decision for a small fee.

469
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:10.000
And it was also mentioned that in previous years, ordinary residents didn't have to pay anything, but businesses and corporations interested in the project were required to pay this fee.

470
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Now I'm hearing we should reduce the fee for everybody, which seems to me to go against the sentiment of the bill originally stated.

471
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:31.500
So I'm a little confused and maybe other representatives are also confused and that's why I'm asking for reconsideration.

472
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.500
Thank you, Representative Vincent.

473
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.500
Thanks again, Mr.

474
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.500
Chairman.

475
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.500
I have a point of clarification.

476
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.500
Thank you, Representative Vincent.

477
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.500
Thanks again, Mr.

478
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.500
Chairman.

479
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.500
I have a point of clarification.

480
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:59.500
So if I'm sitting in the conference room, everything only applies to Zoom, to people that are on Zoom, correct?

481
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:08.500
Meaning if I wanted to do a blue card, I'm not going to file it through the website.

482
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.500
I'm going to be there to file it.

483
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:22.500
And it's important to me because if I was there right now, I could give an amendment to you, correct?

484
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.500
Am I correct with saying that?

485
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.000
No, the same rules apply to everyone.

486
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:42.500
So to actually have to be able to speak in for or against something that comes to testimony, then we have to file through the website, correct?

487
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:56.500
Well, no, not if you're a member of the committee, but if you're an outside member, yes, if you want to speak, you have to file through the...

488
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
Okay, thank you.

489
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.000
Thank you for that clarification.

490
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Representative Voxen.

491
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

492
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.500
Chairman.

493
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:13.000
We were informed on Friday that the SEC is cash strapped.

494
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:24.000
And the only way in which it's able to finance any of its necessary operations is through the collection of these fees.

495
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:48.500
We were further informed that we went through the discussion about making sure that the original concept of the SAC, which is to allow the public access to the process without undue harm and making every possible availability to them to be able to be part of that process.

496
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:57.000
And suddenly we're now being told, oh, it's going to be wide open for corporations as well.

497
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:06.500
This actually is a way of demolishing the, destroying the SEC as an institution, making it incapable of functioning.

498
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:19.500
And if that is your intent, then I think that you should be open about that rather than trying to do it through this backdoor measure.

499
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.000
Thank you for your comment.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:36.500
I don't know how closely you were listening the other day, but I was somewhat shocked to learn that the SEC gets $500,000 a year from the general fund.

501
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:43.500
So to characterize them as being poor, cash starved, I think is a mischaracterization.

502
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.500
Representative Pimentel.

503
00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:56.500
We need to have more information before we can vote on this bill because that is not my understanding of the testimony.

504
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.500
I recognize Representative Pimentel.

505
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500
Sorry Mr.

506
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.000
Chairman for my quick departure.

507
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.500
I was having smelling smoke.

508
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:13.000
I had to go deal with my wood stove downstairs but everything is fine now.

509
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
I'm glad you're safe.

510
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.500
Okay, so everyone who has shown an interest in speaking on this motion to reconsider has spoken.

511
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:29.500
So let's call the roll and vote on reconsideration of HB 624.

512
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.000
On the reconsideration of 624.

513
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.500
Motion was made by Mr.

514
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.500
Chairman.

515
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.500
Who's who's uh okay.

516
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.500
Nevermind.

517
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.500
Representative Thomas.

518
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.500
No.

519
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.500
Representative Harrington.

520
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.500
No.

521
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.500
Representative Noada.

522
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.500
No.

523
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.500
Representative Myrna.

524
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.500
No.

525
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.500
Representative Holot.

526
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.500
No.

527
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.500
Representative Bresni.

528
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.500
No.

529
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.500
Representative Bernadette.

530
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.500
No.

531
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.500
Representative Kembrils.

532
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.500
No.

533
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.500
Representative Jose.

534
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.500
No.

535
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.500
Representative White.

536
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.500
No.

537
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.500
Representative Sausage.

538
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.500
Yes.

539
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.500
Representative Callie Pitts?

540
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.500
Yes.

541
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.500
Representative Meehan?

542
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.500
Yes.

543
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.500
Representative Oxenham?

544
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.500
Yes.

545
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.500
Representative Vincent?

546
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500
Yes.

547
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.500
Representative McGee?

548
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.500
Yes.

549
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:50.500
mcwilliams yes representative crescent yes please representative pimontale yes representative yes Vose?

550
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.500
Vose votes no.

551
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.500
Chairman, point of order.

552
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.000
Reconsideration fails 11 to 10.

553
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Okay, reconsideration of HB 624 has failed by a vote of 11 to 10.

554
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.500
Who asked for a point of order?

555
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.500
I did.

556
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:14.500
Representative Douglas Thomas should be on video when he votes.

557
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500
He's right there.

558
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.000
Representative Harrington is on video.

559
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
No, Douglas Thomas.

560
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
He's in the room.

561
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
He's right there.

562
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
He's in the room.

563
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.500
Oh, he's in the room.

564
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.500
I see his name on here as well.

565
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.500
My apology then.

566
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.000
His name appears blank on my Zoom.

567
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
All right, thank you.

568
00:47:41.000 --> 00:48:11.500
All right, now that that matter has been disposed of at the relatively late hour of 1042, I'd like to open the public hearing on HB 394, a bill establishing the commission to study the short and long-term impacts of pending national and regional carbon pricing mechanisms on New Hampshire's residents, agriculture, wildlife, and natural resources-based tourism sector and commercial enterprises.

569
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:19.500
And I ask the prime sponsor of the bill, Representative Oxenham, to introduce the bill, please.

570
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.500
Thank you.

571
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.500
Mr.

572
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:33.500
Chair, before my five minutes opens, I would like a clarification on how this hearing is going to be conducted.

573
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.500
Are we being held to 18 minutes on this matter?

574
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.000
I don't think 18 minutes is realistic.

575
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:54.000
What I will do is at 11 o'clock I will open the public hearing on the next bill, which is HB 410, I believe.

576
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.500
And then we'll recess that hearing immediately.

577
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:04.000
We have five people who have signed up to speak on this bill.

578
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.500
So hopefully we can get through those five speakers in relatively short order.

579
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.500
Thank you and proceed, Representative Oxenam.

580
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.000
And don't forget to unmute.

581
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Thank you.

582
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:29.500
Over the last 12 months of this pandemic, we learned that we may have to deal with catastrophes that come upon us unawares.

583
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:53.500
We also recognize that there is a catastrophe that we are currently involved in and which is looming larger as time goes on and that we must deal with it as we have with the COVID crisis by changing our behavior, by innovating and rising to the challenge.

584
00:49:53.500 --> 00:50:02.000
During the past year, we saw a planet literally on fire from Australia to California to Siberia.

585
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Droughts that produce millions of climate refugees, unprecedented heavy precipitation events and floods with costs and human lives and infrastructure damage in the trillions of dollars.

586
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:27.000
We know we must take action to avoid leaving behind an unlivable planet with an erratic climate that will no longer support human civilization.

587
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Conservative estimates by the world's climate scientists state that to achieve climate stabilization and avoid cataclysmic changes, emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases must be brought down to at least 80 to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

588
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.500
This won't be easy and it won't be cheap, but we have options.

589
00:50:53.500 --> 00:51:00.500
And the best option, according to economists, is putting a price on carbon emissions.

590
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:08.500
Currently, the environmental health and social costs of carbon emissions are not included in carbon prices.

591
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:20.000
These are treated as externalized costs that are borne directly and indirectly by Americans in their impaired health and increased morbidity and mortality.

592
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.500
There's no such thing as a free market when it comes to energy.

593
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:32.000
It's rife with monopolies, regulatory regimes, asymmetric information, and asymmetric power.

594
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:45.500
When it comes to fossil fuels, there are dozens of direct and indirect subsidies, which economists call externalities, buried in the tax code or in plain view.

595
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:51.500
And they all come with costs, tens of billions of dollars annually.

596
00:51:51.500 --> 00:52:00.000
These externalities distort the economic calculus of producers and consumers, be they households, businesses, or government entities.

597
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:07.000
In short, they distort the market, burden society, and the rest of the economy.

598
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.500
Nobody pays the true price of carbon.

599
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:16.000
Conservative estimates put direct subsidies annually at $20 billion a year.

600
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:27.000
For economists, the value of a pricing system lies in its ability to capture all the costs associated with that particular good.

601
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:36.500
Fossil fuel externalities, including social costs, environmental costs, and health costs, are not being borne by those imposing them.

602
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.500
They're being borne by the rest of us.

603
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:50.500
Addressing those externalities could save taxpayers billions of dollars in societal costs while improving health and the quality of life.

604
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:59.500
National and regional carbon pricing systems are being developed as we speak, carbon fee and dividend in particular.

605
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:08.000
It can protect low and middle income citizens from the economic impacts of rising prices and fees.

606
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:22.000
It can deliver dividends directly to every person in the country if it's a national regime or regionally if that is the way that it is being imposed.

607
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Because low and moderate income earners spend less than they receive out of these dividend payments, actually imposing carbon fees spurs spending and leads to direct economic growth.

608
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:43.000
And this has been demonstrated around the world in countries where it's been developed.

609
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Carbon pricing spurs market-driven innovation and market efficiencies, which will reduce harmful pollution and leave a healthier, more stable, and more prosperous nation for future generations.

610
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:04.500
In just 12 years, it is predicted that America's CO2 emissions can be reduced by 40 percent.

611
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.000
No other method has this possible efficacy.

612
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:15.000
So if it's such a great idea, why do we need a study committee?

613
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Carbon pricing is coming.

614
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:27.000
It's the most efficient and the most cost-effective way for us to mitigate the dangers associated with unbridled climate change.

615
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:37.000
In the last three years, all our fellow states in the ISO region have put forward legislation with carbon pricing.

616
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.500
Often, their actions are tied to the actions in neighboring states.

617
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:50.500
ISO New England itself supports carbon pricing and has called on the states to work together.

618
00:54:50.500 --> 00:55:04.500
Nationally, we see a number of moves from the Biden administration, and we've also seen the National Chamber of Commerce in just this last week endorsing carbon pricing.

619
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.000
New Hampshire needs to be prepared for what's coming.

620
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:24.000
We need to be at the table so that our lack of fossil fuel production facilities does not leave us out of the loop when others are reaching their decisions.

621
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:32.000
We need to be proactive in safeguarding the economic interests of New Hampshire businesses and residents.

622
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.500
We need a seat at the table, and to get there, we need to prepare.

623
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.500
Please support this bill.

624
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:43.500
Thank you, Representative Oxenham.

625
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.000
Are there any questions for the representative?

626
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Representative Homola?

627
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Yes, Chair.

628
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Thank you.

629
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
Thank you, Representative Oxenham for providing this information.

630
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.500
I have just one question.

631
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.500
Since the U.S.

632
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:09.500
carbon emissions have come down since 2005 steadily, what would be the impetus for this bill?

633
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:17.000
In the interest of time, I'm not going to reiterate the remarks that I've made.

634
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:24.500
We have a number of other speakers who will be providing information on that point.

635
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:33.000
So I can't give you anything further at this time representative okay representative Somsich thank you Mr.

636
00:56:33.000 --> 00:57:09.500
Chairman and thank you Reverend Oxenham for taking my question do I I understand from my knowledge of how this kind of proposal came about, is it not true or am I correct in assuming that this was actually a bipartisan proposal for carbon pricing and that in fact there is a lot of consensus on both sides of the political spectrum that carbon pricing is the best market mechanism to do it.

637
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.500
Correct.

638
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:20.500
Yes, I believe you're referring to one particular bill that's currently in Congress, which has strong bipartisan buy-in.

639
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:33.500
And as you'll hear from other speakers, economists from both sides, former secretaries and treasurer from Republican administrations and Democratic administrations, it's very strongly bipartisan support.

640
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.500
Thank you very much.

641
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.500
Representative Harrington.

642
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.500
Yes, Mr.

643
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.500
Chairman.

644
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.500
This is actually a question for the chair.

645
00:57:45.500 --> 00:58:02.000
Since this is a commission, and I know we've had discussions on this in the past with study committees and commissions, that there was going to be a push to retain those bills.

646
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:14.000
And I realized that the representative put an awful lot of work into this, and she certainly should have her day to do it.

647
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:34.500
But if we're going to retain the bills and come back again with these next year, wouldn't it be better to address the bill at that time, if that's the intent of where we're heading with these commissions and study committees?

648
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:42.500
Not picking on this one in particular, but just that seems to be a general policy.

649
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.500
Well, you raise a good point, Representative Harrington.

650
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:53.000
If we do anything with this bill, it would be to retain it.

651
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.500
So we'll have plenty of time to discuss the bill in the fall.

652
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:04.500
But if people want to discuss it now, we can.

653
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.000
I won't cut them off.

654
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.500
Let's put it that way.

655
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:13.000
Representative McGee, you're recognized for a question.

656
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Thank you, Mr.

657
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Chair.

658
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.500
My question was actually pertaining to the same thing.

659
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:39.000
I wanted to ask Representative Oxenham, since we're being told that study commissions and committees will be retained for time constraints again, which I feel are self-imposed and not necessarily, but that's an editorial thing.

660
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Can you give us the reason why this particular commission's work should not be delayed because I think that would be a relevant bit of information for us.

661
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
We have two options here today.

662
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:07.500
We can retain the bill as was suggested by the chair as the standard process for dealing with study committees and study commissions.

663
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.000
There's also an option for an ITL.

664
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:22.500
And I must say, after this morning's discussions, I feel that this bill is in threat of not being retained, despite those assurances.

665
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:36.500
So I feel that we need to have the discussion at this time so that people understand, first and foremost, the nature of the threat that we face.

666
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:47.000
Secondly, the fact that there is an option on the table to do this, whether New Hampshire is present or not.

667
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And this commission is all about making it possible for New Hampshire to have a voice and be represented as those discussions go forward.

668
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Thank you.

669
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.500
Next up would be, oh, I see no more hands actually.

670
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:31.000
So I thank you representative oxenham for introducing the bill and i will now call on our next speaker who would be the honorable marge shepherdsson so if she could be elevated from attendee or allowed to speak I'd like to turn the floor over to former representative Shepperson.

671
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.500
Okay, I figured it out.

672
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
Thank you, Mr.

673
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.500
Chairman.

674
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:43.500
And thank you to the members of ST&E for holding this hearing.

675
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:57.500
I urge you to pass HB 394 and establish a commission to study the effects a carbon fee would have on the citizens and businesses of New Hampshire.

676
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:03.500
Polls have shown that 70% of people want action on climate change.

677
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:13.000
As you have heard, a carbon fee and dividend program would address the problem by reducing carbon emissions greatly.

678
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:22.000
This plan has been endorsed by many citizens and groups around the country, most recently by the U.S.

679
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.500
Chamber of Commerce, which now says it supports, quote, durable climate policy and a market-based approach to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the U.S.

680
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.500
economy, unquote.

681
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:44.500
They prefer the market over regulation because it is least cost and it doesn't grow government.

682
01:02:44.500 --> 01:03:01.500
Citizens across New Hampshire are endorsing carbon pricing, as evidenced by the 28 towns that passed a resolution to that effect last year, and the numerous new towns that will consider it this year.

683
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:05.500
I expect the number to more than double.

684
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:11.000
A growing number of faith communities have endorsed it as well.

685
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:24.500
Last year, led by churches in New Hampshire, the United Church of Christ endorsed it at their national synod, and they represent 5,000 churches across the country.

686
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:33.000
They join 130 other faith groups from Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and Quaker backgrounds around the country.

687
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Businesses are also endorsing it more each day.

688
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.500
How do we know what effect carbon pricing would have on our state?

689
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.500
That's what this bill is about.

690
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:53.500
What effect on our businesses, such as tourism, forestry, farming, maple syrup production, skiing?

691
01:03:53.500 --> 01:04:03.500
We know this is coming in the near future, and you as legislators have the opportunity to plan for it.

692
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:15.000
You can help position our state to be ready, ready to create new jobs, ready to benefit from investments in renewable energy infrastructure.

693
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Please help New Hampshire lead the way by figuring out how carbon pricing will affect us and what we can do to take advantage of this new reality.

694
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Thank you.

695
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Thank you, Representative, former Representative Shepperson.

696
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.500
Thanks for being here today.

697
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.000
We appreciate having a chance to interact with you.

698
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.500
Always good to see you.

699
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Are there any questions for Ms.

700
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500
Shepperson?

701
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
How about Representative McGee?

702
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500
I'm sorry Mr.

703
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:58.000
Chair, I believe my hand was up from the prior question.

704
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Oh, no problem.

705
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:13.500
Just a reminder to everybody, once you're finished speaking, if you could lower your hand so that it doesn't appear that you're asking me to speak again.

706
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.500
Okay, looking around the room, I see no hands raised.

707
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.000
I see no hands raised on Zoom.

708
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So we'll move on to our next speaker.

709
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Excuse me, Mr.

710
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Chairman.

711
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
My hand is raised.

712
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Well, it wasn't a second ago when I looked at the screen.

713
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.500
You got me, Representative Sopsich.

714
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500
Go ahead.

715
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
Okay.

716
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

717
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Chairman.

718
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I have a question for Ms.

719
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Shepparton.

720
01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So I understand you're mentioning that these organizations, these religious organizations, are involved in this effort.

721
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.500
Could you tell me what their main motivation is, why they're getting behind this effort?

722
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500
Certainly, Representative.

723
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:26.000
They're behind it because they feel they have a moral obligation to help protect the earth, to conserve the natural world, and that's under great threat from climate change.

724
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:43.500
They also feel it's a social justice issue because communities of color are affected more than others, often living near coal power plants, for example, and having higher rates of asthma and other illnesses, cancer.

725
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:49.500
So we feel it's both a social issue and environmental justice issue.

726
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Thank you very much.

727
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.500
Thank you.

728
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:59.500
Seeing no more hands raised, I will comment on our next speaker.

729
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.500
It's 11 o'clock, Mr.

730
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.500
Chairman.

731
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500
Say again?

732
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500
It's 11 o'clock.

733
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:14.500
Were you going to open the other hearing and then return to this one?

734
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.500
Yes.

735
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.500
Was that the process you suggested?

736
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:34.500
So I'm going to now open the public hearing on HB 410 and immediately recess that hearing and we will return to it as soon as we get the opportunity.

737
01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.500
Thank you.

738
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:47.000
on HB 410 and immediately recess that hearing and we will return to it as soon as we get the opportunity.

739
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.500
But next, we will hear from Mr.

740
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:56.000
Sam Duan, who is a member of the public representing himself.

741
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Mr.

742
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Duan, you are recognized to speak.

743
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Thank you, Mr.

744
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Chairan, you are recognized to speak.

745
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Thank you, Mr.

746
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Chair.

747
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.500
So hi, my name is Sam Duan.

748
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:23.500
I'm an alum from Derryfield School in Manchester and currently a freshman at Boston University studying political science and philosophy.

749
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:32.000
And I speak on behalf of myself today based on my observations in support of HB 394.

750
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.500
So I will start with a little bit of a story about myself.

751
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500
I'm originally from China.

752
01:08:40.500 --> 01:09:05.000
In the first five years or so of my life, I grew up on my grandparents' farm in a rural town in the midst of acres and acres of wheat and rice in the company of chicken sparrows and pigs and other critters whose names I don't even know.

753
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And there was a little creek in front of my grandparents' house.

754
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.500
And every summer I would go with my uncle and cousins and catch little fishes in it.

755
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:24.000
Then I moved to the city, went to school.

756
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.500
My dad started a business when I was 10, et cetera, et cetera.

757
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:37.500
And a few years ago when I visited my grandparents, again, things were different.

758
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:43.000
A new chemical plant opened a few kilometers down the street.

759
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.500
The sky now took on a permanently hazy color.

760
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:59.000
The air had a density to it and it scratched your throat if you stayed outside for more than 10 or so minutes.

761
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.500
Domestic animals were no longer allowed out.

762
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:10.000
The wild animals, if you could see them, now had a sickly look to them.

763
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:20.000
The little creek in front of my grandparents' house was now black with a smell of rubber, petroleum, and naphtha.

764
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.500
The story continued when I moved to New Hampshire.

765
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:37.000
One of the first things I learned to do when I moved here was skiing, obviously, but every year the weather became wackier and wackier.

766
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:53.500
Later snow, less snow, and further up north I have to go to ski and less Massachusetts people on the highways, which was good news for me, but probably not for ski mountains.

767
01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:02.000
And this wackiness peaks on those past years, 60 degrees and raining Christmas in southern New Hampshire.

768
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But on the other side of the coin is my dad and his business.

769
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:20.500
He's involved in wholesale transportation of manufactured goods, which we now know as a whole contributes greatly to the pollution that we face.

770
01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:34.500
So suddenly it seemed that if I'm going to fight for my thorough-esque aspirations, I'd be tossing my bread and butter on the floor and stomping on it.

771
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:39.000
But carbon pricing elegantly reconciles this conflict of interest.

772
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.500
Tweaking the markets against pollution was something I never thought about.

773
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:51.500
For me, the biggest advantage of carbon pricing is that it's simple and predictable.

774
01:11:51.500 --> 01:12:04.000
My dad would know to invest in electric trucks if he clearly understands that diesel trucks will become more expensive in the next five years.

775
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:13.000
An expenditure in the first few years, maybe, but that would keep us afloat for the foreseeable future.

776
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.500
If this can happen to wholesale transportation, it can happen to any business.

777
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:30.000
The most major drawback, I think, of carbon pricing is that it does not directly address pollution in an obvious way.

778
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:43.500
Emphasis on the word obvious, which I think is also why it is not as popular of a policy compared to some other ones in mass media.

779
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:55.500
But that is exactly why we need a study commission to provide a more scientific, less emotional, and more trustworthy understanding of government pricing.

780
01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:10.000
And not far from where I live in Southern New Hampshire, there is a sugar shack and their maple syrup is the hands-down best maple syrup I've ever had.

781
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:19.500
Every morning, we'll have a cup of coffee or tea with exactly one teaspoon of maple syrup in it.

782
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:35.500
And if we do nothing in a decade or two, sugar maple will no longer grow on that latitude and I would have to set my morning tea tax to Canada instead.

783
01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.500
And hence I support HB 394.

784
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.500
Thank you.

785
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.000
Thank you, we appreciate that.

786
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Any questions for Mr.

787
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Duan?

788
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Representative McGee.

789
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Thank you, Mr.

790
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.500
Chair, and thank you, Mr.

791
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500
Dewan, for your testimony.

792
01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:01.500
I'm assuming that would be Ben's sugar shack in southern New Hampshire?

793
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:07.000
No, I'm not going to make any, what do Oh, okay.

794
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
That's fine.

795
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Actually, my question was around, you talked about the elegance of the solution in your testimony.

796
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And I think maybe you want, I'd like to hear you say a little bit more about that.

797
01:14:26.000 --> 01:15:01.500
Because when I got involved with looking at carbon pricing in the last session, what was nice about it was the cash back portion, which is the concept that although the polluters get charged for the pollution they cause so that they're no longer externalizing those costs, the benefits go to the rate payers so that the increasing cost doesn't end up burdening them as we move away from dirtier fuels.

798
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:12.500
So you mentioned the elegance, but I think, I don't know if you really said a lot about that piece of it.

799
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.000
So could you say a little more?

800
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Oh, I actually, I actually like that a lot because like my parents' business, for example, we started out very small, which I think is, you know, a common theme here in New Hampshire.

801
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And I think a dividend would actually benefit smaller businesses better than they would bigger businesses.

802
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Because, you know, if, say, your mom and pop shop, like, are getting, like, this extra income every month, right, they're going to have a much better time.

803
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.500
And with their operations, which I think is awesome.

804
01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.500
Thank you.

805
01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.000
I'll take my hand now.

806
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.500
Representative Somsich is recognized for a question.

807
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500
Thank you.

808
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
Thank you, Mr.

809
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.000
Chairman, and thank you, Mr.

810
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Wang, for testifying.

811
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:30.500
In light of the fact that you have Chinese origin here, as we all know, China is currently the number one emitter of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.

812
01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:38.000
Could you tell me something about what China is doing currently about greenhouse gas emissions?

813
01:16:38.000 --> 01:17:08.000
So I haven't followed up too much recently, but I do know that well China actually has some pilot carbon pricing programs first time first time I've seen you know for a couple months ago when I checked and also I'm sure I'm sure that there are mechanisms we can do to actually make them engage more in such policies.

814
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Okay, thank you.

815
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000
That question was really not relevant to the subject of this bill.

816
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Are there any further questions at this point in time?

817
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Seeing none, we'll move on to our next speaker, who is Mr.

818
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.500
Walter Payne, a member of the public who is representing himself.

819
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.500
Mr.

820
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.000
Payne, you are now allowed to speak.

821
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And please keep your remarks brief and to the point about why we need a study committee on this subject.

822
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Thank you.

823
01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:07.500
Dear House STE Committee, I support HB 394 because climate change will make life in New Hampshire and the rest of the world less wonderful for our children and grandchildren than it was for us.

824
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:23.500
Pricing carbon is the most efficient way to prevent that and knowledge of the likely effects of pricing carbon on New Hampshire can help all of us better plan for the future.

825
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:48.000
A study commissioned by the New England Power Generating Association last year found, in agreement with virtually all economists, that carbon pricing could be the vital tool for reaching the member state's target of reducing carbon emissions to 80 percent by the year 2050 at the lowest possible cost.

826
01:18:48.000 --> 01:19:06.500
It's estimated that an efficient carbon pricing system would save New Hampshire ratepayers somewhere between $10 and $30 million over 10 years when compared with non-market systems to reduce emissions, such as New Hampshire's renewable portfolio standard.

827
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:24.500
In household terms, total annual energy costs in 2035 would be lower with a carbon fee than without, partially because it would incentivize the switch to more efficient electric vehicles and heat pumps for home heating.

828
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:56.500
Performing a wider ranging study under HB 394 on the impact of various forms of carbon pricing specifically on New Hampshire would help our elected representatives push for the policies best for our state, and perhaps more important, allow our residents, businesses, and state local governments to efficiently plan for the future by including a carbon price in their calculations when making energy-intensive investments.

829
01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:11.500
Whether a family replacing a failing furnace, a manufacturer building a new factory, or a utility adding generating capacity, they all benefit from more accurate information about future energy costs.

830
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:26.500
It should be noted that while New Hampshire has no fossil fuel industry, it does have lots of clever engineering firms that will find innovative ways to produce renewable energy.

831
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:35.000
There are a lot of those already with carbon pricing creating greater incentives to switch to renewables.

832
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
There will be more of them.

833
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:47.500
Thank you for consideration and I appreciate you setting this mechanism up for the public to comment on bills.

834
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500
Thank you.

835
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.500
Mr.

836
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.500
Payne.

837
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500
Any questions for Mr.

838
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.500
Payne from members of the committee?

839
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.500
Seeing none, I thank you, Mr.

840
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500
Payne, for your testimony.

841
01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
You're welcome.

842
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:26.000
And remarkably so so it appears that we only have one more speaker left on this bill so i would call if i can find him on the list And I don't see John Gage's name on the list of attendees.

843
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I would call on John Gage to speak.

844
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:41.000
However, I don't see his name on the list of attendees, so I can't click the button that allows him to speak.

845
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.500
So I guess we'll have to forego his testimony.

846
01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:57.000
I know he submitted extensive written testimony on this bill, and I urge all the members of the committee to read that testimony.

847
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:08.500
I know he submitted extensive written testimony on this bill and I urge all the members of the committee to read that testimony.

848
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.000
Representative Oxenham, did you have a question?

849
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:19.500
Yes, I'm concerned because two of the presentations that I knew of, testimony was submitted.

850
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:26.500
I spoke with the individuals last evening and they certainly intended to be here.

851
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:34.500
Is there, do we have any understanding of why we're not seeing them on the Zoom?

852
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:44.500
Well, the list that I have of speakers was generated approximately one half hour before the start of our session.

853
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:55.000
So nobody had signed up to speak as of roughly 930 this morning beyond the people who we've already called on.

854
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Is that your question?

855
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.500
Are you asking if there are other people who signed up to speak?

856
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:17.000
In part, I took notes when I went through as to how many people had sent in testimony through the STE system through the general court website.

857
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And I anticipated hearing from two more speakers.

858
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Excuse me for interrupting.

859
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Excuse me.

860
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.500
I haven't recognized you yet.

861
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:35.500
A lot of people send in written testimony but then do not sign up to speak.

862
01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:41.500
I don't know the reason to that but it happens quite frequently.

863
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:46.500
So I have no idea what the reason might be.

864
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.500
I do see a hand raise.

865
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:56.000
Suzanne Butcher has her hand raised and I will allow her to speak.

866
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.500
So Suzanne Butcher, go ahead.

867
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:06.500
You'll have two minutes to speak and to address any points that haven't already been raised.

868
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.500
There.

869
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.000
Can you hear me now?

870
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Yes.

871
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Okay, good.

872
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Yeah, I wonder.

873
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I know John Gage was planning on being here and probably others.

874
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.500
I'm Suzanne Butcher from Keene, and I'll be brief.

875
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:38.000
I really urge you to support HB 394 to study the impacts of carbon pricing on the people of New Hampshire.

876
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.500
Our country and the world are going to transition to a low carbon economy sooner or later.

877
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:53.500
If we act sooner and smarter, we'll avoid a lot of costs, huge costs.

878
01:24:53.500 --> 01:25:12.500
3,500 economists, including George Shultz and Jim Baker and Janet Yellen, said in the Wall Street Journal that carbon pricing would be, quote, the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that's necessary.

879
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:28.000
Carbon fee and dividend, also known as carbon cashback, would put a price on carbon at the source, not at every gas station, at the mine, the refinery, or the port.

880
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.500
So that's much simpler administratively.

881
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:38.500
And it would distribute the money not to the government, but to citizens directly and equally.

882
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:44.500
It would put money in people's pockets to spend as they choose.

883
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:58.000
The vast majority of people, especially those with lower incomes, would come out ahead, receiving more in carbon cashback than they would spend in increased energy prices.

884
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.500
So carbon cashback is market-based.

885
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.000
It doesn't rely on regulations and subsidies.

886
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
It's revenue neutral.

887
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Revenue neutral.

888
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.500
And it doesn't grow government.

889
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:16.500
It would protect our future by reducing carbon emissions quickly and steadily.

890
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:25.500
It will provide predictability to our businesses and incentivize energy efficiency and clean energy production in New Hampshire.

891
01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.000
Now we buy fossil fuels from out of state.

892
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:40.500
New Hampshire should plan for and prepare for a low-carbon future and identify and support the best ways to get there.

893
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:49.000
Carbon cashback has broad support when people understand it across the political spectrum and across the nation.

894
01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:04.000
When you hear some people or politicians say they fee on carbon won't fly, they're not focusing on the cashback provisions that make it work and make it broadly popular.

895
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:20.500
Because national carbon pricing is likely, our state should pull the stakeholders together and evaluate what the change will mean for New Hampshire and make recommendations on how best to respond to it.

896
01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:27.000
I hope you'll support HB 394 and I'm happy to answer any questions.

897
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Thank you very much.

898
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.500
We do have a couple of questions.

899
01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.000
First up is Representative Crescent.

900
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Thank you, Chair.

901
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:48.500
This is actually more of a point of order related to the previous discussion about attendees that were expected but aren't showing up.

902
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:59.500
At the beginning of the session, the information that you read said that we should be pausing the committee and adjourning later.

903
01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:06.000
If members of the public can't get in, how would we determine that?

904
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.500
Thank you for that question.

905
01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:33.500
We would determine that by them calling the telephone number that I read in the opening statement, which is 271-3600, and discussing their issue with the person who answers the phone, that person would then communicate with us and let us know if there was a problem on our end.

906
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.500
There is.

907
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:43.500
If there's a problem on our end, we would suspend this public hearing and reconvene later.

908
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:51.500
If the problem is with the person with the other end, then the hearing would continue.

909
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500
Mr.

910
01:28:53.500 --> 01:29:02.500
Chair, if I may interject out of turn here, I just received a phone call from John Gage.

911
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:08.500
He says that on his screen, he appears in the attendee list.

912
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.500
He.

913
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500
out of turn here.

914
01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:17.000
I just received a phone call from John Gage.

915
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
He says that on his screen he appears in the attendee list.

916
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
He is trying to get into the meeting.

917
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.500
He was scheduled to speak.

918
01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:34.000
Could you repeat that phone number one more time?

919
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.500
The phone number is 271-3600.

920
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:41.000
I still do not see John Gage on that.

921
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.500
My understanding is he appears as CCL New Hampshire rather than John Gage.

922
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:50.000
I don't see that either.

923
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
That is there.

924
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.500
Yeah, so he's in there.

925
01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.500
I do see a CCL NHRI.

926
01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:29.000
It does have its hand raised, but I wasn't prepared to allow an organization that I wasn't familiar with to to talk so i will i will allow ccl-nh-ri to speak provided that um they can identify themselves as someone on the speaking list such as john gage who is listed on the speaking list as a member of the public representing himself.

927
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Okay, who are allowed to speak?

928
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Hello, Representative Vose.

929
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.500
Thank you so much for connecting me.

930
01:30:37.500 --> 01:31:14.000
I have three different Zoom accounts, and somehow my computer was still logged in as one that i use as the state coordinator of citizens climate lobby a group that i volunteer with i'm sorry that i appeared as that i didn't attend it i actually tried to log out and log back in as myself but apparently that didn't change on your side so i am here representing myself as a Mr.

931
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.500
Gage, you are permitted to speak for two minutes.

932
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:28.500
Please make any new points that we haven't heard about why we need a study committee to study this issue.

933
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.500
Okay.

934
01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:39.000
Do I have the ability to share a screen or would you just prefer me to speak.

935
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.500
Just prefer you to speak.

936
01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:49.500
As was mentioned, economists recommend carbon pricing because it's the least cost method to reduce emissions.

937
01:31:49.500 --> 01:32:10.500
And they recommend a full rebate of all of the money collected from fossil fuel producers back to households on a monthly basis and even shares as the most equitable way to manage the money that's collected and protect household purchasing power.

938
01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:21.000
What we haven't spoken about in this meeting yet is prices and what's going on in the rest of the world.

939
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:46.500
A lot of climate economists have converged on a price of $100 per ton of CO2 by 2030 as the necessary price around the world in order to meet the Paris target commitments that every country in the world had signed up to four years ago and the recommitting, the U.S.

940
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:52.500
is recommitting to, I believe, this month, along with every other country.

941
01:32:52.500 --> 01:33:00.500
So $100 per ton of CO2 would shock our economy if we did it right away.

942
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:04.000
They say we should do it incrementally.

943
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.500
We could start now and raise it by $10 a year and get to the necessary limit.

944
01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:18.500
So there are 46 other countries in the world already pricing carbon.

945
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.500
China was mentioned before.

946
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:33.000
They have several tests with carbon pricing going on, but later this year, they plan on introducing national carbon pricing for several of their sectors.

947
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Once they come into carbon pricing, there will be more than 20% of fossil fuels around the world under some form of carbon price.

948
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.500
Very few of them are close to the $100 a ton.

949
01:33:50.500 --> 01:34:01.500
However, with border carbon adjustments, the EU and Canada will soon begin applying their carbon price on our exports into their borders.

950
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:20.000
This is going to, instead of us charging for our pollution and rebating the money back to households, our major trading partners will be collecting the money for our carbon pollution and using it in their economy.

951
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Of course, this is going to strong arm the U.S.

952
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.500
into matching their carbon price.

953
01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.500
Canada uses carbon fee and dividend.

954
01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.000
They will reach $130 per ton U.S.

955
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
by 2030.

956
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:49.500
The EU is committed to put border carbon adjustments in place by 2023, which is going to, and working with Canada, start charging us their carbon price.

957
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:58.000
And that will also let them increase their carbon price, which is $27 a ton right now.

958
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.500
So we're doing lots of things in our state that aren't very efficient.

959
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:14.000
Even Reggie only puts $5 per ton price on carbon emissions for 20% of our state's fossil fuel use.

960
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:34.000
We need a comprehensive solution, and that's carbon pricing at the source where it comes out of the ground, and we need it to be able to spread around the world because we can't do this alone, and the U.S.

961
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000
is only responsible for 13% of global emissions.

962
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Okay, Mr.

963
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.500
Kahn, I appreciate your testimony.

964
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:50.000
Before I open it up to other folks for questions, I have a question myself.

965
01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:09.500
A recently released study by Jessica Green, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, undertook one of the first comprehensive studies of carbon taxes and their existing carbon taxes and their effectiveness around the country.

966
01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:20.000
And she discovered that of all the carbon tax schemes that are in existence today, they have produced very minimal results.

967
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:33.500
Average annual reductions ranging from zero to 1.5% per annum, whereas the IPCC states that emissions must fall below 45% by 2030 in order to be effective.

968
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:42.000
So the carbon pricing schemes that are in existence today don't seem to be working very well.

969
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Are you confident that the carbon pricing scheme that you've discussed will actually work?

970
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.500
Yes, I am, because it all comes down to the price.

971
01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:01.000
And the average carbon price around the world is about $4 per ton.

972
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.500
It's not a strong price signal to change behavior.

973
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:09.500
Why aren't countries using a strong enough price?

974
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:15.500
Well, the U.S., with the biggest economy, really is the powerhouse here.

975
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:25.000
Other countries can put some price on carbon, but at a certain point, they have to worry about leakage.

976
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:34.500
And that is by raising the cost of their energy, they can leak jobs and businesses to other countries.

977
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:47.000
And when they import goods produced in those countries, they're leaking carbon because of what they're buying that's produced elsewhere that doesn't have a price.

978
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So this is where the dividend really becomes the magic.

979
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Economists have converged.

980
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
As someone else mentioned, there was an economist statement where nearly every leading U.S.

981
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:11.000
economist says, agrees, we should put a steadily increasing price on carbon and rebate all the money back to households.

982
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.500
This protects purchasing power, but it also makes it politically viable.

983
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:31.000
The carbon cashback thing that we did in this state in 2020 showed voters, 70% of towns are in favor of carbon pricing if all the money is returned.

984
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:39.500
They asked our state and federal legislators to implement carbon fee and dividend by voting for it.

985
01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:44.000
And some towns voted 97% in favor of that.

986
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.500
That was Holderness and Plymouth.

987
01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:52.000
Others that missed it just missed it by a couple votes.

988
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:06.500
There's a strong urge among the public to address climate change, and economists say cash back carbon pricing is the most cost effective and equitable way to do it.

989
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:11.500
Canada is a great example of that this does work.

990
01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:23.000
Right now they've only got a price of $30 per ton, which isn't enough to move mountains, but they just increased their ambition.

991
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Instead of stopping at $50 per ton, they're going to go up to $130 a ton because the cashback approach is working for them.

992
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:50.000
So yeah, right now we haven't seen much because the average price is $4 a ton, but there's no other policy that comes close to the power of carbon pricing.

993
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.500
But we have to use it correctly.

994
01:39:53.500 --> 01:40:00.000
You can't look at improperly administered policy and say, see, it doesn't work.

995
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.500
We have to use it in the proper way.

996
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.500
And it will work.

997
01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:11.500
The economists are almost unanimous in their support for this.

998
01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:17.500
We have to listen to the experts because none of us are.

999
01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:28.500
Climate scientists say we have an identified threat with high certainty, and economists say this is the most cost-effective and equitable solution.

1000
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:34.000
But the question here is not whether it's going to happen.

1001
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.500
It is going to happen.

1002
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:41.500
The trend around around the world is to price carbon.

1003
01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:46.500
The question is what should our state do about it?

1004
01:40:46.500 --> 01:41:00.500
And you talk a lot about how we can become more energy efficient and what's the best way to do that and subsidize clean energy in this committee.

1005
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:08.500
Carbon pricing will make states more competitive that have lower carbon footprints per their economic strength.

1006
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:27.500
And so by becoming more energy efficient and by switching off of fossil fuels, we can become more competitive and we can either wait until everybody else has done it or we can get ahead of the game.

1007
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.500
Okay.

1008
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.500
Yeah.

1009
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:36.000
Representative Pimentel, do you have a question for Mr.

1010
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Gage?

1011
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Thank you, Mr.

1012
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Chairman.

1013
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
First of all, I want to apologize for interrupting earlier.

1014
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.500
I was merely trying to inform you that Mr.

1015
01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:55.500
Gage was in the participant list under CCLNH.

1016
01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.500
But I do apologize for interrupting.

1017
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.500
Thank you, Mr.

1018
01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.500
Chairman.

1019
01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.500
Mr.

1020
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:23.500
Gage, could you explain to me what, I mean, I assume a lot of people think that why don't we just wait for the federal level to go ahead and implement some kind of a carbon cash back?

1021
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:33.500
But I understand most of the other New England states are now in the process of implementing something like this.

1022
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:41.500
And what's going to happen if other states in New England do it and we don't?

1023
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.000
Well, that's a good question.

1024
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.500
So there's lots of ways to reduce your state's carbon footprint.

1025
01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:54.500
Carbon pricing is the most cost-effective way to do it.

1026
01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.000
You know, Massachusetts has lots of programs.

1027
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.500
Some of them are quite expensive, but they are reducing their carbon footprint.

1028
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:20.500
What that means when there's a national price and a global price on carbon emissions is Massachusetts will become naturally more competitive than we are because their whole economy produces less carbon.

1029
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:27.500
They will be paying less for their carbon emissions because they will have less.

1030
01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:33.500
So the question is, how do we want to deal with this?

1031
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:39.500
And we can just wait until the federal price happens to us.

1032
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:51.500
And if we have a relatively high carbon footprint, our businesses and our towns are gonna be paying higher prices due to that fee.

1033
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:56.000
Now the citizens will be getting that money back.

1034
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:14.500
But, you know, if we're much higher than other states and everybody across the country is getting the same money back, our higher prices are going to be hurting us and other states will be more competitive.

1035
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:30.000
So, you know, really the question is, how can you use the insights that the world will have a price of $100 per ton on carbon by 2030 to your advantage?

1036
01:44:30.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You know, I believe that you want to become more energy efficient and you want to begin the transition of your costly energy infrastructure that stays in place for decades, transitioning it to clean energy solutions now so that you don't, you know, if you're a homeowner and you get a report from our state that says, you know, we know it's cheaper to buy an oil furnace right now.

1037
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:31.500
However, we believe that it's a better choice to make a heat pump decision because this will be heating your home for 20 30 years, and it might be cheaper for the next five years, but then it's going to be more expensive for the next 25 years if you make that choice.

1038
01:45:31.500 --> 01:46:20.000
You know, people just don't see this coming, and they're looking for our state leaders to kind of advise them, how can we spend the least amount on energy what are the good decisions for us to make sticking our heads in the thank you for that answer mr gage next up is representative mcgee thank you mr chairman and thank you mr gage for your testimony um i also would like to thank you for the context that you've brought to the hearing because we're not talking today about whether we should pass climate change legislation.

1039
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:35.500
We're talking about whether we should study the fact that we may not have all the answers as to how to interpret this for the state and for its energy economy.

1040
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:52.000
And I think that's what, for me, raises the question of delaying, since we're retaining bills that are committees and commissions as a matter of course this term, what the delay would do.

1041
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.500
And so my question is around, I'll just say one other thing too.

1042
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:10.000
Earlier it was mentioned that New Hampshire has lowered its carbon emissions in recent years, and that's true in the electric generation sector.

1043
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.500
We have brought our emissions down over recent years.

1044
01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:27.000
We just had a report from New Hampshire DES saying that that will plateau this year, so we're not actually going to continue going down.

1045
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.500
The major sector that we haven't addressed is transmission.

1046
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:42.000
And I just saw an article saying that General Motors has announced that it will no longer be making combustible vehicles.

1047
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.500
It will be moving to all electrics by 2035.

1048
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:59.500
So it just speaks to what is moving on around us that we actually have to figure out what are the right moves for New Hampshire.

1049
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:06.000
So could you just say something about the timing of all of this?

1050
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Because even if we have a study commission, we really won't have any action on that for another year or two years.

1051
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Yes.

1052
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:37.500
Well, you know, I believe for our state's benefit, had the state gone ahead with carbon fee and dividend at the state level last year, we would be in a really much better position to see this.

1053
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:47.000
The fee starts low and increases gradually, but it sends a strong signal about what the future looks like.

1054
01:48:47.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And one of the things that's important is businesses and others who make energy decisions, they don't care as much about the short-term fluctuations as the long-term prospects.

1055
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.500
And so we are simply missing opportunity by waiting.

1056
01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:19.000
Had we figured out how to be really energy efficient by now, you know, this stuff is more expensive the less time you have to do it.

1057
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:46.500
So if we start earlier, then all the homes that need new furnaces and people that are buying cars would be making different choices if they had full information, if they had a complete information of what's going on in the market and could see a carbon price of $100 per ton in 10 years.

1058
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:53.000
So if we delay a year or two, this is just missing opportunity.

1059
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
We're increasing our costs.

1060
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.500
We're going to be spending more to make conversions.

1061
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:14.000
We're going to have more stranded costs as the equipment that we decide to buy now because of current market pricing becomes obsolete when there is a carbon price.

1062
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I just feel like the science and the economics is so clear and the trends of carbon pricing around the world are so clear.

1063
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:43.000
And the IPCC statement that carbon pricing is a necessary factor of getting emissions down globally as needed to meet the targets that every country in the world has agreed we need to do.

1064
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Okay, thank you, Mr.

1065
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Gage.

1066
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Next up is Representative John Mann.

1067
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Yes, thank you, Mr.

1068
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Gage.

1069
01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:06.500
I was really impressed with your comment about we don't want to be last in New England about understanding the effects of the climate tax.

1070
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.500
We have an analogous situation in electric costs.

1071
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:16.500
We've been outstripped by Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont in energy efficiency work.

1072
01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:24.000
And the regional grid assigns costs of transmission according to how much electricity you use.

1073
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:38.500
And I found that our transmission since 2016 to 2020, my first 650 kilowatt hour customer, his electric bill, the transmission part only has gone up $6 a month.

1074
01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:48.500
And that's just an example of what we can get stuck with if we wanna be last in the queue.

1075
01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.500
Thank you.

1076
01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:53.000
Okay, thank you, Representative Mann.

1077
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I didn't really hear a question there, so...

1078
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Oh, that's, yeah, would you believe?

1079
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.500
Next up is Representative Parshall.

1080
01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:05.000
Don't forget to unmute, Representative.

1081
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
My best, sir.

1082
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Thank you.

1083
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:22.500
So even setting aside the threats of inaction, the benefits of moving forward with a study group that seems imperative to me, only encouraging our economic stimulus.

1084
01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:34.500
And my question is, is there a way to calculate the lost costs for every day that we delay enacting this kind of legislation?

1085
01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:43.000
Well, the external costs of using fossil fuels, there's a new branch of science called attribution science.

1086
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:50.500
They're calculating how much damage the impacts of global warming are having on the U.S.

1087
01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:58.500
It used to be counted in the tens of billions of dollars a couple decades ago.

1088
01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:02.000
Last year, it was about $200 billion.

1089
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:08.000
So the costs of inaction at the federal level are rapidly increasing.

1090
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:15.500
And there are tipping points that are just simply irrecoverable problems, species lost, people dying.

1091
01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:31.000
You can melt enough ice in the polar regions to absorb more of the sun's energy instead of reflecting it back to space that then you get additional positive feedback warming.

1092
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:39.500
And then you have to address that problem in addition to the problems caused by our pollution.

1093
01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.000
So every year is getting more expensive.

1094
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
You know, but the...

1095
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
the problems caused by our pollution.

1096
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.500
So every year is getting more expensive.

1097
01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:55.000
But New Hampshire can't solve climate change.

1098
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:07.000
What we could do is show the country and the world that we can pick a sensible, practical, bipartisan approach to addressing the pollution.

1099
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:21.500
The state could recommend to Congress that we would like them to do carbon fee and dividend, but even for our own competitiveness, we should prepare for carbon pricing.

1100
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:48.000
We should use this bill to get all the stakeholders together and make it out apparent that energy efficiency is helpful now, but when carbon pricing kicks in and energy becomes more expensive temporarily, but it will be for a decade or two, that energy efficiency is going to pay back even more.

1101
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Okay, thank you, Mr.

1102
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Gage.

1103
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.500
I appreciate your comments, your extensive comments.

1104
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:59.500
I know you have submitted extensive written testimony.

1105
01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:05.000
I urge every member of the committee to read that testimony.

1106
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Unfortunately, we're going to have to move on.

1107
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.500
And the reason is simple.

1108
01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:19.000
We started another public hearing on HB 410 at 11 o'clock and then recessed it.

1109
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:31.500
We now have 22 minutes to complete the public hearing on that bill and we have at least three people who would like to speak.

1110
01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:35.500
So we're going to have to move on.

1111
01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500
Mr.

1112
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:48.000
Chair, couldn't we take some time out of our lunch break rather than curtail the proper deliberation on the next bill?

1113
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I hardly think that it's fair to deprive members of a break in the middle of the day.

1114
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.500
So just a shorter break.

1115
01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:06.500
Could we have a show of hands as to whether people would prefer to?

1116
01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:20.500
We have no need to continue to debate this bill since at best it will be retained and we'll have plenty of time to talk about it later.

1117
01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:32.000
But it's a discourtesy to the people who are waiting to testify on HB 410 to delay discussion of that bill any longer.

1118
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Excuse me, Mr.

1119
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Chair, I think you misunderstood me.

1120
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I'm trying to make sure 410 gets its full hour of a hearing by curtailing our lunch period.

1121
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:52.500
I certainly agree that we should suspend any more consideration of my bill.

1122
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.500
Okay.

1123
01:56:54.500 --> 01:57:02.000
It's possible that we can go longer than the 12 o'clock hour for this bill.

1124
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:55.500
Depends on public testimony and the questions go so with that we will uh right before closing the hearing on hb 394 i'll report that 117 people signed up to support this bill one signed up to oppose it and with that we close the hearing on HB 394 and resume the hearing on hb 410 and i call on the prime sponsor of the bill hb 410 to give us a brief introduction to the bill thank you mr chairman i'm representative burna prime sponsor we filed this bill a year ago um as a result of the deregulation of the utilities selling off their generation.

1125
01:57:55.500 --> 01:58:04.500
The companies that purchased them, we worked on a bill two sessions ago, I should back up quick.

1126
01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:17.000
It was a possible 700 that took about a year and a half, two years to complete, with a lot of help from both sides.

1127
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.500
And we came up with a near perfect bill.

1128
01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:33.000
The problem that was missing was the utilities not reporting the inventory or what they have at their plans or their generation site.

1129
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.500
So none of the generation.

1130
01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:40.500
And the new owners of the plans have not filed.

1131
01:58:40.500 --> 01:59:39.500
These plates have all been sold since 2017 2017 so there's been a lot of lost revenue it was requested by about 15 towns i have someone who's going to speak on that briefly so myself and representative of brahmi worked on this bill last winter extensively we spent a month working meeting with utilities and property owners and we found the problem and we found the best way going forward so we don't step on anything that was done in the hard work when 700 was worked on that we put a study committee together and i'll leave it at that okay thank you representative merner are there any questions for representative thomas thank you, Representative Murner.

1132
01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:43.000
Are there any questions for Representative Murner?

1133
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Representative Thomas.

1134
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Thank you, Mr.

1135
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.500
Chair, for taking my question.

1136
01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:52.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1137
01:59:52.500 --> 02:00:51.500
I know you just mentioned the reason why, but could you go into just a briefly more of the reasons why you think we need to have a study committee versus what all of you said you did over the summer, why did you come up with an actionable bill well we felt we needed a little more work excuse me excuse me mr chairman we cannot hear what representative thomas just said would you please repeat your question representative thomas i'm wondering i'm wondering i want to second that it's very difficult i don't know what the use of the microphone is or what, but it's it's very difficult to understand what's being said on that audio.

1138
02:00:51.500 --> 02:01:01.500
I have a mic to my left and I have a mic in front of me, so I'll try again.

1139
02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:30.500
Representative Murder, I know that you explained briefly why you thought we needed a study committee, but with all the work that you did over the summer, working with Representative Abrami, could you go into just a little more detail as to why you still think we need a study committee versus coming up with an actionable bill?

1140
02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:34.000
We didn't actually work over the summer.

1141
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
It worked.

1142
02:01:36.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Then we brought it back to the committee as a study bill going forward last year, and it died in the Senate cobit um we did feel that you know we needed more work on it obviously uh representative obrami worked really hard on on the equalization bills that utility utilization which mike i think it was 2017 in one month we marked down i think we had 13 hours of testimony on that retained bill.

1143
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:24.000
So we didn't want to undo all the hard work that we all put into that bill at the time.

1144
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:33.500
I attended all those meetings and we didn't want to step on any toes and make sure everything worked.

1145
02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:39.500
So that was the trevice of going forward with the Senate bill.

1146
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.500
Okay, thank you.

1147
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.500
That's good.

1148
02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:46.500
Representative Somsich, you have a question?

1149
02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:48.500
Thank you.

1150
02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.500
That's good.

1151
02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:53.500
Representative Somsich, you have a question?

1152
02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:55.500
Yes.

1153
02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.500
Thank you, Mr.

1154
02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:00.000
Chairman, and thank you, Mr.

1155
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Representative Murner.

1156
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:18.500
Is it your testimony today or your intention that you'd like us to move ahead with an ITL on this study, even with the sword of Damocles hanging over it to retain it?

1157
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:22.000
I think I got what you said.

1158
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I mean, I think we're looking at retaining it because it is a study committee bill to retain it for right now.

1159
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.500
That's what I'm looking for.

1160
02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:37.500
Okay, thank you.

1161
02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:39.500
Thank you.

1162
02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:42.500
Any other questions for Representative Murdur?

1163
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:58.500
Seeing none, I will call on the next speaker, who is George San Susi, a member of the public who is representing approximately 80 communities within New Hampshire as their utility appraiser.

1164
02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.500
So, Mr.

1165
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:03.500
Sansouci, you are permitted to talk.

1166
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.500
Go ahead, Mr.

1167
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.500
Sandsusi.

1168
02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.500
San Suzy?

1169
02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:18.000
The only San Suzy I have in my attendee list is actually listed as Austin San Suzy.

1170
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.500
I assume George San Suzy is using that account.

1171
02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.500
Is that correct?

1172
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:29.000
And if so, go ahead, you're ready to speak.

1173
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Okay, Mr.

1174
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Sansusi appears to have stepped away.

1175
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:48.500
So we'll move to our next speaker, who is Shirelle Lucas, also a member of the public, but also representing 80 communities within the state as their utility appraiser.

1176
02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:55.000
Looking at the list of attendees, I don't see a Sherelle Lucas listed.

1177
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Mr.

1178
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Chairman?

1179
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Yes.

1180
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Mr.

1181
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Chairman, I'm George Sansouci, to speak, and Sherelle Lucas set it up.

1182
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000
She is one of my employees.

1183
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
We're all one person.

1184
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I see.

1185
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Okay.

1186
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.500
Well, I recognized you to speak a moment ago.

1187
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:25.000
You do have the floor.

1188
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Thank you, Mr.

1189
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Chairman.

1190
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:35.500
House Bill 400 has been introduced to you to solve a bipartisan problem.

1191
02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:45.500
I provided a cover letter and two pages of bullet points that outline the problem that needs to be rectified.

1192
02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:51.000
This bill was introduced last year and got COVID-ed to death.

1193
02:05:51.000 --> 02:06:00.000
so it has been reintroduced this year because this problem is very real and has not gone away.

1194
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:07.000
When the legislature enacted House Bill 700, they corrected half of this reporting problem.

1195
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.500
The problem is very simple.

1196
02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:17.500
The regulated and unregulated public utilities and generation companies, including hydroelectric companies, I really like that.

1197
02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:20.000
The problem is very simple.

1198
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:40.000
The regulated and unregulated public utilities and generation companies, including hydroelectric companies, are refusing and have refused to report any information to the towns and cities for the purpose of the towns and cities valuing the property for their taxes.

1199
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:51.000
The argument has been that they are not legally responsible or required to report to the towns and cities, so they don't.

1200
02:06:51.000 --> 02:07:10.000
What is important to note is that it affects a tremendous number of communities in the state, and we have provided you with the list of communities and the number of utilities that have a history of non-reporting.

1201
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:24.500
Some of the, this is not a public service issue because they do report Eversource, but that doesn't mean if they were sold that they would continue to report.

1202
02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:46.500
When Granite State Electric was sold by New England Power Company, by New England Electric Systems to National Grid, they stopped reporting any further information to the towns and cities for a period of 10 to 12 years until House Bill 700 was enacted.

1203
02:07:46.500 --> 02:08:06.500
The purpose of this bill is to require the utilities to report the relatively simple but necessary levels of information to the towns and cities on an annual basis so the towns and cities can accurately prepare their assessment valuations.

1204
02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:15.000
The utilities are very large taxpayers, as you would know, because of the extent of their infrastructure.

1205
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:22.500
New England Power Company and National Grid are the largest problem children in the state.

1206
02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:34.500
New England Power Company owns a number of transmission lines that they do not report that drain the hydroelectric plants on the Connecticut River.

1207
02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:46.500
They own half of the Merrimack Valley transmission system that was just finished, and they're not reporting to Pelham and Hudson as an example.

1208
02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:54.500
They also are the lead participant that manages the Hydro-Quebec Phase 1 and Phase 2 lines.

1209
02:08:54.500 --> 02:09:09.000
These are the big DC lines from Canada that go from Littleton, New Hampshire, all the way through Hudson and into Massachusetts to provide Hydro-Quebec electricity to New England.

1210
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.500
They have not reported those lines in a very long time.

1211
02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:21.500
When they do appeal, it is only through the courts that we get reporting.

1212
02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:31.000
Hydro-Quebec phase one is from Littleton to Monroe, and it has the major substation that's not reported in Monroe.

1213
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:40.500
That was the first phase that was built, and phase two was Monroe, New Hampshire, to Hudson Town Line.

1214
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:48.500
That line is actually bigger than Northern Pass that was being promoted and is not reported.

1215
02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:56.500
When public service sold its power plants to Central River, Central River bought the hydroelectric plants.

1216
02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:00.500
There are eight of them in the state.

1217
02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:04.500
They have never reported since the hydroelectric plants.

1218
02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:26.000
That is very important because in hydroelectric plants, you do need at least energy and operating income and expenses with which to consider value under the uniform standards of appraisal practice and the state of New Hampshire's appraisal standard boards and the DRA.

1219
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:40.500
They They also, when they sold the fossil plants, Schiller, Newington, Bow, and the Peking Turbans in Northumberland and White Lake in Tamworth, that company has also not reported.

1220
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:58.000
We do have spotty sometimes and sometimes on, sometimes off reporting of the large diameter gas transmission lines by Tennessee Gas, by Maritimes and Northeast coming down from Maine, and by Portland Natural Gas Transmission.

1221
02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:12.000
By and large, though, we do get some reporting from those utilities, but our goal is to codify that so everybody knows what it is that is expected.

1222
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So that is the purpose of this bill.

1223
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:24.500
I would strongly urge that you look at the list of companies and the types of companies.

1224
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:29.500
They are your major taxpayers in the state Thank you.

1225
02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:38.000
I would strongly urge that you look at the list of companies and the types of companies.

1226
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:45.000
They are your major taxpayers in the state, in your communities, your constituent communities.

1227
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:52.500
And this is something that we have needed now for about 10 to 15 years.

1228
02:11:52.500 --> 02:12:01.500
And I would ask your consideration in representing approximately 60 to 70 of these communities on your behalf.

1229
02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:06.500
With that, I'll answer any questions if you have any.

1230
02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:08.500
Thank you, Mr.

1231
02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:10.500
Sands.

1232
02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:20.000
Before I open it up to questions, can I ask you if anyone else from your office be testified?

1233
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
What say?

1234
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Before I open it up to questions, can I ask you if anyone else from your office will be testifying?

1235
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
What say?

1236
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Before I open it up to questions, can I ask you if anyone else from your office will be testifying?

1237
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.500
No, I'm doing the testimony for everybody.

1238
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:49.500
Okay, great.

1239
02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:53.500
And I recognize Representative Thomas for a question.

1240
02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:55.500
Thank you, Mr.

1241
02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.500
Schieder.

1242
02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.500
Thank you, Mr.

1243
02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:02.000
Sansouci, for taking my question.

1244
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I really have just a very neutral question.

1245
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I call this bill 700 and I recall the extensive economy took.

1246
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:24.500
I think it was a two year period where they had study committees that went over that that resulted in in what we have now.

1247
02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:26.500
Can you tell me?

1248
02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:31.500
I'm sure you were part of that at one time.

1249
02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:42.500
Can you tell me with all the extensive committee that work they did back then that was well over a year long?

1250
02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:46.500
Why wasn't this issue addressed at that time?

1251
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:58.500
Or if it was, what was the result of not covering it because you're saying it didn't cover but half of what was needed.

1252
02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:01.500
So can you elaborate on that?

1253
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.500
Yes, I can.

1254
02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.000
And that's an excellent question.

1255
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:20.000
The House Bill 700 was to, the purpose of House Bill 700 was to address the distribution utilities that are regulated by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission.

1256
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000
They are the retail distribution utilities.

1257
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:31.500
These utilities were never included in that debate on how to value the New Hampshire regulated communities.

1258
02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:43.500
These are all companies and property which is regulated at the federal level by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and not the state level.

1259
02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:58.500
The only level of regulation at the state level is the siting of these facilities, but their rates and their actions and their activity is regulated at the federal level.

1260
02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:26.500
And the decision that the legislature legislators made was the complexities of federal legislation, federal regulation was so different than the complexities of local regulation for House Bill 700, that they did not want to mix the two because it would have essentially just would not have worked because it was just two completely different situations.

1261
02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:40.500
That is the reason why they were taken out of the consideration for House Bill 700 and cast aside for a later legislation, which was introduced last year.

1262
02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:58.000
And that's what this legislation is, to deal with them differently, because they are different in how they report and what they report, and would have been contradictory in some instances to House Bill 700.

1263
02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.500
So that's the reason, sir.

1264
02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:02.500
Very good.

1265
02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:04.500
Thank you.

1266
02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:06.500
I appreciate it.

1267
02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:08.500
My pleasure.

1268
02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:10.500
Okay.

1269
02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:12.500
Next question, Representative Oxenham.

1270
02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:14.500
Yes.

1271
02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:20.000
I'm also puzzled why we're being asked to study this again.

1272
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
It seems like there's a clear solution available.

1273
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:36.500
Is it possible for an amendment to be brought that takes us away from being a study committee, which is then going to be retained?

1274
02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:43.000
I understand this bill needs to go to a second committee for consideration.

1275
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Is there a way forward that we can get to a solution without just making this thing hang fire for endless periods.

1276
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.500
Question for the chair, actually.

1277
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:58.500
That's not to me.

1278
02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.500
Mr.

1279
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:02.500
Chair, I'm sorry.

1280
02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:13.500
I didn't say at the outset that my question was to you rather than to the questioner, the speaker of the moment.

1281
02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:33.500
It's about this being a study committee, whether or not we could, it seems like there's a solution available here that could be put into an amendment and we wouldn't have to have yet another study committee retained, more delay.

1282
02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:35.500
I heard your question.

1283
02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:37.500
Thank you for it.

1284
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.000
I prefer the answer to Representative Murner.

1285
02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.500
Yes, in discussion, I discussed this when I went to file a bill.

1286
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:53.000
I discussed it with Representative Browning and the parties and Mr.

1287
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Sandsusi.

1288
02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And we felt everything that had gone on the last three years which was just explained to representative thomas that we go forward with a study committee right now okay uh we have any additional questions seeing none and seeing that we have no further speakers signed up to speak on this uh on this issue on this question i guess uh we can bring this public hearing to a close as well and remarkably we've done so on time.

1289
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:45.000
The blue sheet says that nine people signed up to support this bill, zero people signed up to oppose it.

1290
02:18:45.000 --> 02:19:01.000
And with that, notable people who signed up to support it were Kenneth Mertz, who's a spokesman in New Hamman in New Hampshire, Senator Aaron Hattie, Timothy Egan, and Joseph De Palma.

1291
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Those were the elected officials who signed up to support this bill.

1292
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.500
So with that, I'll close the public hearing on HB 410.

1293
02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:18.500
And we will, between 12 and 1 o'clock, take a lunch break.

1294
02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:24.000
And we will return at 1 o'clock to hear HB 543.

1295
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Thank you this morning.

1296
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
It was very productive.

1297
02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.500
And I thank you all.

1298
02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:36.500
We'll see you at one o'clock She wants a very deep guest.

1299
02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:38.500
Can you hear us?

1300
02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.500
You?

1301
02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:48.000
Well, I'm enjoying you, but I'm not sure I'm going to speak with the school.

1302
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
E aí Obrigado.

1303
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Thank you.

1304
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Thank you.

1305
02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Thank you.

1306
02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Thank you.

1307
02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Thank you.

1308
02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Thank you.

1309
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Thank you.

1310
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Thank you.

1311
02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Thank you.

1312
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Thank you.

1313
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Thank you.

1314
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Thank you.

1315
02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Thank you.

1316
02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Thank you.

1317
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Thank you.

1318
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Thank you.

1319
02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Thank you.

1320
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Thank you.

1321
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Thank you.

1322
02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Thank you.

1323
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Thank you.

1324
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Thank you.

1325
02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Thank you.

1326
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Thank you.

1327
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Thank you.

1328
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Thank you.

1329
02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Thank you.

1330
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Thank you.

1331
02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Thank you.

1332
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Thank you.

1333
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Thank you.

1334
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Thank you.

1335
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Thank you.

1336
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Thank you.

1337
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Thank you.

1338
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Thank you.

1339
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Thank you.

1340
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Thank you.

1341
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Thank you.

1342
02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Thank you.

1343
02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Thank you.

1344
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Thank you.

1345
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Thank you.

1346
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Thank you.

1347
02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Thank you.

1348
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Thank you.

1349
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Thank you.

1350
02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Thank you.

1351
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Thank you.

1352
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Thank you.

1353
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Thank you.

1354
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Thank you.

1355
02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Thank you.

1356
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Thank you.

1357
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Thank you.

1358
02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Thank you.

1359
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Thank you.

1360
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Thank you.

1361
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Thank you.

1362
02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Thank you.

1363
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:56.000
If you're ready to begin, the room just needs to be unmuted.

1364
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.500
From the station up front.

1365
02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:00.500
We are unmuted.

1366
02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:02.500
Okay, we are unmuted.

1367
02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:04.500
Is that correct?

1368
02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:07.500
Yep, you are good to go.

1369
02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.500
Okay, thank you.

1370
02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:11.500
All right, everyone.

1371
02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:14.500
Hope you had a good lunch.

1372
02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:21.000
Welcome back to the afternoon session for the Science, Technology, and Energy Committee.

1373
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:30.000
We have four bills to deal with this afternoon, and the very first one is House Bill 543.

1374
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.500
So I will open the public hearing on House Bill 543.

1375
02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:44.000
that seeks to establish a commission to study nuclear power and nuclear reactor technology in New Hampshire.

1376
02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.500
And the prime sponsor of said bill is Representative Keith Ammon.

1377
02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:56.000
And, Representative Ammon, you are allowed to speak and the floor is yours.

1378
02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Great.

1379
02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Thank you, Mr.

1380
02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Chair.

1381
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
And I'm going to assume that you can hear me.

1382
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Yes.

1383
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Yes.

1384
02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Yes.

1385
02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
We hear you.

1386
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.500
That's every Zoom call has to start with that.

1387
02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:24.500
Thank you for allowing me to introduce House Bill 543.

1388
02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:38.000
The bill seeks to establish a commission to study nuclear power and nuclear reactor technology in New Hampshire, and I thank the committee members for their time.

1389
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Some of you may know I served on science, technology, and energy in 2017 to 18, so I got to be familiar with many of the issues that come before the committee.

1390
02:23:54.000 --> 02:24:05.000
During that time, we took a field trip to the sea coast, or to the nuclear power plant on the sea coast.

1391
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.500
And that was very enlightening.

1392
02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:17.500
One thing that caught my eye was what's called the second pad site, which is now a dilapidated concrete structure.

1393
02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:25.500
So it's a location where a nuclear power plant could have been built, was not built.

1394
02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:37.500
As you may be aware, nuclear technology, and I'm not an expert, but I am an enthusiast, has been advancing the last few decades.

1395
02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:52.500
And there's something called Generation 4 nuclear technology, which purports to be safer, more compact, and something that could be the future of energy production, could contribute to energy production.

1396
02:24:52.500 --> 02:25:06.500
So the Senate has telegraphed that they're going to be putting the kibosh on study bills this year because of the expedited legislative process due to the pandemic.

1397
02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:13.500
So I'm asking the committee if you would please retain this bill for 2022.

1398
02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:25.500
I spoke with ranking member Somsich about the bill, and there may be some improvements to make it bipartisan, to make it more bipartisan.

1399
02:25:25.500 --> 02:25:30.000
One of them is the structure of the committee.

1400
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Representative Somsich pointed out that it does favor Republicans and I'm open to making the selection a little more bipartisan.

1401
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And then also the duties of the commission are quite extensive in the bill.

1402
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I think they could probably be narrowed down.

1403
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.500
Section B is probably the most interesting.

1404
02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:02.000
Section 3B, it talks about the Generation for International Forum, which was established in 2001.

1405
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And they have been, it's an international group.

1406
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000
They have been studying different Generation 4 designs.

1407
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000
A lot of them have to do with higher temperatures.

1408
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:50.500
So they use things like molten salt or molten lead to get higher temperatures to be able to generate more electricity and they've they've narrowed things down to uh narrowed the designs down to the six listed in the bill but that's a good resource if and when this study commission goes forward um there's a chinese proverb it says the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.

1409
02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:53.500
The second best time is now.

1410
02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:56.000
You've probably heard that before.

1411
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000
And so this bill is forward-looking.

1412
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:10.000
If we're going to be serious about eliminating carbon from our economy, nuclear power, I believe, should be part of the discussion.

1413
02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:20.500
And the Generation 4 International Forum says that some of these designs may be commercially deployed within the next 10 years.

1414
02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:35.000
So I think beginning next year, 2022, if we start getting serious about investigating this technology and making New Hampshire a place where that's welcoming to this new technology.

1415
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000
We can transition away from energy sources that produce carbon.

1416
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:51.500
So with that, I'd like to repeat that I'd like the committee to retain this bill, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

1417
02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:53.500
Thank you, Representative.

1418
02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:57.500
The chair recognizes Representative Harrington for a question.

1419
02:27:57.500 --> 02:27:59.500
Yeah, thank you, Mr.

1420
02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:04.000
Chairman, and thank you for taking my question, Representative.

1421
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:13.500
I'm looking at this, and I'm just trying to figure out what it is this commission hopes to accomplish.

1422
02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:29.500
Given that nuclear power is 100% regulated by the NRC through the federal government, the state has very little to do with licensing or anything somewhat to do with developing emergency planning.

1423
02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:37.000
And there is all sorts of stuff going along across the world on nuclear power.

1424
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.500
There's SMRs, which are small modular reactors.

1425
02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:43.500
You mentioned molten salt, high temperature.

1426
02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:48.000
There's a bunch of new potential technologies out there.

1427
02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:54.000
But I'm just not sure what is this commission going to accomplish?

1428
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Because you're still talking probably billions of dollars.

1429
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:11.500
And I'm just not sure how this is going to produce anything that's going to make somebody more interested in building nuclear power plants in New Hampshire.

1430
02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:13.500
Well, you're absolutely correct.

1431
02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:20.000
It's a lot to do with federal regulations where new plants are sited.

1432
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:29.500
One of the duties of the commission would be to look for partnerships with federal agencies, including the U.S.

1433
02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:31.500
Nuclear Reaction Commission.

1434
02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:36.000
It's a long shot, but nobody's talking about it.

1435
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:43.500
So how do we make it, and I see people laughing in the background there.

1436
02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:46.500
How do we make this possible?

1437
02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:56.000
Because, you know, it should be part of our future to have nuclear power, electricity generated by nuclear power.

1438
02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.000
It has a lot of promises.

1439
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.500
Thank you for that question and response.

1440
02:30:02.500 --> 02:30:04.500
Representative Thomas.

1441
02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:06.500
Thank you, Mr.

1442
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.500
Chair.

1443
02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:11.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1444
02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:46.500
I agree that some work could be done on the contents of this bill but are you suggesting that in the very short future that new types of nuclear power reactors which produce zero emissions directly versus over a slow period of time is possible and that this commission would be the studying ways for both public relations and technology wise that it could be done here in New Hampshire.

1445
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:50.000
Is that the intent of this commission?

1446
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Yeah, that's correct.

1447
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.500
I believe this would be the first step in starting a longer conversation.

1448
02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:03.500
And that conversation, to my knowledge, isn't happening right now.

1449
02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:15.000
So it is a forward-looking bill and to attract attention and expertise to our state with a very promising way to produce electricity.

1450
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.500
Does that answer your question?

1451
02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:19.500
Follow up.

1452
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:21.500
Follow up.

1453
02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:23.500
Thank you.

1454
02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:39.000
Yes, and I would agree that if this were to be retained, you would be willing to work on putting some different words in here and, you know, tidying it up.

1455
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:50.000
So it, you know, based on our conversation today and what work may happen before this gets snacked upon next year, correct?

1456
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Absolutely.

1457
02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:02.000
I'm totally willing to pitch in and, you know, do the heavy lifting on any modifications that the committee requests.

1458
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Thank you.

1459
02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Thank you.

1460
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.500
Representative Bernardi is recognized for a question.

1461
02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:11.500
Thank you, Mr.

1462
02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:13.500
Chairman.

1463
02:32:13.500 --> 02:32:16.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1464
02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:35.500
Is it your understanding that the generation four reactors could be suitably cited, say, at the second pad at the Seabird Station or similar environs, do they still require some degree of cooling water which this ocean provides?

1465
02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:39.000
It's my understanding there are different designs.

1466
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:47.500
Some of them require water, which would be suitable to a site like the second pad site.

1467
02:32:47.500 --> 02:32:54.000
And there are other advanced designs that purport to require no cooling water.

1468
02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:03.000
So they could be sited, you know, in many different locations, including close to the source of consumption.

1469
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:07.000
So that would cut down on transmission costs.

1470
02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
That's my understanding.

1471
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Thank you.

1472
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.500
Representative Ploge is recognized for a question.

1473
02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:16.500
Thank you, Mr.

1474
02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:18.500
Chair.

1475
02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:21.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1476
02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:31.500
I'm with 246 new types of nuclear energy, is there any actual commercial or community reactors processing now, like power?

1477
02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:33.500
Why?

1478
02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:38.500
I'm sorry, I missed the middle part of your question.

1479
02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:41.000
I'll speak into the mic.

1480
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Okay.

1481
02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:49.500
Are there any of these new generation four nuclear plants in operation worldwide?

1482
02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:56.500
It's my understanding that in China, they're moving ahead with this generation four technology.

1483
02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:01.500
They see it as very promising to their energy needs.

1484
02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:08.000
And I believe also in France, but I'd have to double check that.

1485
02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:26.500
The US Department of Energy has a program to accelerate nuclear, these new nuclear reactor types, partnering with private industry, and they're looking to make them commercially available, optimistically five years, but probably more like 10 years.

1486
02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:30.500
and you know know, these are big projects.

1487
02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:42.500
So I think it's wise for our state to start looking at, you know, being attractive to these new projects as they roll out.

1488
02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:44.500
Follow up.

1489
02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:46.500
Follow up.

1490
02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:48.500
Thank you, Mr.

1491
02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:50.500
Chair.

1492
02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:53.500
Thank you for taking this one.

1493
02:34:53.500 --> 02:35:06.000
From what I've seen or read, this idea is efficiency of it when they come out with the numbers of cost to BTUs put out.

1494
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Are really planned, are in a planned community so waste heat can be used and things like that so with things like this be feasible for uh the pad number two where the community is not planned around this plant if it ever gets built thank you thank you yeah i can't speak to the The feasibility of pad number two, I mean, that would take an expert opinion, which I don't speak to the feasibility of pad number two.

1495
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.000
I mean, that would take an expert opinion, which I don't have.

1496
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:59.000
The structure that's there, I believe, would need to be torn down and rebuilt.

1497
02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:13.500
One thing that's really interesting about some of these new designs is that they can utilize spent nuclear fuel, and they have a much higher efficiency of utilizing fuel.

1498
02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:29.000
So one thing that comes to mind, and again, it would take some study to see if it's feasible, but there is a large storage of spent nuclear fuel at Seabrook.

1499
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:59.500
So it's possible that in the not too distant future, instead of just having that fuel sit there and be a concern for the community, it may be possible to reuse it in one of these newer designs and actually not only get a benefit from it in the in the form of electricity, but also reduce the level of waste.

1500
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:10.000
There's some talk like the half-life is in centuries instead of millennia after using spent fuel on these generation four plants.

1501
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.500
One thing I'd also like to say is this is a bipartisan issue.

1502
02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:37.500
And I think you'll find that the younger generation is much more open to this idea in either party than maybe people that remember protests around nuclear power plants that happened in, say, the 70s with technology that was 50 years old.

1503
02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:48.000
So, you know, this gives some hope for the future to the young generation if we pursue this to some degree.

1504
02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Okay, thank you, Representative.

1505
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Is is recognized for a question.

1506
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Thank you, Mr.

1507
02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Chairman.

1508
02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:03.500
I just want to thank the representative for bringing this bill to us.

1509
02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:12.000
The smiling that you saw is because I actually brought a nuclear bill in the last session.

1510
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:31.000
And I'm married to a nuclear nuclear engineer so I know a whole bunch about the next generation stuff and I would actually offer to work with my colleague on this if it were allowed to move forward.

1511
02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:45.500
I think the broadness of the information in the bill currently especially under section B is based on sort of a laundry list of what's out there and available.

1512
02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:56.000
I think some of that has been narrowed in terms of people who actually know what's going on in that field.

1513
02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:03.500
And I've got somebody right here who's an expert I can talk to about it.

1514
02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:09.500
There are a couple of companies that are actually doing projects nearby.

1515
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:22.500
At Point La Preux in New Brunswick, right across the border from Maine, they're putting in a molten salt reactor with a UK company called Moltex.

1516
02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:31.500
And there's another company, I think they're also doing molten salt reactors because they have higher capacity factors.

1517
02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:37.500
They use more of the energy, more efficient, as you were saying.

1518
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:44.000
And that's terrestrial up in Canada, but there are others around the world.

1519
02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:50.000
So it's not really as far away as it used to be.

1520
02:39:50.000 --> 02:40:12.000
So I think it's a great idea for us to take a closer look at it, only because I think the problem in us getting off of fossil fuels has been a lot to do with the fact that we need base load generation.

1521
02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:21.000
So I'm just wondering, it sounds like you're saying this is a forward looking bill, which I appreciate.

1522
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:27.000
And so, and I think Michael Harrington was saying the same thing.

1523
02:40:27.000 --> 02:41:08.000
If the bill could maybe be focused, would you be willing to focus the bill so that it had an objective of what we were trying to achieve with it which is maybe to um you know whether it's cleaning up generation or providing additional beneficial electrification so we can convert the trans you know transportation fleet like if it had some kind of a focus rather than just being sort of a uh an all-encompassing let's take a look at it.

1524
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:16.000
I think it would maybe have better traction because to Representative Harrington's point, it's federally regulated.

1525
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:29.000
So if we don't actually have a specific aim in what we're trying to do, we might not, you know, we might not get very far.

1526
02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:39.500
And it does appear that the federal government is going to be looking for ways to clean up the portfolio quickly.

1527
02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:55.000
So there might actually be some money to come to us to try and achieve something if we could improve the technology that we currently have at Seabrook in some way.

1528
02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Yeah, I'm willing to focus the bill further.

1529
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:08.500
I think the duties list is kind of a throw the spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks.

1530
02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:12.500
But yeah, we could certainly narrow that down.

1531
02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:17.500
I mean, there are some exciting, you know, non-electric applications.

1532
02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:29.000
I think the prospect of using nuclear to generate hydrogen as an energy storage technology, I think that's something that will come eventually.

1533
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:40.500
And water needs with population is also going to require desalinization, which is another thing that these heavy capacity plants are good at.

1534
02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:48.000
Yeah, I mean, heat for industrial processes, that's a byproduct that could be useful, right?

1535
02:42:48.000 --> 02:43:00.000
So, yeah, I'm happy to work with you, Kat, if you want to narrow this down and tap into the expertise in your household.

1536
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:07.500
Well, it sounds like we're going to have a lot of time to do it.

1537
02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:09.500
Yeah, I hope so.

1538
02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:11.500
Enjoy yourself.

1539
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:15.000
I recognize Representative Somsich for a question.

1540
02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Yes, thank you, Mr.

1541
02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Chairman, and thank you, Representative Ammon, for bringing this bill.

1542
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Just because I was mentioned previously about our conversations that I had with Representative Ammon, I just wanted to underscore what he said and confirm that I thought this was a very interesting bill.

1543
02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:46.500
And I too had said I would be willing to work on something like this.

1544
02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:54.000
After all, I have had experience in the nuclear energy industry and issues surrounding it.

1545
02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:12.500
However, as was mentioned, the scope of this bill is just so expansive that, you know, if I wanted to have a couple year project just as a hobby, I could spend lots of time on this.

1546
02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:19.000
I've gone to conferences on one specific area over the last 10 years.

1547
02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.500
So there's a lot to cover here.

1548
02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:29.500
So if it could be narrowed down, it would make a lot of sense.

1549
02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:33.500
But I do have one question as well.

1550
02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:44.500
And that is, don't you think that in fact, a carbon pricing bill, if it's passed, actually would benefit promoting nuclear energy?

1551
02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:54.000
But it, I mean, it depends on how it's engineered by, you know, the people at the top, right?

1552
02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:08.000
So, uh, I think the focus of this bill is more just to see what possibilities there are for our state and just focusing it on nuclear energy.

1553
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:16.500
I'd have to get back to you on the carbon pricing, not knowing the details of it.

1554
02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:18.500
Well, follow up, Mr.

1555
02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:20.500
Chair.

1556
02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:22.500
Follow up.

1557
02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:24.500
Yeah.

1558
02:45:24.500 --> 02:45:32.500
Why I asked this specifically because I've read several articles about this recently in scientific magazines.

1559
02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:43.500
And there is a real opportunity for some nuclear operators to be able to get credit for not being greenhouse gas emitting.

1560
02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:53.000
And if they if that is priced out as part of their energy energy, obviously that would benefit them.

1561
02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Okay, I don't disagree.

1562
02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:04.000
If you think that should be a duty in this bill, then maybe we could consider adding it.

1563
02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Thank you.

1564
02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.500
As part of the equation.

1565
02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:10.500
Thank you, Representative Hammond.

1566
02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:17.000
I remind committee members that we're here to ask questions, not make comments.

1567
02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.500
Representative Jacqueline Callie-Pitts, don't forget to unmute.

1568
02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:30.500
My question is basically for the chair and I want to say first I want to apologize for being late.

1569
02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:35.000
I lose my link every time I close out.

1570
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:38.000
So I don't know what happens.

1571
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Right after the 102 message from Kat, it was gone.

1572
02:46:43.000 --> 02:47:07.000
But I want to thank you also for saying that this is not to comment on the bill and solve what would be a normal committee, subcommittee work session, and people volunteering to work on things now, where I think a lot of people are interested, including myself.

1573
02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:11.500
I was there at the dawn of nuclear age.

1574
02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:30.000
But I would like to know if, and this is for the chair, are we going to be able to volunteer and work on subcommittees on some of these bills that are being retained in the future?

1575
02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.500
I think that question is directed to the chair.

1576
02:47:34.500 --> 02:47:37.000
Yes, to the chair, yes.

1577
02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Absolutely.

1578
02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.500
We'll be putting together study committees on all these retained bills.

1579
02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:52.000
So everybody, in essence, will have a chance to work and listen in on these.

1580
02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Absolutely.

1581
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Thank you.

1582
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.000
That is our standard operating procedure.

1583
02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Right.

1584
02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Right.

1585
02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.500
I just wanted to reiterate.

1586
02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:07.500
Okay.

1587
02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:09.500
Thank you.

1588
02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:11.500
All right.

1589
02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:14.500
I see no more hands raised.

1590
02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:16.500
Oh, yes, I do.

1591
02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:19.500
I see one more hand raised.

1592
02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:23.000
Representative Emmettel is recognized for a question.

1593
02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Thank you, Mr.

1594
02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Chairman.

1595
02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Representative Emmant, this is very intriguing.

1596
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:39.500
I like the idea of us being able to do something with all of that unspent fuel in Seabrook.

1597
02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:52.500
However, I'm wondering how much of a demand do we have in New Hampshire for more generated electricity, seeing as that we do already have Seabrook?

1598
02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:56.500
How much of a demand do we have?

1599
02:48:56.500 --> 02:49:03.500
Are you asking me to predict what the market needs for additional nuclear energy?

1600
02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:06.000
Is that what you're saying?

1601
02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.500
Specifically, the market is there for electricity.

1602
02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:14.000
Certainly, we could be a primary exporter of electricity.

1603
02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:21.500
But what I'm wondering about is, is that the market we want to get into?

1604
02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:28.000
Or do we have a market for that electricity here in New Hampshire?

1605
02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:44.500
Well, I think one interesting thing about this approach, and you kind of have to put your imagination forward into the future, is transmission costs are part of the equation for energy costs.

1606
02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:55.500
And these newer technologies allow smaller reactors, even micro reactors possibly, to be sited very close to where the energy is consumed.

1607
02:49:55.500 --> 02:50:02.000
So you understand that there's loss in the power transmission over long distances.

1608
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.500
I think that partially answers your question.

1609
02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:12.500
you know, you understand that there's loss in the power transmission over long distances.

1610
02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:16.000
I think that partially answers your question.

1611
02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:24.000
You know, energy costs are an issue in New Hampshire and in the region more broadly.

1612
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:38.000
And if we're concerned about removing carbon from our economy, you know, from production, it seems to me nuclear is the clear, is one of the possible solutions.

1613
02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.500
Something to think about, right?

1614
02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:46.500
We talk about renewables, we talk about hydro and solar and wind.

1615
02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:55.000
All three of those energy sources are driven by the sun, which is a giant nuclear reactor.

1616
02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:04.000
So, you know, to think that nuclear power can't be part of the equation, I think is short-sighted.

1617
02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:11.000
And, you know, the market will decide how much need there is for it.

1618
02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Thank you.

1619
02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:18.000
can't be part of the equation, I think is short-sighted.

1620
02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:25.000
And, you know, the market will decide how much need there is for it.

1621
02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:30.000
But at least, you know, New Hampshire is a state.

1622
02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:46.000
We should be investigating and putting some feelers out to see if we can attract interest and, you know, the skill set needed to be able to develop a project like this.

1623
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:52.500
You know, and I think it has to start with a study commission.

1624
02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:57.000
I don't see any other way to do it.

1625
02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:07.500
You know, they're not my favorite type of bills, but because this subject matter is fairly complex, it requires expert input.

1626
02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:15.000
I think we would need a study commission to, you know, move the ball forward.

1627
02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.500
You need a follow-up representative.

1628
02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:19.500
I'm fine.

1629
02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:21.500
Thank you very much.

1630
02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:23.500
Thank you, representative Ammon.

1631
02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:25.500
Thank you, chair.

1632
02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.500
Thank you.

1633
02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:31.500
Thank you, representative Ammon for being here today.

1634
02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:36.500
And the chair now recognizes Representative Harrington for a question.

1635
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:50.500
Yeah, I wasn't going to ask much as a question as a comment, because it seems to be some people get confused over the situation with Seabrook 2.

1636
02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:53.000
There is no Seabrook 2.

1637
02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Everything's gone.

1638
02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
There's land there.

1639
02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:02.000
All the reactor parts and everything have been sold off.

1640
02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:06.000
The pressure, all the pressure vessel, everything's gone.

1641
02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:12.500
The one thing it does has is it does have a cooling capacity.

1642
02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:18.500
It's sufficient for two reactors because that's what it was designed for.

1643
02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:22.500
But I don't really see anybody building there.

1644
02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:30.500
As far as other technologies, someone had asked a question earlier about what was being done.

1645
02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:41.500
Probably the most advanced of the new technologies in the United States is what's referred to as SMRs or small modular reactors.

1646
02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:56.500
And there's a company that just had their initial design phase approved by the NRC and doing negotiations to actually build one of these out in, I think it's Idaho.

1647
02:53:56.500 --> 02:54:07.500
And the advantage of these is that they're built in factories and shipped in units that are, like they say, small modular.

1648
02:54:07.500 --> 02:54:13.000
So typically somewhere in the range of 50 to 80 megawatts.

1649
02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:20.500
And then you can just stack them up to get as much as you need.

1650
02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:23.000
So just a little bit.

1651
02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Mr.

1652
02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:31.500
Chairman, I want to make Representative Harrington aware that we're asking questions here.

1653
02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:34.000
We're not debating nuclear technology.

1654
02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:37.000
That would be a different topic.

1655
02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Thank you.

1656
02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
I appreciate the excitement.

1657
02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I appreciate the excitement.

1658
02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
I appreciate the excitement.

1659
02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I appreciate the excitement.

1660
02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:58.500
I would remind all members that we're here to gather information and ask questions, statements, and comments when we have an executive session.

1661
02:54:58.500 --> 02:55:00.500
Mr.

1662
02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:02.500
Chair?

1663
02:55:02.500 --> 02:55:04.500
Yes, Mr.

1664
02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:06.500
Representative Bannon.

1665
02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:23.500
Yeah, so the modular aspect is very interesting because you could, in the near future, you could start a project very small with, you know, a single unit, as Representative Harrington was talking about.

1666
02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:37.000
And so, you know, the initial commitment could be much smaller than, say, building an entire second reactor, you know, similar to the first one at Seabrook.

1667
02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:45.000
It could literally be, you know, a shipping container size unit as your initial capital outlay.

1668
02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:53.500
And then, you know, you can stack those up over time as investment comes, you know, online.

1669
02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:58.000
So the modular aspect is something in the bill.

1670
02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:01.500
And I think that's kind of exciting.

1671
02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.500
Intriguing idea for sure.

1672
02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:06.000
So thank you, Representative Ammon.

1673
02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:14.000
I have no other questions lined up, and there are no other speakers on this bill.

1674
02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:30.500
Is there anyone in the attendee section who would like to raise their hand and speak on this bill seeing none i'm going to close the public hearing on house bill four 543.

1675
02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:53.500
and i thank representative and for being here to support the bill and introduce the bill before Before we close the hearing officially, I will point out that there were five people who signed up to support the bill, four who signed up to oppose it.

1676
02:56:53.500 --> 02:57:02.000
And there was one elected official who signed it and supported the bill that was representative .

1677
02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:18.000
So with that, we'll close the public hearing on house bill 543 and we will exit to executive session and i will recognize representative murder for a motion on House Bill 410.

1678
02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Yes, House Bill 410.

1679
02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.500
I make a motion that we retain the bill.

1680
02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:27.000
The chair recognizes Representative Kloge.

1681
02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:30.500
I'd like to second that motion, Mr.

1682
02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:32.500
Chair.

1683
02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:54.000
So Representative Myrner has moved that we retain house bill 410 and representative floje has seconded that motion is there any discussion Seeing none, I ask the clerk, the acting clerk, to call the roll on the motion to retain House Bill 410.

1684
02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
543, isn't it?

1685
02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.500
I thank Representative Nott for running out and getting me more.

1686
02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:03.500
543.

1687
02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:05.500
No, no, 410.

1688
02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:07.500
410.

1689
02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:09.500
We're doing 410.

1690
02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:11.500
410.

1691
02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:13.500
Oh, 410.

1692
02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:15.500
We're backing up.

1693
02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:17.500
Okay.

1694
02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:19.500
Okay.

1695
02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:24.000
Motion moved and seconded to retain House Bill 410.

1696
02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Representative Thomas.

1697
02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Yes.

1698
02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Representative Harrington.

1699
02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Yes.

1700
02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Representative Nodda.

1701
02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Yes.

1702
02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Representative Myrna.

1703
02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Yes.

1704
02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Representative Humala.

1705
02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Yes.

1706
02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Representative Fumala, yes.

1707
02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
Representative Resney, yes.

1708
02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Representative Bernadette, yes.

1709
02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Representative Kimbrough, yes.

1710
02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Representative Ploje, yes.

1711
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Representative White, yes.

1712
02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
Representative Sausage.

1713
02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Unmute.

1714
02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Oh sorry.

1715
02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Yes.

1716
02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Representative Callie Pitts.

1717
02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Yes.

1718
02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Representative Meehan.

1719
02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
Yes.

1720
02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
Representative Oxenham.

1721
02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000

You said Keishin.

03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:20.500
Yes.

1797
03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:22.500
Kishin.

1798
03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:24.500
Yes.

1799
03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.500
Kishin.

1800
03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:29.000
Kishin, that's what I said.

1801
03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
You said Kishin.

1802
03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000

Representative Pimentel.

I make a motion to retain House Bill 382.

1815
03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.500
The chair recognizes Representative Bernardi.

1816
03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:19.500
Excuse me?

1817
03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:21.500

1819
03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:25.500
Last session.

1820
03:03:25.500 --> 03:03:31.500
House Bill 382 was heard on friday yes and we voted 21.

1824
03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Chair?

1825
03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:55.500
So I guess I forgot that right?

1826
03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:57.500
We understand that.

1827
03:03:57.500 --> 03:04:01.000
Representative McGee, did you have a question?

1828
03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:04.500
Yes, I'd like to make a motion.

1829
03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:06.500
What's the motion?

1830
03:04:06.500 --> 03:04:13.500
I'd like to make a motion to retain House Bill session for each bill.

1831
03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:17.500
I't open an exec session for hb 394.

1832
03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:23.000
so the members we can't uh we can't come from you.

1833
03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.500
It's not from the chair.

1834
03:04:25.500 --> 03:04:27.500
Oh, OK.

1835
03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:30.000
It hasn't been opened yet.

1836
03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
Hasn't been opened.

1837
03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:37.500
We didn't, I did not open HB 394 for exact session.

1838
03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:39.500
That's true.

1839
03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:48.000
I was trying to figure out what we did on Friday that I forgot to write down.

1840
03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
410 was today, Mr.

1841
03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
Chair.

1842
03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:58.500
For example, we did an executive session and I just made a motion.

1843
03:04:58.500 --> 03:05:02.500
So it's a pending motion in exact session.

1844
03:05:02.500 --> 03:05:08.500
We voted on a bill today as well as one from Friday.

1845
03:05:08.500 --> 03:05:11.500
We retained 169, 20 to 1.

1846
03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:13.500
Did we retain 169?

1847
03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:15.500
Yes, we did.

1848
03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:19.500
We ended up doing a, 20 to one.

1849
03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:21.500
Did retain 169?

1850
03:05:21.500 --> 03:05:23.500
Yes, we did.

1851
03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:28.000
We ended up doing a retaining 20 to one.

1852
03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
Yes.

1853
03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:35.000
The only thing we did in build on was 614.

1854
03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:39.000
That was the last one of the day.

1855
03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Yeah, we didn't get the 614.

1856
03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:48.500
Why don't we do HB, I'll open an exec session on HB 614.

1857
03:05:48.500 --> 03:05:52.000
I have a question for the chair.

1858
03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Yes, Representative Galevich.

1859
03:05:54.000 --> 03:06:11.000
Question is, if the bill was done prior, it's not noticed in the calendar for executive session, can we exec it on another day, just pull it out of the hat and exec it?

1860
03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:15.500
Yes, you can call exec session at any time.

1861
03:06:15.500 --> 03:06:38.500
I understand that, but if it's not noticed, if that bill is not noticed, it says in here that executive sessions can be called throughout the meeting by, you know, so can we just exec something or do we have to put it on the calendar?

1862
03:06:38.500 --> 03:06:41.000
That is a good question.

1863
03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:46.000
I'm pretty sure we can just exact bills as necessary.

1864
03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:58.500
I can remember in past years we've had exec sessions where we did seven or eight bills and they were not listed on the calendar.

1865
03:06:58.500 --> 03:07:00.500
Okay, I'm just wondering.

1866
03:07:00.500 --> 03:07:02.500
Thank you.

1867
03:07:02.500 --> 03:07:04.500
Any questions?

1868
03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:08.500
Jennifer, I'm going to ask you a question.

1869
03:07:08.500 --> 03:07:10.500
Yes.

1870
03:07:10.500 --> 03:07:27.500
Do you know, as our committee researcher, if we need to call an exec session for a bill on the same day that the bill is, that the public hearing for the bill occurs?

1871
03:07:27.500 --> 03:08:00.500
Or if we do it on a different day, does it have to be listed in the calendar do you know that the language in the calendar says executive session on pending legislation may be held throughout the day time permitting from the time the committee is initially convened so any pending legislation legislation would imply that it could be any bill from any day, correct?

1872
03:08:00.500 --> 03:08:02.500
That is my understanding.

1873
03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:05.000
It doesn't really say that.

1874
03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:09.500
The question is what does the last clause modify?

1875
03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:17.000
Why does it have that remark in there about from the opening of the day?

1876
03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
That language?

1877
03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
I don't know.

1878
03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:24.000
That language came from the clerk.

1879
03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
Muddies the water.

1880
03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:29.000
Not sure exactly what that means.

1881
03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:36.500
Maybe held throughout the day, time permitting, from the time the committee is initially convened.

1882
03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:50.000
So I think that means that you can start the day with an executive session, or you can do an executive session three times during the day.

1883
03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.500
That would be my interpretation.

1884
03:08:52.500 --> 03:08:59.000
And would that bring us back to the pending motion on the floor?

1885
03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
No.

1886
03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:07.500
Not until we resolve the issue about opening and closing each executive session.

1887
03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:10.000
It's not one executive session?

1888
03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
Apparently not.

1889
03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:16.500
Because I did open an executive session on 394.

1890
03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:18.500
Yes, Representative Nutter.

1891
03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:22.000
We can also call Paul for clarification.

1892
03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:28.000
But I remember from previous years they opened and closed each session.

1893
03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:32.500
And I think you did forget a couple times.

1894
03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:38.000
And that's like I kind of thrown off like, wait, what?

1895
03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:42.000
How did we get to the next vote?

1896
03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:45.000
So you do have to close.

1897
03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
We're going to close.

1898
03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
Open and close.

1899
03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
We can't hear that.

1900
03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
Is that correct?

1901
03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
Yes.

1902
03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:00.000
So do we have to go back and redo then?

1903
03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
No.

1904
03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000
410 and 543?

1905
03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
No.

1906
03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.500
How would that vote be?

1907
03:10:08.500 --> 03:10:11.500
Well, we've already voted now, so.

1908
03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:29.000
Well, since the votes were unanimous, I'm going to assume that even though I made a mistake on that, which I apologize for, we can go forward with the decision we made on those bills.

1909
03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:32.000
Is there any objection to that?

1910
03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
Representative Somsich?

1911
03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
Now, Kat.

1912
03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
No, I don't object.

1913
03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
You're OK with that.

1914
03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
Thank you.

1915
03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:47.000
OK, then I'll open an exec session on HB 614.

1916
03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:50.500
And Representative Thomas will make a motion.

1917
03:10:50.500 --> 03:10:52.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

1918
03:10:52.500 --> 03:10:56.000
Representative Harrington is recognized for a motion.

1919
03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:01.500
Excuse me, I have a little trouble hearing what was that?

1920
03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:05.500
You're recognized for an emotion, for a motion.

1921
03:11:05.500 --> 03:11:07.500
On what bill?

1922
03:11:07.500 --> 03:11:13.000
I move that we amend HB 614 with amendment number 2021-0156H.

1923
03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
Okay, so moved.

1924
03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
Chair recognizes Representative Thomas.

1925
03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
Second.

1926
03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:32.500
So it's been moved and seconded that we uh amend hb 614 with amendment number 2021-0156h which was sent to all of your legislative email Thursday, 2020-21-0156H.

1927
03:11:32.500 --> 03:11:36.500
So, do we have any discussion, Representative Somsich?

1928
03:11:36.500 --> 03:11:38.500
Sorry, Mr.

1929
03:11:38.500 --> 03:11:42.000
Chairman, I didn't lower my hand before.

1930
03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.500
I didn't have it up.

1931
03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:46.500
Oh, sorry.

1932
03:11:46.500 --> 03:11:48.500
Okay.

1933
03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:50.500
Representative Medina.

1934
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:52.500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

1935
03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:54.500
Chairman.

1936
03:11:54.500 --> 03:12:15.000
So I think everyone should probably refer to this amendment before we vote to accept it because it materially changes the bill in a significant way, I think, in terms of the exemptions that it now provides from system benefits charge.

1937
03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:26.000
So I don't know if Representative Harrington wants to speak to it or is it or is this your bill, Chairman Bowes?

1938
03:12:26.000 --> 03:13:20.500
I don who presented this your bill yes I submitted this amendment we've been over it extensively during the public hearing last Friday if you have a specific question I'd be happy to answer it um actually we did not because I read it I read I read the some of the amendments to bring people's attention to the fact that the amendment you had mentioned that the amendment had removed the language around the alternative compliance payment I believe but you neglected to mention that B and C under the new amendment provided further exclusions from providers of electricity being able to be subject to the compliance payments.

1939
03:13:20.500 --> 03:13:38.500
And also that all competitive electricity suppliers shall negotiate with any service, political subdivision, or state agency a contract that provides a rate that excludes costs of compliance with the renewable portfolio standard under RSA 362-F.

1940
03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:57.000
So this is a huge change to the ability of the state to secure any funding for energy efficiency, and it would also have a downstream impact on the energy efficiency docket and three-year plan that's pending.

1941
03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:14.500
So it's a very significant monetary change to the economy, the energy economy, and I think people ought to know that and know what they're voting for before we move forward with rushing this amendment.

1942
03:14:14.500 --> 03:14:23.000
First of all, let me just say that you are not correct about what you just said.

1943
03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:31.000
the language of section B, providers of electricity shall not be subject to compliance, et cetera.

1944
03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:35.000
That came directly from the public facilities commission.

1945
03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:38.500
And it refers back to paragraph A.

1946
03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:50.500
And it basically just says that regulated utilities like Eversource, Humatill, are not set, shall exempt basically political subdivisions from compliance under RSA 362.3.

1947
03:14:50.500 --> 03:14:53.000
So that's not anything new.

1948
03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:57.000
That was the original intention of the bill.

1949
03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:04.500
It just wasn't worded very well until the Public and Coordination Commission provided this language.

1950
03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:17.000
And then Section C about competitive electricity suppliers was added to the bill because the PUC pointed out that they don't regulate competitive electricity suppliers.

1951
03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:41.000
And therefore, if this bill is going to apply to them, and many political subdivisions do buy their electricity from competitive electricity suppliers, including the state of New Hampshire, then this new language would be necessary to get them to comply with the exemption that the bill provides.

1952
03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:53.000
So that's why this language was added to the amendment, because it actually allows the bill to do what it originally intended to do.

1953
03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:56.500
And the language came from the public.

1954
03:15:56.500 --> 03:15:58.500
I'm sorry, Mr.

1955
03:15:58.500 --> 03:16:25.000
Chair, but I don't, I don't, I'm reading the words and it's basically saying if a subdivision decides that they're not going to pay the system benefits charge, then the electricity provider can also decide that they don't have to pay it either, which means no one pays it, which means it's eliminated.

1956
03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:29.500
So that is a significant change in the law.

1957
03:16:29.500 --> 03:16:31.500
That's what it says.

1958
03:16:31.500 --> 03:16:43.000
So they're asking, the utilities are asking you to make sure that they no longer have to comply with the system benefits charge.

1959
03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:46.000
And that's how I read it.

1960
03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:50.000
Maybe a concrete example and help explain it.

1961
03:16:50.000 --> 03:17:26.000
So let's say the town of Bepping chooses not to take advantage of section d and by a majority vote of its governing body collects to continue payments it wants to in fact be exempt from making payments its provider is eversource what this bill does is it allows Eversource to essentially subtract from its load the kilowatt hours that the town of Epping would use over the course of a year.

1962
03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:43.000
So at the end of the year, when it computes the number of kilowatt hours that it must report to be in compliance with the RPS RSA32F3, the kilowatt hours from Epping are excluded.

1963
03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:46.000
That's essentially what that language says.

1964
03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:57.000
Yes, and it translates to exactly what I said, which is that it means that neither of them will pay the compliance.

1965
03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:09.000
It gets shifted and then eliminated, which is the opposite of what the original legislation, it undoes the legislation that as it stands today.

1966
03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000
It undoes the requirement.

1967
03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:14.500
What do some divisions pay the RPS?

1968
03:18:14.500 --> 03:18:18.000
Representative Pementel, we're recognized for a comment.

1969
03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:20.000
Thank you, Mr.

1970
03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.000
Chairman.

1971
03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:29.500
The original legislation, the intent of the original legislation, was to fund energy efficiency programs.

1972
03:18:29.500 --> 03:18:38.500
And this bill circumvents that and will, in effect, reduce the amount of money for energy efficiency programs.

1973
03:18:38.500 --> 03:18:45.500
So it's totally counter to the original purpose of the bill, of the legislation.

1974
03:18:45.500 --> 03:18:47.500
Thank you, Representative Sonsich.

1975
03:18:47.500 --> 03:18:49.500
Thank you, Mr.

1976
03:18:49.500 --> 03:18:51.500
Chairman.

1977
03:18:51.500 --> 03:18:58.000
I want to echo the comments made by Representative McGee and the others.

1978
03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:16.000
that this is a way of reducing the funding that's available for energy efficiency programs, while at the same time allowing entities who don't pay into it to be able to benefit from energy efficiency programs.

1979
03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:21.500
Yeah, that would be nice if we could all do that.

1980
03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:25.000
We don't have to pay for it.

1981
03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:28.000
We just get it for free.

1982
03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:35.500
Now, our generation of those over 20 usually are used to paying our own way.

1983
03:19:35.500 --> 03:19:39.500
We don't expect free to be the norm.

1984
03:19:39.500 --> 03:19:47.500
But this is a way of getting a free deal without having to pay for it.

1985
03:19:47.500 --> 03:19:49.500
That's pretty outrageous.

1986
03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:55.500
And it does go contrary to the intentions of the original legislation.

1987
03:19:55.500 --> 03:20:01.000
In fact, it goes contrary to the governor's 10-year energy plan.

1988
03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:07.000
It goes contrary to the state's energy report, which just came out.

1989
03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:13.500
Everything that we discuss here in this bill is going the opposite direction.

1990
03:20:13.500 --> 03:20:17.000
So I think it's a bad bill.

1991
03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:26.500
We heard testimony from a number of energy producers saying that this would hurt them, local New Hampshire generators.

1992
03:20:26.500 --> 03:20:31.500
So I think we should not agree to pass this.

1993
03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:33.500
Thank you.

1994
03:20:33.500 --> 03:20:35.500
Thank you, Representative Oxenam.

1995
03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:39.000
Thank you for taking my question, Mr.

1996
03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
Chair.

1997
03:20:41.000 --> 03:21:00.500
It's, we don't have any, I understand there's an FN, there's a financial note on the bill, but with the amendment, we have nothing that updates us as to the consequences of this decision were we to pass it.

1998
03:21:00.500 --> 03:21:03.000
Am I understanding that correctly?

1999
03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:15.500
I'm pretty sure that the folks who did the financial fiscal note, I'm pretty sure the folks who did that did not see this amendment.

2000
03:21:15.500 --> 03:21:28.500
So no, you're correct i have not evaluated follow-up i The fiscal note, I'm pretty sure the folks who did that did not see this amendment.

2001
03:21:28.500 --> 03:21:30.500
So no, you're correct.

2002
03:21:30.500 --> 03:21:33.000
They have not evaluated that.

2003
03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000
Follow up?

2004
03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000
Follow up.

2005
03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:44.500
I know on Friday that you made the surprising statement that the money doesn't matter.

2006
03:21:44.500 --> 03:21:56.000
But it really does matter enormously if what we're doing here, if we're taking this action without knowing the fiscal and financial consequences.

2007
03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:01.500
So I cannot support the bill, the amendment to the bill.

2008
03:22:01.500 --> 03:22:03.500
Thank you.

2009
03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:05.500
Thank you.

2010
03:22:05.500 --> 03:22:09.000
I can't let that statement go unchallenged.

2011
03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:12.500
I never said the money doesn't matter.

2012
03:22:12.500 --> 03:22:15.500
Obviously, it matters to the taxpayers.

2013
03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:45.000
I think the reference was with regard to something i said about the approximately five million dollar cost of this bill as being the equivalent of a coffee cup of coffee a day and a lot of people have asserted that the five million dollars in an earlier bill, it was roughly a couple copies a day, didn't matter.

2014
03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:48.500
I was equating it to those things.

2015
03:22:48.500 --> 03:22:52.000
I wasn't saying it didn't matter myself.

2016
03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:59.000
Okay, so is there anyone else who would like to speak on this bill?

2017
03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:05.500
Representative Somsich, I assume your hand is still up from earlier or not.

2018
03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:07.500
Thank you.

2019
03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:09.500
on this bill?

2020
03:23:09.500 --> 03:23:16.000
Representative Somsich, I assume your hand is still up from earlier or not.

2021
03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.000
I'm saying Representative Foxenner.

2022
03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:20.000
Yes.

2023
03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:22.000
Can you hear me?

2024
03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:24.000
Yes.

2025
03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.000
Excellent.

2026
03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:32.000
You made the comment when we were talking about the SEC bill.

2027
03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:48.000
You did not make that comment with reference to this, but I'm still surprised by the concept when we're talking about any bill that one would say that the money didn't matter.

2028
03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:50.500
But we'll let that pass.

2029
03:23:50.500 --> 03:23:54.000
Do the chair recognize as Representative Bernardi?

2030
03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.000
Thank you, Mr.

2031
03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:58.000
Chairman.

2032
03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:01.500
This is just a point of clarification.

2033
03:24:01.500 --> 03:24:11.500
My understanding of this amendment is essentially is some perfecting language to make sure that the bill is well understood.

2034
03:24:11.500 --> 03:24:43.000
But the fundamental principle here and the fiscal consequences of this is about $5 million is going to be saved from the state and municipal taxpayers and that's the objective of the bill and the amendment just makes that very clear you might correct that assessment yes it is exactly the intention of the amendment was to clarify the purpose of the bill.

2035
03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000
Representative McGee.

2036
03:24:45.000 --> 03:25:22.500
Um, I think that that may be how folks are understanding the bill, but in terms of what the bill actually does to Representative Oxenham's point, we do not have an understanding of the economic impact to the RPS programs and to energy efficiency in general if this bill is passed, because what it does is it allows municipalities to take a pass and say, we don't want to pay any money for that anymore.

2037
03:25:22.500 --> 03:25:33.000
So those programs that the state is trying to help lower everyone's bills with, we're not going to contribute to it.

2038
03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:47.000
And if they decide that they're going to pass on it, then their providers, meaning the utilities in this case, will also be able to waive that charge.

2039
03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:55.500
And other electric providers, it appears in the next section, will also have to deduct that charge.

2040
03:25:55.500 --> 03:26:05.000
So what we're doing is we're eliminating a significant funding source for a program that benefits all rate payers.

2041
03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:08.000
That's how I understand the bill.

2042
03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:13.500
And although we can say, yes, it's this, yes, it's that.

2043
03:26:13.500 --> 03:26:22.500
If what I am saying is not correct, then this is the time for us to discuss that.

2044
03:26:22.500 --> 03:26:28.000
Because we haven't discussed what our aim is with this bill.

2045
03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:40.000
But what I'm saying is the consequence of the bill appears to be that we are going to be cutting off our own noses.

2046
03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:53.500
We're going to be hamstringing the state to be able to lower costs for people, which was the whole idea behind the RPS in the first place.

2047
03:26:53.500 --> 03:26:55.500
Okay, thank you.

2048
03:26:55.500 --> 03:27:12.000
I'm going to take a brief time out here, and I am going to open the public hearing on House Bill 153, and immediately call a recess until we finish this executive session.

2049
03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:16.000
Does anybody else have any comments to make?

2050
03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:18.000
Yes, indeed.

2051
03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000
Representative Oxen.

2052
03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:22.000
Yes.

2053
03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:31.500
Unfortunately, this year, we did not have any orientation specifically directed to the energy efficiency policies of the state.

2054
03:27:31.500 --> 03:27:36.500
We didn't get a thorough grounding in RGGI or RPS.

2055
03:27:36.500 --> 03:27:45.000
As a result, people are not, don't have the capability to understand what this bill is doing.

2056
03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:53.500
In particular, every, we have a cost benefit analysis requirement for any energy savings, energy efficiency work.

2057
03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:59.000
And in general, for every dollar that's spent, it's $4 gained.

2058
03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:17.000
So when you're taking away the money from these programs, which are the negawatts, the best way for us to be not wasting energy, not polluting for no reason, getting houses made safer, healthier, more comfortable.

2059
03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:31.000
All of these programs that are part of state policy, you're saying, oh, let's take the money away because it's going to save the municipals some tax money.

2060
03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:35.000
You're very, very much what Representative McGee said.

2061
03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:39.500
You're cutting off your nose to spite your face.

2062
03:28:39.500 --> 03:28:44.000
You're taking away our primary lever for moving forward.

2063
03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:50.500
It's a short-sighted measure with, you know, we're going to lower your taxes.

2064
03:28:50.500 --> 03:28:59.000
I find it unfathomable that we're proceeding with this as if this was just business as usual.

2065
03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:05.500
This is demolishing a major element of the governor's program of state policy.

2066
03:29:05.500 --> 03:29:08.000
You're taking away the money.

2067
03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:13.500
You can't do the programs if you don't have the money.

2068
03:29:13.500 --> 03:29:15.500
Thank you, Mr.

2069
03:29:15.500 --> 03:29:17.500
Chairman.

2070
03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:29.500
My understanding, the principle and body here is very similar to the same principle as the state police or any other folks buying gas.

2071
03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:33.500
They are exempt from paying the gas tax.

2072
03:29:33.500 --> 03:29:44.000
This is the same concept as we are exempting the state and municipalities from the consequences of paying the gas tax.

2073
03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:54.000
This is the same concept as we are exempting the state and municipalities from the consequences of paying these payments.

2074
03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:57.500
But in principle, everyone else is paying.

2075
03:29:57.500 --> 03:30:01.500
So that's the concept that's on the table.

2076
03:30:01.500 --> 03:30:03.500
And that's the concept.

2077
03:30:03.500 --> 03:30:06.000
I believe you're trying to.

2078
03:30:06.000 --> 03:30:08.000
That is correct.

2079
03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:10.000
Representative Cretien.

2080
03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:12.000
Mr.

2081
03:30:12.000 --> 03:30:26.500
Chair, just on that last point about making this analogous to the gas tax, I don't think that that's accurate based on the testimony that we heard on Friday.

2082
03:30:26.500 --> 03:30:41.500
We heard that it's much more challenging to untangle who qualifies for this discount and who would not adding a substantial burden actually to the people who are calculating this.

2083
03:30:41.500 --> 03:30:59.000
I also, I guess, just wanted to make the point that we heard the argument that we are returning money to the taxpayers so that they can decide how they want to spend that money.

2084
03:30:59.000 --> 03:31:12.500
I think in passing the original legislation, we are reflecting that our constituents do want to spend their money on programs like energy efficiency and energy savings.

2085
03:31:12.500 --> 03:31:18.500
And that's why they elected us to represent them to do that.

2086
03:31:18.500 --> 03:31:26.000
It's not something that you can do with a dollar a month, these big projects.

2087
03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:48.000
And it's just ridiculous to me that we're, I don't know, I feel like we're in dereliction of our duty to come together as a group representing the people of New Hampshire and get things done that the people can't do on their own.

2088
03:31:48.000 --> 03:31:50.500
That's what government is for.

2089
03:31:50.500 --> 03:31:52.500
Thank you, Representative Saussure.

2090
03:31:52.500 --> 03:31:54.500
Thank you, Mr.

2091
03:31:54.500 --> 03:31:56.500
Chair.

2092
03:31:56.500 --> 03:32:04.000
I want to just add to what was said about the impact of this bill.

2093
03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:18.500
First of all, it is true that because we don't have an updated fiscal note on the amendment of consequences, it's hard to estimate exactly what's going to happen.

2094
03:32:18.500 --> 03:32:29.000
However, this is not just about eliminating a certain amount of money from a pot that's being used for energy efficiency.

2095
03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:38.000
Yes, it is true that short-term municipalities and other entities could have a small fiscal gain from this.

2096
03:32:38.000 --> 03:32:51.500
But long-term, they will have a bigger negative impact fiscally compared to what they're doing now, and that is subscribing to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.

2097
03:32:51.500 --> 03:32:54.000
Those projects currently are oversubscribed.

2098
03:32:54.000 --> 03:33:02.000
More people want to do that and municipalities want to do it than we can support.

2099
03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:15.000
And as was mentioned, every single project is scrutinized heavily to see if in a cost-benefit analysis, do we get more benefit than it costs us?

2100
03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:21.500
And only if it does get more benefit than cost is it approved.

2101
03:33:21.500 --> 03:33:36.000
So to say, let's cut back that funding so we can save a little money now, we're not going to gain those savings and benefits if we don't invest.

2102
03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:40.500
In fact, this is all about investing versus spending.

2103
03:33:40.500 --> 03:33:42.500
There's a big difference.

2104
03:33:42.500 --> 03:33:53.000
You go to the casino in Las Vegas with $1,000 and you lose it all and you get nothing for it.

2105
03:33:53.000 --> 03:34:05.000
You take that $1,000 and invest it in energy efficiency, you're going to get savings, monetary savings for the next 20 years from that.

2106
03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:07.000
That's an investment.

2107
03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.500
That's not a spending issue.

2108
03:34:09.500 --> 03:34:11.500
Thank you.

2109
03:34:11.500 --> 03:34:13.500
Thank you, Representative.

2110
03:34:13.500 --> 03:34:24.000
As we discussed, I think it was probably either in one of the orientation sessions we had or possibly last Friday.

2111
03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:33.500
This whole Zoom format or holding public hearings, this hybrid format, is a learning experience for all of us.

2112
03:34:33.500 --> 03:34:51.000
And one of the things that I just recently learned just in the last few minutes is that there's no good way to distribute amendments to the general public who is listening in Thank you.

2113
03:34:51.000 --> 03:35:21.500
there's no good way to distribute amendments to the general public who is listening in on this public hearing and executive session as a result they're totally in the dark about what the amendment contains and i don't necessarily think that's a good situation And it's one of the limitations of this format that is causing, I think, a major problem.

2114
03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:37.000
So I'm going to recess this executive session until we can figure out a way to distribute the amendment more widely to people so that people can know what's going on.

2115
03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:45.000
I'm also going to try to get a fiscal analysis of the amendment if that's possible.

2116
03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:50.500
I'm not sure it is, but we'll give it a try.

2117
03:35:50.500 --> 03:35:58.500
So we'll recess this executive session until our next meeting, which is probably February the 8th.

2118
03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:05.000
But before I do that, I'll recognize Representative Michael Harrington for a comment.

2119
03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000
Mr.

2120
03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:12.000
Chairman, I'll just wait for the woman to come back.

2121
03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:15.500
There's no, I can hold my comments.

2122
03:36:15.500 --> 03:36:17.500
Thank you.

2123
03:36:17.500 --> 03:36:19.500
I'm sorry.

2124
03:36:19.500 --> 03:36:21.500
I didn't understand.

2125
03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:23.500
You'll wait for what?

2126
03:36:23.500 --> 03:36:31.500
I don't, I, I'll just wait until we, we, we come back up on this one.

2127
03:36:31.500 --> 03:36:41.000
Since you're going to recess it, I I'll just hold my comments until we bring the bill up again.

2128
03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:43.000
Oh, okay.

2129
03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:45.000
I understand.

2130
03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:47.000
All right.

2131
03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:54.500
So let's, I'm going to recess and reconvene the public hearing on house bill 153.

2132
03:36:54.500 --> 03:37:04.000
And I'm going to call on the prime sponsor of HPB 153, Representative Oxen, I'm gonna introduce the bill.

2133
03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.000
Thank you, Mr.

2134
03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:08.000
Chairman.

2135
03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:10.000
We're now at 2.11.

2136
03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:22.000
Is it my understanding that we will have enough time for this bill or will we be cut off when we reach three o'clock?

2137
03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:26.500
Do you know how many people wish to speak?

2138
03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:31.000
Well, we have seven people signed up to speak.

2139
03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:37.000
So if you could introduce it briefly, that would be gratefully appreciated.

2140
03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000
Okie dokie.

2141
03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:45.000
I don't think I have to tell anyone how important broadband is.

2142
03:37:45.000 --> 03:38:03.500
We've all experienced over the past year the fact that to get to work, for your kids to go to school, to have telemedicine, to have emergency services, we have to have good quality, high speed broadband.

2143
03:38:03.500 --> 03:38:09.500
And it needs to be available to every resident of the state.

2144
03:38:09.500 --> 03:38:14.500
Just as a century ago, we pushed out rural electrification.

2145
03:38:14.500 --> 03:38:25.500
We need to be proactive in making sure that New Hampshire is welcoming to businesses who want to move their operations here.

2146
03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:31.500
They won't come if they can't have guaranteed access to high-speed internet.

2147
03:38:31.500 --> 03:38:34.000
We want a young cohort.

2148
03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:45.000
If we want a new demographic moving into our state, we have to be able to provide high-speed quality broadband and internet.

2149
03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:48.000
So recognizing broadband expansion is critical.

2150
03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:52.000
It's not only an issue for rural areas.

2151
03:38:52.000 --> 03:39:06.500
In urban areas, we have broadband deserts where, because of affordability, because of the language, for a variety of reasons, there are obstacles to the proper expansion of broadband.

2152
03:39:06.500 --> 03:39:11.000
Municipal governments, business establishments lack the infrastructure for connectivity.

2153
03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:16.500
Rural areas, we spoke about the problem of low population density.

2154
03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:22.500
Companies don't want to go those extra miles for very few residences.

2155
03:39:22.500 --> 03:39:26.500
Why then should we have a study committee?

2156
03:39:26.500 --> 03:39:29.000
What will that get us?

2157
03:39:29.000 --> 03:40:36.000
In speaking with the companies that provide the service, I was informed that they really want to get a stakeholder session together where we can talk across the table and come to a negotiated settlement, but come to a meeting of the minds about how best to go forward so we don't waste money, so that we operate efficiently, and we get the service into the hands of the people who need them as possible as fast as possible right now in my town the plainfield we have tesla's satellite starlink is is coming in the new hampshire electric cooperative is bringing fiber across the state are those things going to interconnect are are they going to is it going to pose an issue if one goes forward while the other one is not?

2158
03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:41.000
Getting everyone into the room makes a lot of sense.

2159
03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:53.000
If this were a regulated industry, the PUC would be the ideal place to do this in an investigatory docket, but it's not regulated.

2160
03:40:53.000 --> 03:41:06.500
And so the only opportunity to bring the different parties to the table, municipalities, businesses, the companies that are the providers, would be through a study committee.

2161
03:41:06.500 --> 03:41:10.500
And so that's what I have produced here.

2162
03:41:10.500 --> 03:41:14.000
And I, please, pardon me for misspeaking.

2163
03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:20.500
I picked up this bill when Representative Ken Wells, unfortunately, was not reelected.

2164
03:41:20.500 --> 03:41:22.500
This was Ken's bill.

2165
03:41:22.500 --> 03:41:34.500
And Ken, I'm sure, is waiting patiently to get on the line and tell you much more about why it needs to go forward.

2166
03:41:34.500 --> 03:41:46.500
And so I will cede my extra minutes as so-called sponsor to the actual sponsor if the chair is willing to make that available.

2167
03:41:46.500 --> 03:41:48.500
Thank you.

2168
03:41:48.500 --> 03:41:50.500
Thank you, Representative Voxenum.

2169
03:41:50.500 --> 03:41:59.500
So it is your desire that I next recognize Ken Wells to speak on behalf of this bill?

2170
03:41:59.500 --> 03:42:04.000
I ask that you do so, yes, thank you.

2171
03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:10.500
All right, I recognize Ken Wells to speak on behalf of the bill.

2172
03:42:10.500 --> 03:42:12.500
And Mr.

2173
03:42:12.500 --> 03:42:22.000
Wells, you are- Thank you very much, Chairman Vose, and honorable members of the Science, Technology, and Energy Committee.

2174
03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:28.000
Thank you in advance for a few minutes of your kind attention.

2175
03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:35.500
I hope that you all have received my written testimony and have it before you.

2176
03:42:35.500 --> 03:42:40.000
I sent it to you via email on Friday.

2177
03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:48.500
New Hampshire can boast that about 88% of its households have smartphones or computers with internet access.

2178
03:42:48.500 --> 03:42:56.000
However, the unserved 12% remainder represents 78,000 households in New Hampshire with zero internet access.

2179
03:42:56.000 --> 03:43:09.500
Full high-speed broadband access is unavailable to 23% of rural households and may be unavailable to more than 80% of the residents in some New Hampshire towns.

2180
03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:18.500
Even in New Hampshire's urban areas, low-income and minority neighborhoods frequently lack sufficient high-speed bandwidth to meet demand.

2181
03:43:18.500 --> 03:43:25.000
I'm going to focus right now on the rural aspect of this problem.

2182
03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:30.000
Today, towns must go it alone for universal broadband acquisition.

2183
03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:45.000
The existing RSA 53G creates a path for individual towns and their municipal partners to create an entity that can contract for district-wide services, but only on a piecemeal basis.

2184
03:43:45.000 --> 03:44:03.500
Each town would have to create its own administrative units, possibly beginning with their existing planning committee, which would then create a body called the Communication District, as well as a governing board for the Communication District.

2185
03:44:03.500 --> 03:44:13.000
As the law stands now, this effort would have to be duplicated by every other municipality across the state.

2186
03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:24.500
The municipalities that most need better broadband, particularly poor and rural communities, will be the least well-equipped to navigate this administrative process successfully.

2187
03:44:24.500 --> 03:44:32.500
What's unique about House Bill 153 is that it addresses the administrative obstacles to universal broadband.

2188
03:44:32.500 --> 03:44:40.500
Universal broadband access for all New Hampshire households and businesses should be a state policy goal.

2189
03:44:40.500 --> 03:45:02.500
The proposed legislation would create a study committee to identify the most effective way to achieve wholesale universal broadband access across the state for every resident of every municipality in New Hampshire, while avoiding the duplicative and redundant administrative mechanism described in RSA 53G.

2190
03:45:02.500 --> 03:45:27.500
The newly enacted House Bill 1111 from last session introduced new language into Section 3 of RS 33 Part 3G that essentially says that if an ISP does not respond to a request for information about served locations, within two months the municipality may declare that area to be unserved.

2191
03:45:27.500 --> 03:45:36.500
In which case, the municipality may issue RFPs and the ISP is at risk of losing that territory.

2192
03:45:36.500 --> 03:45:50.500
So at this point, I'd like to pause and direct your attention to my written testimony, which includes a synopsis of the unwieldy procedure required in current statute.

2193
03:45:50.500 --> 03:46:03.000
The bold type within the synopsis represents non-town specific elements that may be shared productively between planning committees, communication districts, and boards of different towns.

2194
03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:19.500
It is likely that a study committee will be able to fill in details of how to accomplish this sharing most effectively and bring New Hampshire to a state of universal broadband access.

2195
03:46:19.500 --> 03:46:22.500
I'm going to pause right here.

2196
03:46:22.500 --> 03:46:40.500
I hope that you have this written testimony in front of you because I'd like to refer to the eight steps that municipalities would have to go through in order to acquire broadband under RSA 53G.

2197
03:46:40.500 --> 03:46:55.500
If you look at this list, I'm imagining a local town to me, Salisbury, New Hampshire, with a population of 1,400 whose non-specialist select board is composed of three tradespeople.

2198
03:46:55.500 --> 03:47:13.500
There are 43 homes on North Road that lack broadband access of any kind and additional unserved households as that road crosses into the adjacent towns of Andover and West Franklin, just beyond the Salisbury line.

2199
03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:19.000
These are all the steps that Salisbury would have to follow.

2200
03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:24.500
The select board would have to form an unpaid planning board.

2201
03:47:24.500 --> 03:47:33.000
Two, the planning committee would have to seek private or public funding, seek loans or charge fees.

2202
03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:43.500
Three, the planning committee would have to engage legal counsel, accountants, engineers, contractors, consultants, other advisors, and paying for those expenses.

2203
03:47:43.500 --> 03:48:01.000
And then four, the planning committee will create a communications district, which creates a name and a seal for itself and is empowered to receive money and enter into contracts with ISPs and broadband customers.

2204
03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:09.500
Five, the planning committee creates a governing board, which handles the business affairs of the communication districts.

2205
03:48:09.500 --> 03:48:12.500
And this is an important point.

2206
03:48:12.500 --> 03:48:38.000
That governing board has to create bylaws guiding its municipal members admissions or to or leaving the board and sharing and figuring out how to share those costs and debts even as the board membership changes as towns band together or decide that they want to get out of their agreements.

2207
03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:48.000
Then the planning committee has to research all the suitable types of equipment and prepare cost estimates and citing proposals.

2208
03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:56.500
And then they plan a draft district agreement which they bring to a vote in their town.

2209
03:48:56.500 --> 03:49:06.000
They present it to the Attorney General, revise it if necessary, and then vote on it to enact it.

2210
03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:22.000
Now if you're looking at the at the written testimony part of step 3 and all parts 4, 5, and 6 and part of part 7 are not unique to that town.

2211
03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:54.500
They would have to be repeated by all 233 towns in the state of New Hampshire and what I'm proposing is that a study committee be formed to figure out how that work can be shared in common across the state and so i would like to stop and answer questions if you have any thank you representative michael harrington is recognized hearing a question.

2212
03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:58.000
Representative Harrington, you recognize for a question.

2213
03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:00.000
It's on mute.

2214
03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:02.000
Okay, Representative Somsich.

2215
03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:05.000
Representative Somsich, you recognize our question?

2216
03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:07.500
I'm not hearing a question.

2217
03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:09.500
Yes.

2218
03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:11.500
Yeah, thank you.

2219
03:50:11.500 --> 03:50:13.500
Thank you, Mr.

2220
03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:17.000
Chairman, and thank you, former resident Wells.

2221
03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:29.500
I think you bring up a really good point that, especially now that we're in the pandemic, We know that the former resident at Wells.

2222
03:50:29.500 --> 03:50:43.000
I think you bring up a really good point that especially now that we're in the pandemic, we notice how important this broadband connection is for everybody.

2223
03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:58.500
And the chances are good that this is not going to be the first time we're going to see some type of pandemic or virus affect our state and other places.

2224
03:50:58.500 --> 03:51:08.000
So I think it's really good to think about how to make sure that all residents do get access.

2225
03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:16.500
So my question to you is, this study committee, or this is, yeah, it's a study committee.

2226
03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:25.000
Have you had any contact with organizations or entities that may be involved in making this happen?

2227
03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:41.000
For example, have you talked to the current broadband utilities to see if they would be willing to come to some kind of mutual agreement to fill in the holes between coverage?

2228
03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:44.000
Yes, thank you for that question.

2229
03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:52.500
I have spoken to some of the ISPs in the state, but certainly not all of them.

2230
03:51:52.500 --> 03:52:15.500
One of the difficulties that I've run into is that in this town, Salisbury, near me, the town is cut in half by an old telecom territory border that separates one half of the town is in consolidated jurisdiction and the other half is in TDS.

2231
03:52:15.500 --> 03:52:20.000
TDS, you might be aware, is headquartered in Wisconsin.

2232
03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:31.500
The difficulty is that the territory on the west side of the Merrimack River, which is consolidated, has no fiber service at all.

2233
03:52:31.500 --> 03:52:35.500
Consolidated has not brought fiber across the river.

2234
03:52:35.500 --> 03:52:41.500
And so it would be prohibitively expensive for them to do that.

2235
03:52:41.500 --> 03:52:45.500
And they've proposed a territory swap with TDS.

2236
03:52:45.500 --> 03:52:48.500
TDS has not responded to that.

2237
03:52:48.500 --> 03:53:08.000
I think that it's really important that the state of New Hampshire takes a role in this, because if the state does not take a role, then not all of the stakeholders or ISPs will be included in this.

2238
03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:15.000
And so I think that's very important that the state plays this central role.

2239
03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:32.500
The other reason that the state needs to play a central role is in a worst case scenario, we could end up with a patchwork of independent, incompatible, and obsolescent technologies in every different town.

2240
03:53:32.500 --> 03:53:51.500
And so I think that there really needs to be, the state needs to come in and say, you know, we want broadband and we want it as soon as possible, within the next few months if possible.

2241
03:53:51.500 --> 03:54:00.500
And I think it's going to take statewide organization in order to figure out what the plan is.

2242
03:54:00.500 --> 03:54:23.500
So this is why I think a study committee is a good idea, because we need an entity that's empowered and also broad enough in its scope across the state that it can make decisions and make recommendations on how we should proceed best on this.

2243
03:54:23.500 --> 03:54:25.500
Thank you, Representative Weld.

2244
03:54:25.500 --> 03:54:28.000
Thank you, Representative Michael Harrington.

2245
03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:30.500
Do you have a question?

2246
03:54:30.500 --> 03:54:32.500
Representative Jackie Kelly-Bitz.

2247
03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:34.500
Don't forget to unmute.

2248
03:54:34.500 --> 03:54:38.500
Nice to hear from you again, Representative Wells.

2249
03:54:38.500 --> 03:54:56.000
Are you aware of any of the committees within the state, telecommunications committees and oversight committees, broadband oversight committees that are doing anything currently to bring this together or try to bring the entities together?

2250
03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:06.000
No, I'm not aware that there is any engagement on this under the mechanism that is described in RSA 53G.

2251
03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:09.500
It's very well spelled out, I think.

2252
03:55:09.500 --> 03:55:28.000
But the problem is, it's such an involved process for a small community, because the number of specialists that you need to hire, the amount of money that you have to be able to put up front.

2253
03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:50.000
And I was just talking yesterday to a city councilwoman from Franklin, and I asked her to look at RSA 53 and she said, oh my goodness, this is much more than even a small city can manage to do, never mind a village.

2254
03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:58.000
And we really need, especially from my point of view, I live in a rural district.

2255
03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:10.000
I understand the rural difficulties, and I hope we're going to have a speaker today talking about what the urban aspect of this is.

2256
03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:13.000
But it's everywhere in the state.

2257
03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:21.500
And it's not just that it's a uniformly distributed bunch of people who don't have internet access.

2258
03:56:21.500 --> 03:56:25.000
There are actual blocks Thank you, Ken.

2259
03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:27.000
Thank you.

2260
03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:39.000
I would remind everyone that this is a study committee bill, and so the questions should revolve around why we need a study committee.

2261
03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:41.500
Next up is Representative Pimentel.

2262
03:56:41.500 --> 03:56:43.500
Thank you, Mr.

2263
03:56:43.500 --> 03:56:45.500
Chairman.

2264
03:56:45.500 --> 03:56:47.500
Former Rep.

2265
03:56:47.500 --> 03:56:49.500
Wells.

2266
03:56:49.500 --> 03:56:54.000
This sounds like it's not that different than electricity.

2267
03:56:54.000 --> 03:57:14.500
And I'm wondering if one of the things that they would be looking at is something similar to what we're dealing with with electricity where we have one entity maintaining the distribution system and then the actual services is competitive throughout.

2268
03:57:14.500 --> 03:57:24.000
Yeah, so I think that there are a bunch of different ways you could do this, certainly with electricity.

2269
03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:32.000
You know, this is how we ended up with a public utilities commission and so forth.

2270
03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:51.000
You know, this is very much up to the negotiations with the internet service providers and the state to figure out whether we change the relationship or whether we're able to achieve universal broadband under the current structures.

2271
03:57:51.000 --> 03:58:30.500
But I think it's really critical that we do something very soon because we have one in eight of the children in our schools are not able to equally participate in hybrid classrooms because there's there's not adequate broadband for them to participate in a zoom meeting like this one you know they can they can raise their hand but their their audio or video drops out, or they don't have enough data minutes on their cell phone plan.

2272
03:58:30.500 --> 03:58:32.500
This is not acceptable.

2273
03:58:32.500 --> 03:58:36.500
It's not just our children, it's our seniors.

2274
03:58:36.500 --> 03:58:51.000
There are so many isolated seniors, particularly out in the rural areas here, that they can't Zoom with their families to join a birthday party or these other things.

2275
03:58:51.000 --> 03:59:02.500
And so they're alone and they don't have any way of reaching out the way that we are doing now during the pandemic.

2276
03:59:02.500 --> 03:59:09.500
And so I think this is something we need to deal with very quickly.

2277
03:59:09.500 --> 03:59:27.500
If you look at the bill, it identifies stakeholders, including the ISPs, including experts on broadband, including experts on digital equity and inclusion, including experts on finance and things like that, grant writers and so forth.

2278
03:59:27.500 --> 03:59:41.500
So I'm thinking that this study committee could be a model for the type of entity that would be able to marshal all the resources that communities need.

2279
03:59:41.500 --> 03:59:46.000
Okay, thank you, former Representative Wells, for your testimony.

2280
03:59:46.000 --> 03:59:57.000
We have five other people who would like to testify on this bill, so I will now call on Representative Suzanne Vail.

2281
03:59:57.000 --> 03:59:59.000
Suzanne Vale.

2282
03:59:59.000 --> 04:00:02.500
Representative, you are now able to speak.

2283
04:00:02.500 --> 04:00:04.500
Remember to unmute yourself.

2284
04:00:04.500 --> 04:00:07.000
Can you hear me now?

2285
04:00:07.000 --> 04:00:09.000
Yes, we can.

2286
04:00:09.000 --> 04:00:11.000
Thank you.

2287
04:00:11.000 --> 04:00:13.000
Okay.

2288
04:00:13.000 --> 04:00:15.000
I'm sorry about that.

2289
04:00:15.000 --> 04:00:17.000
Good afternoon, Mr.

2290
04:00:17.000 --> 04:00:19.000
Chairman and honorable colleagues.

2291
04:00:19.000 --> 04:00:27.500
My name is Suzanne Vail, and I'm a state representative from Nashua Ward 3, Hillsborough District 30.

2292
04:00:27.500 --> 04:00:31.500
I rise today in support of the bill.

2293
04:00:31.500 --> 04:00:51.000
As you heard from the Honorable Ken Wells, lack of broadband infrastructure is a statewide problem in isolation and being disconnected occurs in the city even as far as interfering with some, the ability to survive in the home.

2294
04:00:51.000 --> 04:01:02.500
When our schools went to virtual learning in response to the pandemic, cable broadband became available to more students in Nashua Thank you.

2295
04:01:02.500 --> 04:01:06.000
the ability to survive in the home.

2296
04:01:06.000 --> 04:01:19.500
When our schools went to virtual learning in response to the pandemic, cable broadband became available to more students in Nashua under the Comcast Internet Essentials program.

2297
04:01:19.500 --> 04:01:31.000
And that was expanded due to the state of emergency and it brought broadband into a lot of homes for a low price.

2298
04:01:31.000 --> 04:01:39.500
But this level of service and bandwidth is very slow and it doesn't support multiple students simultaneously.

2299
04:01:39.500 --> 04:01:49.500
It's supposed to be a certain rate of megabits and it measures most of the time at 17 or less.

2300
04:01:49.500 --> 04:02:07.000
The speed and the instability is too much for even the rest of the customers in the city who are using the broadband for their entertainment home and the delay is distributed out over everyone.

2301
04:02:07.000 --> 04:02:25.500
We don't have a lot of options in Nashua in terms of broadband as consolidated communications, installed fiber optic service in some parts of our town, but never extended the opportunity to the rest of the city.

2302
04:02:25.500 --> 04:02:43.500
Instead of going into the details about all the things that you need to do, that you need to have a computer in order to do, I will leave that and yield some of my time.

2303
04:02:43.500 --> 04:02:57.000
But I do want to say that our community mental health center and our public health center, our domestic and sexual violence catchment areas served by Nashua.

2304
04:02:57.000 --> 04:03:07.000
We have a lot of obligation out there that we need to keep an eye on people in the community.

2305
04:03:07.000 --> 04:03:13.000
We need to extend the services to them that they're entitled to.

2306
04:03:13.000 --> 04:03:28.000
And we as providers of services and as outreach, people, whether in government or providing human services, we are really severely handicapped from providing the services that we can do.

2307
04:03:28.000 --> 04:03:49.000
And so I just wanted to speak up on the urban impact because it may not be so obvious that the problems we face are similar and different, but we have serious problems just as much as the rest of the state.

2308
04:03:49.000 --> 04:04:09.000
And when it's time to consider a solid and time-tested approach, I urge you to bring us a step closer to installing universal broadband in New Hampshire by forwarding this bill down to the vote for a unanimous floor vote.

2309
04:04:09.000 --> 04:04:11.000
Thank you.

2310
04:04:11.000 --> 04:04:13.000
Thank you, Ms.

2311
04:04:13.000 --> 04:04:15.000
Vail, for your testimony.

2312
04:04:15.000 --> 04:04:19.500
I have Senator Jay Kahn signed up to speak.

2313
04:04:19.500 --> 04:04:23.000
However, I do not see no list.

2314
04:04:23.000 --> 04:04:27.500
People have requested to speak from the attending panel.

2315
04:04:27.500 --> 04:04:34.000
I'll skip over him for now to see if he shows up later.

2316
04:04:34.000 --> 04:04:41.500
And next I will call on Carol Miller, who I have seen on the list.

2317
04:04:41.500 --> 04:04:43.500
And Ms.

2318
04:04:43.500 --> 04:04:47.000
Miller, you are now allowed to speak.

2319
04:04:47.000 --> 04:04:49.000
Thank you.

2320
04:04:49.000 --> 04:04:56.000
Good afternoon, Chairman Vos and the members of the Science, Technology, and Energy Committee.

2321
04:04:56.000 --> 04:05:03.500
I'm providing testimony in support of HB 153, in part, for a couple of reasons.

2322
04:05:03.500 --> 04:05:14.000
You have my written testimony, so I won't spend a whole lot of time going through the usual statements about broadband.

2323
04:05:14.000 --> 04:05:19.000
But I just will introduce myself to new committee members.

2324
04:05:19.000 --> 04:05:26.500
I'm currently serving as Director of Broadband Initiatives for the National Collaborative for Digital Equity.

2325
04:05:26.500 --> 04:05:28.500
Thank you.

2326
04:05:28.500 --> 04:05:31.500
introduce myself to new committee members.

2327
04:05:31.500 --> 04:06:01.500
I'm currently serving as Director of Broadband Initiatives for the National Collaborative for Digital Equity, founded and based in New Hampshire, newly retired on December 31st from state government as the Director of Broadband Technology in the Department of Business and Economic Affairs, and formerly DRED in the Division of Economic Development, combined with over 11 years in state service.

2328
04:06:01.500 --> 04:06:16.500
Previously spent 19 years as Vice President of North Country Internet Access based in Berlin, New Hampshire, and currently speaking from my home in Gorham, New Hampshire, in Cohos County.

2329
04:06:16.500 --> 04:06:26.000
I've spent most of my career helping people connect to the Internet, and, you know, there are gaps everywhere.

2330
04:06:26.000 --> 04:06:31.500
This is not our first time in a study committee bill.

2331
04:06:31.500 --> 04:06:39.000
I conducted the last study committee for a group, I would say, four years ago.

2332
04:06:39.000 --> 04:06:45.000
And I'm supporting this bill not necessarily to create a statewide network.

2333
04:06:45.000 --> 04:06:48.000
It's to bring the partners together.

2334
04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:53.500
I'm supporting this bill, not necessarily to create a statewide network.

2335
04:06:53.500 --> 04:06:56.500
It's to bring the partners together.

2336
04:06:56.500 --> 04:07:11.000
The bill is written in a way that when I listen to what former Representative Wells was talking about, it seems like we're putting the cart before the horse.

2337
04:07:11.000 --> 04:07:16.500
We need to go back through and look at the landscape.

2338
04:07:16.500 --> 04:07:18.500
Look what's happening.

2339
04:07:18.500 --> 04:07:24.500
Who is in a position to be able to move broadband forward?

2340
04:07:24.500 --> 04:07:29.500
The state has never been in the business of broadband.

2341
04:07:29.500 --> 04:07:37.500
In fact, they've been hands-off for the 11 years that I have been in state service.

2342
04:07:37.500 --> 04:07:42.500
There's current legislation introducing establishing a broadband initiative matching fund.

2343
04:07:42.500 --> 04:07:54.000
And I testified this morning that they need to really establish an office of broadband first before they come up with a fund.

2344
04:07:54.000 --> 04:08:01.500
And I think the Office of Strategic Initiatives is the perfect place to do that.

2345
04:08:01.500 --> 04:08:08.000
So there are lots of things swirling around that we don't know about.

2346
04:08:08.000 --> 04:08:21.500
And I think in order for any recommendations to come out of this committee, and I'm more than happy to serve, I think it's a great idea.

2347
04:08:21.500 --> 04:08:32.000
But I don't want to get to the end of a study committee like we did last time and nothing happened.

2348
04:08:32.000 --> 04:08:34.000
Nothing.

2349
04:08:34.000 --> 04:08:36.500
Not a one thing happened.

2350
04:08:36.500 --> 04:08:41.000
It was very disappointing in a number of ways.

2351
04:08:41.000 --> 04:08:45.000
We spent months presentation after presentation from providers.

2352
04:08:45.000 --> 04:08:50.500
At the time, New Hampshire Electric Co-op came in and presented.

2353
04:08:50.500 --> 04:08:54.500
They weren't getting into the business of broadband.

2354
04:08:54.500 --> 04:09:00.500
Today, they've just spent $12 million putting in fiber to the premise.

2355
04:09:00.500 --> 04:09:05.000
So there's a lot going on in the state.

2356
04:09:05.000 --> 04:09:13.000
And I think that it's time that we look at strategies to look to the future.

2357
04:09:13.000 --> 04:09:15.500
Stop worrying about the present.

2358
04:09:15.500 --> 04:09:18.000
We can't fix the present.

2359
04:09:18.000 --> 04:09:22.000
What we can do is fix the future.

2360
04:09:22.000 --> 04:09:24.500
We can future-proof New Hampshire.

2361
04:09:24.500 --> 04:09:29.500
We can do fiber to every premise in the state.

2362
04:09:29.500 --> 04:09:32.500
I don't care who owns it.

2363
04:09:32.500 --> 04:09:42.000
I don't care who manages it, but it should be available to each and every constituent across the state.

2364
04:09:42.000 --> 04:09:51.000
In my testimony, I tell you, historically, business has always been able to secure fiber to the premise.

2365
04:09:51.000 --> 04:09:55.000
It's the residential market that has been ignored.

2366
04:09:55.000 --> 04:10:03.500
And to the fact that it's been allowed to, the old infrastructure has been allowed to deteriorate.

2367
04:10:03.500 --> 04:10:09.000
We need new wire, new fiber, new competition, whatever it takes.

2368
04:10:09.000 --> 04:10:21.500
And I think we have an opportune time now to come up with strategies and embrace the future for the next 50 years to come.

2369
04:10:21.500 --> 04:10:29.500
Stop putting band-aids on a sagging infrastructure and let's look for new infrastructure of the future.

2370
04:10:29.500 --> 04:10:34.500
Providers need capital and partners to expand their fiber nodes.

2371
04:10:34.500 --> 04:10:53.500
In my new role, I'm providing guidance to many initiatives, including investment, collaboration for remote content delivery, and developing models for communities in New Hampshire and nationwide for relieving digital inclusion barriers and expressly promoting implications for policymakers.

2372
04:10:53.500 --> 04:10:56.000
And the time is right.

2373
04:10:56.000 --> 04:10:58.000
Fiber is our future.

2374
04:10:58.000 --> 04:11:10.000
It's a long-range plan, but it's the only one that will deliver the capacity that we need now and for the next 50 years.

2375
04:11:10.000 --> 04:11:22.000
We have a unique opportunity right now to map fiber as it's being deployed and maintain that data for future investments in every community.

2376
04:11:22.000 --> 04:11:26.500
So on that note, I will conclude my testimony.

2377
04:11:26.500 --> 04:11:42.500
And again, I am in support of this bill, but the last thing I think anyone wants to do is spend a lot of time and have nothing come out of it.

2378
04:11:42.500 --> 04:11:50.000
There's some recommendations that need to be looked at and Thank you for that testimony.

2379
04:11:50.000 --> 04:11:53.500
For questions, I see Representative Jackie Calley-Pitts.

2380
04:11:53.500 --> 04:11:55.500
Don't forget to unmute.

2381
04:11:55.500 --> 04:11:57.500
Hi, Carol.

2382
04:11:57.500 --> 04:12:01.000
It's nice to talk to you again.

2383
04:12:01.000 --> 04:12:07.000
Would a committee, could a committee be instrumental in securing federal funds?

2384
04:12:07.000 --> 04:12:21.500
I know that in Washington, there's a Broadband Act of 2020, and I know that the administration is very interested in promulgating broadband and higher up and down speeds.

2385
04:12:21.500 --> 04:12:30.500
So do you think the committee could be instrumental in doing that, in getting funds for the state?

2386
04:12:30.500 --> 04:12:37.000
Well, I think the committee could be instrumental in establishing a broadband office.

2387
04:12:37.000 --> 04:12:45.500
When I retired December 31st, nobody, you can't call anybody in the state and talk about broadband.

2388
04:12:45.500 --> 04:13:04.000
The new legislation is on the broadband matching initiative fund is placing it in the office of strategic initiatives, which I think is great, but there still is nobody in charge of broadband at the state level.

2389
04:13:04.000 --> 04:13:10.500
And I think that's one recommendation that we need to come up with.

2390
04:13:10.500 --> 04:13:14.500
There are advantages to having a broadband office.

2391
04:13:14.500 --> 04:13:29.000
Number one, if you're writing grants, just score higher if you have somebody in state government that is in charge or that understands what's going on in your state.

2392
04:13:29.000 --> 04:13:44.000
That person can also be helpful to the federal delegation in regards to what works for New Hampshire when they're proposing these broadband bills that are so big and large.

2393
04:13:44.000 --> 04:13:53.000
I mean, they look at New Hampshire at the federal level, and they think we're fairly well connected.

2394
04:13:53.000 --> 04:13:58.500
And I guess we are, as opposed to Missouri or Alaska.

2395
04:13:58.500 --> 04:14:01.000
But we still have gaps.

2396
04:14:01.000 --> 04:14:08.500
And we don't have the infrastructure of the future available to each and every resident.

2397
04:14:08.500 --> 04:14:13.000
So there's a lot of work to be done.

2398
04:14:13.000 --> 04:14:28.000
And this committee could start us down the path of actually getting organized with a broadband office, with broadband funds, with strategies that help providers and municipalities, whoever it is.

2399
04:14:28.000 --> 04:14:31.500
We don't care who owns a fiber.

2400
04:14:31.500 --> 04:14:37.500
We just care that it's available and usable and reliable and fast.

2401
04:14:37.500 --> 04:14:45.000
So I hope I've answered your question and it's good to see you as well.

2402
04:14:45.000 --> 04:14:47.000
Thank you.

2403
04:14:47.000 --> 04:14:49.000
Representative Somsich.

2404
04:14:49.000 --> 04:14:51.000
Thank you, Mr.

2405
04:14:51.000 --> 04:14:53.000
Chairman.

2406
04:14:53.000 --> 04:14:55.000
Thank you, Ms.

2407
04:14:55.000 --> 04:14:57.000
Miller.

2408
04:14:57.000 --> 04:15:03.000
So, apparently, from what I've heard, you are basically a broadband warrior.

2409
04:15:03.000 --> 04:15:08.000
But then you also know that New Hampshire likes Band-Aids.

2410
04:15:08.000 --> 04:15:13.500
We use Band-Aids all the time for all kinds of problems.

2411
04:15:13.500 --> 04:15:25.000
So, and you say yourself that you had, you were on the last study committee, and nothing happened as the result of that.

2412
04:15:25.000 --> 04:15:33.500
So while I support this bill and what it's trying to do, I wonder if two things.

2413
04:15:33.500 --> 04:15:42.500
I wonder what you think is the most critical thing that they have to tackle in the beginning.

2414
04:15:42.500 --> 04:15:55.500
And when will you know when you're on a study committee, this study committee, when it's a waste of time and you might as well stop?

2415
04:15:55.500 --> 04:15:59.000
Should you put some certain priorities first?

2416
04:15:59.000 --> 04:16:10.000
And if people aren't willing to go along with that, then you might as well not waste two years of a study.

2417
04:16:10.000 --> 04:16:23.000
So it's not too encouraging what I hear, which has happened historically, but what do you think needs to happen so this is a serious effort?

2418
04:16:23.000 --> 04:16:55.500
Well, I think that the committee needs to look at removing barriers through current legislation that's being proposed that hasn't passed yet, the committee can obviously support that establishing the broadband office with somebody in charge of broadband for the state that can can talk to representatives and senators like yourself and and understand what's happening as opposed to just going off and doing nothing.

2419
04:16:55.500 --> 04:17:06.000
I think what scared the last study committee is we know it's going to take some money to do these things.

2420
04:17:06.000 --> 04:17:08.000
Things don't come cheap.

2421
04:17:08.000 --> 04:17:18.000
I mean, if we want to map New Hampshire for fiber today, we need money to do that and money.

2422
04:17:18.000 --> 04:17:21.000
Everything stops at the money conversation.

2423
04:17:21.000 --> 04:17:31.000
So maybe with strategies and, and some support from all of these initiatives that are happening all across the state.

2424
04:17:31.000 --> 04:17:38.500
Did you know there were three County initiatives looking to do fiber to the premise?

2425
04:17:38.500 --> 04:17:43.000
There's Coas County, there's Carroll County, there's Grafton County.

2426
04:17:43.000 --> 04:17:52.000
The lady from Nashua or the representative from Nashua spoke about how things were rough in her town.

2427
04:17:52.000 --> 04:17:55.000
I mean, the problem is everywhere.

2428
04:17:55.000 --> 04:17:57.000
The capacity is stressed.

2429
04:17:57.000 --> 04:17:59.000
We need more capacity.

2430
04:17:59.000 --> 04:18:07.500
And in order to do that, we need to try collaboratively to remove any barrier we can.

2431
04:18:07.500 --> 04:18:10.500
And the committee can do that.

2432
04:18:10.500 --> 04:18:15.500
I don't think the committee is a waste of time.

2433
04:18:15.500 --> 04:18:21.500
And I don't think the last committee was a waste of time.

2434
04:18:21.500 --> 04:18:24.000
I said I was disappointed.

2435
04:18:24.000 --> 04:18:26.500
There's a big difference there.

2436
04:18:26.500 --> 04:18:30.000
I learned a heck of a lot.

2437
04:18:30.000 --> 04:18:41.000
And you can bet that today, New Hampshire Electric Co-op is in the broadband business because they were hauled into that meeting.

2438
04:18:41.000 --> 04:18:48.500
And all of a sudden, the light bulb went off, and then funding became available.

2439
04:18:48.500 --> 04:18:55.500
So there's a lot to be done from collaboration and talking about these things.

2440
04:18:55.500 --> 04:19:03.000
Low and middle income people don't have the same access to digital hardware or computers.

2441
04:19:03.000 --> 04:19:14.000
We have programs that we've begun in cities like Manchester, Project Lemonade, which is putting devices into hands of these underprivileged families.

2442
04:19:14.000 --> 04:19:41.500
We have programs through some providers that provide, and again, it may not be the right capacity, but maybe with pressure from this committee, we can up the ante and get more capacity for these internet essentials programs, these discounted programs for low and middle income students or families with children in the school system.

2443
04:19:41.500 --> 04:19:47.000
And even for senior citizens, there are programs for senior citizens.

2444
04:19:47.000 --> 04:19:52.500
So with some pressure and some recommendations, we could possibly help.

2445
04:19:52.500 --> 04:20:25.000
But if we don't meet and we don't get together, we don't convene, we don't meet and we don't get together we don't convene we don't collaborate we don't do anything so little steps a long range plan and keep your eye on the future follow up mr chairman yes representative samsich can i just point out before you ask a follow-up question Thank you.

2446
04:20:25.000 --> 04:20:27.000
Follow-up, Mr.

2447
04:20:27.000 --> 04:20:29.000
Chairman?

2448
04:20:29.000 --> 04:20:54.000
Yes, Representative Somsich, can I just point out before you ask a follow-up question that we have two more people who would like to speak on this bill, and then we have an extensive lineup of people who want to speak on the next bill and the bill after that.

2449
04:20:54.000 --> 04:21:01.000
So just keep that in mind as you- I will be very brief, Mr.

2450
04:21:01.000 --> 04:21:03.000
Chairman.

2451
04:21:03.000 --> 04:21:05.000
Okay, thank you.

2452
04:21:05.000 --> 04:21:07.000
Mr.

2453
04:21:07.000 --> 04:21:12.000
Miller, I just wanted to ask, you mentioned the money.

2454
04:21:12.000 --> 04:21:18.500
Do you think that some seed money upfront would be a big incentive?

2455
04:21:18.500 --> 04:21:29.000
I think it would be very helpful if we need to buy intelligence or data or need to help collaborate someone.

2456
04:21:29.000 --> 04:21:50.500
Some seed money up front might do well, and that might do well to go to the Office of Strategic Initiatives, because they're going to need to spend that money and to do mapping and whatever else needs to be done and collaborate.

2457
04:21:50.500 --> 04:21:53.500
And I'll leave my comments there.

2458
04:21:53.500 --> 04:22:00.500
I tend to be long winded, so I will just, I'll stop it there.

2459
04:22:00.500 --> 04:22:02.500
But yeah.

2460
04:22:02.500 --> 04:22:04.500
Okay, Ms.

2461
04:22:04.500 --> 04:22:08.500
Miller, thank you very much for your testimony.

2462
04:22:08.500 --> 04:22:20.000
Next person I have signed up to speak on this bill is Jim Isaac, who was a member of the public representing himself.

2463
04:22:20.000 --> 04:22:26.000
On my list of speakers here, I have someone named Jim I.

2464
04:22:26.000 --> 04:22:34.500
I'm going to take a chance that that's Jim Isaac and allow him to speak to speak.

2465
04:22:34.500 --> 04:22:36.500
Go ahead please.

2466
04:22:36.500 --> 04:22:39.000
Yes, thank you Chairman Voss.

2467
04:22:39.000 --> 04:22:55.500
I also submitted written testimony and given the timing I'm going to let you read that at your leisure and try and address some of the concepts that have come up so far.

2468
04:22:55.500 --> 04:22:58.500
I strongly support the study committee.

2469
04:22:58.500 --> 04:23:14.000
The reasons I'm advocating this have to do with the need to understand what is going on in New Hampshire at the detailed level, that map that has been described here.

2470
04:23:14.000 --> 04:23:28.500
The reality is that we need to take a strategic intent, is the word I would use, to commit to making broadband available to every residence in the state.

2471
04:23:28.500 --> 04:23:37.000
What that means I think we're going to have to understand will vary from area to area.

2472
04:23:37.000 --> 04:23:51.000
So much of my comments really are tied to the idea that we need to understand what works in Nashville and we understand what works in Co-os County.

2473
04:23:51.000 --> 04:23:55.500
In some places it's going to be cable suppliers.

2474
04:23:55.500 --> 04:23:59.500
In some places it may be telephone suppliers.

2475
04:23:59.500 --> 04:24:03.000
In some places it may be satellite.

2476
04:24:03.000 --> 04:24:06.500
In some places it may be municipal.

2477
04:24:06.500 --> 04:24:20.500
All of those are capable of helping us solve the problem, but a statewide understanding of the problem and help in coordinating that effort would be very useful.

2478
04:24:20.500 --> 04:24:27.000
I've seen some the the obstacles in other states that I've worked with.

2479
04:24:27.000 --> 04:24:44.500
The challenge I see for New Hampshire is to develop a commitment to go here and then engage, starting with the local jurisdictions, find out how to make sure they can get what they need.

2480
04:24:44.500 --> 04:25:27.000
And I had not realized the kind of issues that representative Wells had raised earlier that you know interfere with the ability for municipalities to actually make their own decisions here and proceed after them but clearly we need to support them as a state if we're going to have the intent of making broadband available so I'm actually going to stop there and answer questions rather than take up more of your time because you already have the written material in front of you.

2481
04:25:27.000 --> 04:25:29.500
Thank you very much Mr.

2482
04:25:29.500 --> 04:25:31.500
Isaac.

2483
04:25:31.500 --> 04:25:35.000
We appreciate your testimony written and verbal.

2484
04:25:35.000 --> 04:25:44.000
Next up on the list of testifiers is our last speaker of the day and that's Mara Weston.

2485
04:25:44.000 --> 04:25:48.500
She represents the New England Cable and Telecommunications Association.

2486
04:25:48.500 --> 04:25:59.500
NECTA is a five-state regional trade association representing substantially all private cable providers in New Hampshire, including Atlantic Broadband, Charter, and Comcast.

2487
04:25:59.500 --> 04:26:08.000
Our members serve 104 New Hampshire municipalities with broadband, video, voice, wireless, home security, and automation services.

2488
04:26:08.000 --> 04:26:21.500
Over the past decade, our members have collectively invested over a billion dollars developing state-of-the-art networks in New Hampshire to service our now more than 450,000 customers.

2489
04:26:21.500 --> 04:26:28.500
I thank you for the opportunity to provide comments today on House Bill 153.

2490
04:26:28.500 --> 04:26:47.500
I have submitted written testimony with a significant amount of information about the work our members are doing to provide high-speed broadband and the unprecedented steps they have taken to keep Granite Staters connected, particularly through this pandemic.

2491
04:26:47.500 --> 04:27:05.000
As the sponsor said, this pandemic has certainly made clear to all of us the importance of high-speed internet for those of us who work in school from home and want to connect with family.

2492
04:27:05.000 --> 04:27:17.500
And our broadband providers, our members, are taking proactive steps to ensure that families and students are not only connected, but that they stay connected.

2493
04:27:17.500 --> 04:27:24.500
We have pledged not to terminate service for customers unable to pay their bills.

2494
04:27:24.500 --> 04:27:39.000
We have waived late fees, opened up tens of thousands of free Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the state, invested millions of dollars in programs to help low-income individuals get connected.

2495
04:27:39.000 --> 04:27:43.500
And we've partnered with municipalities and schools Thank you.

2496
04:27:43.500 --> 04:28:04.000
thousands of free Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the state, invested millions of dollars in programs to help low-income individuals get connected, and we've partnered with municipalities and schools to provide subsidized high-speed internet service at no cost to students or their families.

2497
04:28:04.000 --> 04:28:19.000
Although NECDA doesn't oppose a study commission or other efforts that thoughtfully address the issue of broadband access, we urge the committee to consider a few points in your deliberations.

2498
04:28:19.000 --> 04:28:28.500
First, it is absolutely crucial to have an accurate understanding of the state of deployment and the efforts underway.

2499
04:28:28.500 --> 04:28:31.000
This is a critical foundation.

2500
04:28:31.000 --> 04:28:34.500
We need a common set of facts.

2501
04:28:34.500 --> 04:28:48.000
For example, cable has deployed gigabit service throughout 184 towns and cities in New Hampshire, bringing the state-of-the-art service to, as I said, more than 450,000 customers.

2502
04:28:48.000 --> 04:28:59.500
Our deployment, along with that of the rest of the wired industry, has brought broadband speeds to more than 95% of the state.

2503
04:28:59.500 --> 04:29:07.000
The issue really before us is how to bring broadband to a remaining small percentage.

2504
04:29:07.000 --> 04:29:21.000
The findings in this bill seem to reflect perceived needs, but not necessarily the actual state of broadband, nor does it clearly articulate a problem to be addressed.

2505
04:29:21.000 --> 04:29:31.000
Should the committee determine that a commission is worthwhile, NECTA urges this committee to amend the composition of the commission.

2506
04:29:31.000 --> 04:29:43.000
As currently formed, there is one industry voice on a 13-member commission, which is truly inadequate to reflect the importance and contributions of stakeholders.

2507
04:29:43.000 --> 04:29:54.000
The Broadband industry is comprised of a diverse set of companies deploying different technologies and solutions to meet all their customers' needs.

2508
04:29:54.000 --> 04:30:05.000
Any commission should include representation from members of the cable industry, iLEC telephone, RLEC telephone, CLEX, wireless, fixed wireless, and satellite industries.

2509
04:30:05.000 --> 04:30:13.500
These companies are already solving the problem of broadband availability and are critical to a successful commission.

2510
04:30:13.500 --> 04:30:23.500
We need the right people and the right focus on the right issues if a commission is to be successful.

2511
04:30:23.500 --> 04:30:28.000
And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions.

2512
04:30:28.000 --> 04:30:39.500
If a commission were to move forward, we would look forward to to working with it and hopefully have an opportunity to participate.

2513
04:30:39.500 --> 04:30:42.000
Thank you for your consideration.

2514
04:30:42.000 --> 04:30:44.000
Thank you, Weston.

2515
04:30:44.000 --> 04:30:46.000
I do have one.

2516
04:30:46.000 --> 04:30:54.500
Are you doing work on any provision in this bill if we were to retain this bill?

2517
04:30:54.500 --> 04:30:57.500
Representative Thomas, we can't hear you.

2518
04:30:57.500 --> 04:30:59.500
We couldn't see that.

2519
04:30:59.500 --> 04:31:02.000
We need to have Mr.

2520
04:31:02.000 --> 04:31:04.000
Isaac mute.

2521
04:31:04.000 --> 04:31:08.000
I don't think I'm unmuted, but I can't.

2522
04:31:08.000 --> 04:31:10.000
Oh, maybe I can.

2523
04:31:10.000 --> 04:31:14.500
You need to mute this because she's getting feedback.

2524
04:31:14.500 --> 04:31:17.000
Didn't solve the problem, unfortunately.

2525
04:31:17.000 --> 04:31:20.500
Are you unmuted now or on summer?

2526
04:31:20.500 --> 04:31:22.500
Are you muted?

2527
04:31:22.500 --> 04:31:24.500
You did now.

2528
04:31:24.500 --> 04:31:26.500
It's on strider now.

2529
04:31:26.500 --> 04:31:30.000
I'll just restate my question to Ms.

2530
04:31:30.000 --> 04:31:32.000
Weston.

2531
04:31:32.000 --> 04:31:44.500
Are you willing to work if this bill would be retained on perhaps revising some words to better approach the situations that you're speaking about?

2532
04:31:44.500 --> 04:31:46.500
Yes, absolutely.

2533
04:31:46.500 --> 04:31:53.500
My clients and I would be happy to work with the committee on that.

2534
04:31:53.500 --> 04:31:57.500
Sorry for the quick change of personnel there.

2535
04:31:57.500 --> 04:32:02.500
We have almost reached the end of this public hearing.

2536
04:32:02.500 --> 04:32:06.000
Are there any outstanding questions for Ms.

2537
04:32:06.000 --> 04:32:08.000
Weston from the committee?

2538
04:32:08.000 --> 04:32:10.000
Seeing none.

2539
04:32:10.000 --> 04:32:12.500
Thank you for the opportunity.

2540
04:32:12.500 --> 04:32:17.000
I actually do see a couple of hands raised.

2541
04:32:17.000 --> 04:32:19.000
Okay, sure enough.

2542
04:32:19.000 --> 04:32:23.000
Representative Bernardi, you are recognized for a question.

2543
04:32:23.000 --> 04:32:25.500
Thank you for the opportunity.

2544
04:32:25.500 --> 04:32:30.000
I actually do see a couple of hands raised.

2545
04:32:30.000 --> 04:32:32.000
Okay, sure enough.

2546
04:32:32.000 --> 04:32:36.000
Representative Bernardi, you are recognized for a question.

2547
04:32:36.000 --> 04:32:42.000
Yes, you made the point we need a common set of facts.

2548
04:32:42.000 --> 04:32:48.000
And I think one of the goals of this is universal broadband.

2549
04:32:48.000 --> 04:33:01.000
But I think one thing that needs to be considered or you need proper facts on this, there may be some folks that don't want broadband.

2550
04:33:01.000 --> 04:33:04.500
There are many elderly want their telephone.

2551
04:33:04.500 --> 04:33:07.500
They don't want a flip phone.

2552
04:33:07.500 --> 04:33:11.500
They don't want any other kind of phone.

2553
04:33:11.500 --> 04:33:14.000
They don't want a computer.

2554
04:33:14.000 --> 04:33:19.500
They don't want anything to do with this kind of technology.

2555
04:33:19.500 --> 04:33:31.000
That has to be part of the consideration of what you're going to do in these communities, both rural as well as urban.

2556
04:33:31.000 --> 04:33:34.000
I absolutely agree with you, Representative.

2557
04:33:34.000 --> 04:33:44.000
In fact, there are probably more people in the state who have access to broadband than have computers or smartphones.

2558
04:33:44.000 --> 04:33:46.500
Adoption is a significant issue.

2559
04:33:46.500 --> 04:33:54.000
Even though people may have access to the service, they choose not to take it.

2560
04:33:54.000 --> 04:34:01.500
And that is a significant issue when my clients look at building out as well.

2561
04:34:01.500 --> 04:34:05.500
So that's an important part of the conversation.

2562
04:34:05.500 --> 04:34:08.000
You raise a good point.

2563
04:34:08.000 --> 04:34:10.000
Thank you.

2564
04:34:10.000 --> 04:34:13.000
Representative Closier, you have a question.

2565
04:34:13.000 --> 04:34:15.000
Thank you, Mr.

2566
04:34:15.000 --> 04:34:17.000
Chair.

2567
04:34:17.000 --> 04:34:19.000
Thank you, Ms.

2568
04:34:19.000 --> 04:34:21.000
Weston, for your testimony.

2569
04:34:21.000 --> 04:34:27.000
I'm going to work off this to represent or not this comment.

2570
04:34:27.000 --> 04:34:30.000
In my family, we have internet.

2571
04:34:30.000 --> 04:34:37.000
I did not do research internet broadband I don't even know what we have.

2572
04:34:37.000 --> 04:34:40.000
It was quite well and enough.

2573
04:34:40.000 --> 04:34:43.000
I got a question coming up.

2574
04:34:43.000 --> 04:35:26.000
Now that our children's also live with us now that the grandchildren are out of school, I have been shut down many times because it incapacitated not enough internet my question to you is would this affect the costs that representative bernardi mentioned to people like me who other than this pandemic i don't need it i don't want it and i don't want to, and I don't want it to occur at a cost of either to others that broadband might push onto regular internet.

2575
04:35:26.000 --> 04:35:33.000
Would you have a way of making sure that might be taken into consideration?

2576
04:35:33.000 --> 04:35:35.000
Thank you, Mr.

2577
04:35:35.000 --> 04:35:37.000
Chairman.

2578
04:35:37.000 --> 04:35:39.000
Sure.

2579
04:35:39.000 --> 04:35:46.000
Let me try to respond to your question, and hopefully I'm understanding it correctly.

2580
04:35:46.000 --> 04:35:58.500
The first comment that I would make is that taxpayer-subsidized broadband spreads the cost to all, regardless of whether or not they want the service.

2581
04:35:58.500 --> 04:36:01.000
For example, a municipal network.

2582
04:36:01.000 --> 04:36:10.000
So I think, one, you know, a note of caution there as municipalities invest taxpayer dollars in networks.

2583
04:36:10.000 --> 04:36:25.000
Two, my clients have offered services at very much discounted rates through the pandemic and have worked with families to try to address their needs at the lowest cost solution.

2584
04:36:25.000 --> 04:36:31.000
In terms of capacity, we are deploying gigabyte service throughout our footprint.

2585
04:36:31.000 --> 04:36:37.500
And so there is availability for what you might need during this pandemic.

2586
04:36:37.500 --> 04:36:47.000
I'm a working mother and my husband's working from home and I have two kids who are remote schooling.

2587
04:36:47.000 --> 04:36:55.500
So I understand full well, you know, having multiple people on multiple Zooms at the same time.

2588
04:36:55.500 --> 04:37:12.500
So capacity is something that you can consider for the short term and then, you know, work with the company to obtain a different package when those needs are not, are no longer necessary.

2589
04:37:12.500 --> 04:37:24.000
So, So, you know, there are a few points there, and I hope that that helps to address your overall concerns and questions.

2590
04:37:24.000 --> 04:37:26.000
Okay, thank you, President.

2591
04:37:26.000 --> 04:37:28.000
Thank you.

2592
04:37:28.000 --> 04:37:34.000
With that testimony, we're going to have to close this public hearing.

2593
04:37:34.000 --> 04:38:00.500
will representative votes i'm sorry for um interrupting it looks like a mr epfelberg has his hand up in the attendees list and he reached out to our office indicating that he'd like to testify well unfortunately we are out of time and have to move on next i'll give him two minutes.

2594
04:38:00.500 --> 04:38:02.500
So, Mr.

2595
04:38:02.500 --> 04:38:05.000
Apleberg, you have two minutes.

2596
04:38:05.000 --> 04:38:07.000
Please go ahead.

2597
04:38:07.000 --> 04:38:09.500
Yes, thank you, Chairman Vos.

2598
04:38:09.500 --> 04:38:11.500
And I apologize.

2599
04:38:11.500 --> 04:38:13.500
I'm not sure why.

2600
04:38:13.500 --> 04:38:16.000
I had registered to testify.

2601
04:38:16.000 --> 04:38:21.500
I'm not sure why that didn't go through on the site.

2602
04:38:21.500 --> 04:38:26.500
But in any case, I will not take two minutes.

2603
04:38:26.500 --> 04:38:29.000
My name is Michael Affelberg.

2604
04:38:29.000 --> 04:38:40.500
I'm the president of the United Way of Greater Nashua, and I would like to speak in favor of establishing this study committee.

2605
04:38:40.500 --> 04:38:50.000
Earlier on, it was discussed the needs of the rural parts of the state with regards to broadband access.

2606
04:38:50.000 --> 04:38:52.000
Absolutely understand that.

2607
04:38:52.000 --> 04:39:11.000
In our community, since the beginning of the pandemic, our efforts have been to provide wireless or internet access to inner city students and their families who just frankly did not have it because they couldn't afford it.

2608
04:39:11.000 --> 04:39:23.500
Even at the level of something like Comcast's internet essentials program, which is only $10 a month, it does come with some barriers for registration.

2609
04:39:23.500 --> 04:39:29.000
So we've been distributing Wi-Fi hotspots at some fairly significant expense.

2610
04:39:29.000 --> 04:39:43.500
We've had over 400 families reach out to us for that service and have connected thus far over 800 students to the internet as a result of that initiative.

2611
04:39:43.500 --> 04:39:50.500
That is not a function of not having an area that has no broadband.

2612
04:39:50.500 --> 04:39:57.000
That's a function of being in an area that has no affordable broadband.

2613
04:39:57.000 --> 04:40:03.500
And I would encourage the study committee to take that seriously into account.

2614
04:40:03.500 --> 04:40:15.000
We need to look at some way to connect kids and families to the internet, even in places where it does already exist.

2615
04:40:15.000 --> 04:40:19.500
And that is all that I had to offer.

2616
04:40:19.500 --> 04:40:31.500
But I did want to say we really appreciate this effort and would support a study committee and any input that we can give.

2617
04:40:31.500 --> 04:40:33.500
Thank you, Mr.

2618
04:40:33.500 --> 04:40:35.500
Apsberg.

2619
04:40:35.500 --> 04:40:42.000
You did a great job and finished in a minute and 30 seconds.

2620
04:40:42.000 --> 04:40:44.000
Thank you very much.

2621
04:40:44.000 --> 04:40:51.000
And I apologize to you that your earlier registration did not somehow get through.

2622
04:40:51.000 --> 04:40:56.000
I guess it just proves that technology is not perfect.

2623
04:40:56.000 --> 04:41:01.000
We will now close the public hearing on HB 153.

2624
04:41:01.000 --> 04:41:10.500
I will report that the blue sheet chose 23 people in support of the bill, zero opposed the bill.

2625
04:41:10.500 --> 04:41:21.000
And with that, we'll declare that bill closed, that public hearing closed, and we'll open the public hearing on HB 119.

2626
04:41:21.000 --> 04:41:24.500
I will ask the time sponsor, Mr.

2627
04:41:24.500 --> 04:41:28.000
Representative John Mann, to introduce the bill.

2628
04:41:28.000 --> 04:41:30.000
Thank you, Mr.

2629
04:41:30.000 --> 04:41:32.000
Chairman.

2630
04:41:32.000 --> 04:41:34.000
House Bill 119.

2631
04:41:34.000 --> 04:41:46.000
FN just deletes a kind of messy situation that had come up a few years ago with the legislation about funding for energy efficiency.

2632
04:41:46.000 --> 04:42:04.000
Funding for energy efficiency has been for years been funded by the system's benefits charge which is part of your electric bill and the PUC initiated a project called EERS or energy efficiency resource standard Standard.

2633
04:42:04.000 --> 04:42:19.000
And when that came up, this bill soon followed, which said the purpose was to say that the legislature would have to approve any increase in the system's benefits charge.

2634
04:42:19.000 --> 04:42:38.000
So that was, and that was not justified on any discussion about whether the PUC or the legislature were more capable of doing a good job or had the understanding to govern the issues related to energy efficiency.

2635
04:42:38.000 --> 04:42:42.500
It was all about whether the Constitution allowed it.

2636
04:42:42.500 --> 04:42:49.000
There was a mistaken reading of the Constitution that was behind the bill.

2637
04:42:49.000 --> 04:42:51.000
Bill.

2638
04:42:51.000 --> 04:42:54.500
And so somehow that got in there.

2639
04:42:54.500 --> 04:43:06.000
And that reading basically said that no increase in the system systems benefit charge can be done without prior approval of the legislature.

2640
04:43:06.000 --> 04:43:23.500
Senator Bradley, seeing EERS getting underway, put an additional change in a subsequent change to the language to the effect that postponing this requirement of legislative approval until after the first EERS project got finished.

2641
04:43:23.500 --> 04:43:40.500
So I just deleted the the original erroneous change and also deleted the now unnecessary addition by Senator Bradley and restored the language to what it had been before the interference with the EERS.

2642
04:43:40.500 --> 04:43:43.500
So that is essentially the bill.

2643
04:43:43.500 --> 04:44:01.500
There hasn't been any real debate about whether the PUC or the legislature is more qualified to run the system's benefits charge or make judgments about how to run, how to pay for the energy efficiency.

2644
04:44:01.500 --> 04:44:08.000
It was simply an act done and at this point an act deleted.

2645
04:44:08.000 --> 04:44:24.000
I will say that we're way behind neighboring states in our energy efficiency work and interference with the Public Utilities Commission in their work on EERS is not going to be helpful.

2646
04:44:24.000 --> 04:44:35.000
I looked at my electric bills from 2016 and 2020, that's only four years, and computed the difference in the transmission charge.

2647
04:44:35.000 --> 04:44:48.000
And as you know, the transmission charge kind of reflects how much electricity we demand in this state relative to the other states in the region.

2648
04:44:48.000 --> 04:44:56.000
And in that four-year period, the per kilowatt hour transmission rate doubled, which is really surprising.

2649
04:44:56.000 --> 04:45:09.500
It seems to me the other states in New England must have done an awfully good job on energy efficiency in order to have that result occur.

2650
04:45:09.500 --> 04:45:17.500
And it is true that all of our surrounding states do have robust energy efficiency programs.

2651
04:45:17.500 --> 04:45:33.000
I've been at meetings where people, where one case, a presentation was given called a report from the donut and the donut represented Massachusetts, Maine Maine and Vermont, our surrounding states.

2652
04:45:33.000 --> 04:45:38.000
And the joke was that New Hampshire was the hole.

2653
04:45:38.000 --> 04:45:48.000
In another meeting more years ago, I heard one person laugh and say, well, there's plenty of work in Massachusetts.

2654
04:45:48.000 --> 04:45:59.500
So that in a sense, we have been kind of somehow not doing, certainly not doing what's possible in the energy efficiency field.

2655
04:45:59.500 --> 04:46:22.500
So in a sense, my motivation to this, putting in this bill was not just to correct the the error made a few years ago, but also to get some funding released so we can actually pursue energy efficiency and with all the benefits it has.

2656
04:46:22.500 --> 04:46:25.500
I'm very experienced in energy efficiency.

2657
04:46:25.500 --> 04:46:29.000
I have an extremely energy efficient house.

2658
04:46:29.000 --> 04:46:34.000
I've done some very significant work in my town buildings.

2659
04:46:34.000 --> 04:46:37.000
I know what it can do.

2660
04:46:37.000 --> 04:46:44.000
The difference you can make is amazing and sometimes the work is quite simple.

2661
04:46:44.000 --> 04:46:51.500
And but you do need a good program and it needs to be done forcefully.

2662
04:46:51.500 --> 04:46:57.000
So that's the end of my presentation on House Bill 119.

2663
04:46:57.000 --> 04:47:08.500
Oh, I wanted to add, excuse me, I wanted to add, and I've said this before, so I just wanted to repeat it.

2664
04:47:08.500 --> 04:47:20.500
If you look at, if you have an aggressive energy efficiency program, the amount of of money that gets saved accumulates, you know, constantly.

2665
04:47:20.500 --> 04:47:36.500
Because, you know, what the work you did 25 years ago has been producing 25 times as much as what a benefit and savings that you can get done in one year.

2666
04:47:36.500 --> 04:47:56.500
What you did 24 years old, 24 times and so on, that adds up to a huge amount of savings and that big chunk of money, that triangle, either goes to our own people or goes to the oil companies.

2667
04:47:56.500 --> 04:47:59.500
And we need to get started.

2668
04:47:59.500 --> 04:48:01.500
Thank you, Mr.

2669
04:48:01.500 --> 04:48:03.500
Chairman.

2670
04:48:03.500 --> 04:48:05.500
Thank you, Representative.

2671
04:48:05.500 --> 04:48:07.500
Representative.

2672
04:48:07.500 --> 04:48:09.500
Thank you, Representative.

2673
04:48:09.500 --> 04:48:11.500
Representative Somsich is right.

2674
04:48:11.500 --> 04:48:15.500
I just want to ask you a question.

2675
04:48:15.500 --> 04:48:17.500
Thank you, Mr.

2676
04:48:17.500 --> 04:48:22.000
Chairman, and thank you, Representative Mann, for your bill.

2677
04:48:22.000 --> 04:48:32.000
I'd like to know, is the systems benefits charts the source of the funding for the New Hampshire Saves program?

2678
04:48:32.000 --> 04:48:38.000
Well, I think New Hampshire Saves is complicated because it's a brand.

2679
04:48:38.000 --> 04:48:41.500
I don't know that it's a program.

2680
04:48:41.500 --> 04:48:45.500
It might be a brand for several programs.

2681
04:48:45.500 --> 04:49:01.000
It could, I would, I suspect it's, New Hampshire saves is a combination of what, what the RGGI funding provides, as well as what the systems benefit charge would be funding.

2682
04:49:01.000 --> 04:49:08.500
In other words, NH saves will be the brand name, even with EERS, for example.

2683
04:49:08.500 --> 04:49:10.500
Follow up, Mr.

2684
04:49:10.500 --> 04:49:12.500
Chair.

2685
04:49:12.500 --> 04:49:14.500
Yes, follow up.

2686
04:49:14.500 --> 04:49:18.500
Also, Representative, thank you for taking my question.

2687
04:49:18.500 --> 04:49:29.000
And do you have any idea of how many low income households in this state are waiting for energy efficiency measures?

2688
04:49:29.000 --> 04:49:38.000
I mean, whether the numbers or what the waiting list is, how many years people have to wait?

2689
04:49:38.000 --> 04:49:41.500
No, I have no ideas about that.

2690
04:49:41.500 --> 04:50:00.000
I did ask once why there wasn't more advertising for NH saves and one of the reps from one of the employees of LeverSource says, well, if we advertise, we run out of money in a month.

2691
04:50:00.000 --> 04:50:02.000
So they don't advertise.

2692
04:50:02.000 --> 04:50:05.500
Don't expect it as a whole lot.

2693
04:50:05.500 --> 04:50:14.000
And again, it's not as if there's no one capable of doing that work in New Hampshire.

2694
04:50:14.000 --> 04:50:18.000
They're all working in Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts.

2695
04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:20.000
Thank you very much.

2696
04:50:20.000 --> 04:50:23.000
Thank you, Representative, for the question.

2697
04:50:23.000 --> 04:50:25.500
I have a question myself.

2698
04:50:25.500 --> 04:50:47.500
Representative Mann, I've heard you talk many times before about the wonderful benefits of energy efficiency, and I'm wondering if energy efficiency is so beneficial to so many people, then why aren't those people going out and spending their own money to buy renovations?

2699
04:50:47.500 --> 04:50:50.000
Yeah, that's a good question.

2700
04:50:50.000 --> 04:50:52.500
Let me think about that.

2701
04:50:52.500 --> 04:50:55.000
The cost is not insignificant.

2702
04:50:55.000 --> 04:50:57.000
I don't know.

2703
04:50:57.000 --> 04:51:06.500
I mean, Massachusetts basically used incentives in a sense that my daughter's house was in a low income area.

2704
04:51:06.500 --> 04:51:20.000
And I don't know what kind of low income area, but the person I called said, well, you qualify after I gave my address, my daughter's address.

2705
04:51:20.000 --> 04:51:42.500
And she got 75% paid by the state and seven years at zero percent to pay back her remaining portion so that is very proactive work by Massachusetts and you know on bill financing is another way to deal with it, deal with the cost.

2706
04:51:42.500 --> 04:51:55.500
As a follow-up, do you think it's possible that people don't spend money on energy efficiency because they choose to spend their money in other ways?

2707
04:51:55.500 --> 04:52:01.500
Well, you know, technically or in terms of the verbal logic, absolutely.

2708
04:52:01.500 --> 04:52:09.000
But I think the reason to use energy efficiency again is that it creates wealth.

2709
04:52:09.000 --> 04:52:23.000
I think the first of all, it creates jobs, plenty of jobs, and good jobs for people that are working with their hands that don't have college degrees.

2710
04:52:23.000 --> 04:52:26.500
It leaves more money in the economy.

2711
04:52:26.500 --> 04:52:33.000
And again, as I said before, this added wealth in the economy accelerates.

2712
04:52:33.000 --> 04:52:35.000
It's a huge thing.

2713
04:52:35.000 --> 04:52:38.500
Massachusetts is way, way ahead of us.

2714
04:52:38.500 --> 04:52:54.000
And the fact that we pay twice as much for transmission and we're this tiny state with all the industry that's happening in Massachusetts, in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and so on.

2715
04:52:54.000 --> 04:52:56.000
It's amazing.

2716
04:52:56.000 --> 04:53:13.000
I just sort of discovered this transmission charge thing, but I haven't sort of turned it into an analysis of exactly what the ratio of our consumption of electric power compared to others is.

2717
04:53:13.000 --> 04:53:20.500
But I think you do need incentives and you do need to have a program.

2718
04:53:20.500 --> 04:53:38.500
The reason to have a program partly is that people want to know that they have a competent and well overseen program, so they're not going to get some hacker making a mess of their house.

2719
04:53:38.500 --> 04:53:42.000
That's why state programs are so good.

2720
04:53:42.000 --> 04:53:55.500
This is going to be so much on energy efficiency and obtaining benefits from saying, why do you believe that Massachusetts electricity costs 20% more than it?

2721
04:53:55.500 --> 04:53:59.000
Probably to pay for the energy efficiency.

2722
04:53:59.000 --> 04:54:04.500
But if they use 20% less, it's not a bad deal.

2723
04:54:04.500 --> 04:54:08.000
Representative Holmell is recognized for a question.

2724
04:54:08.000 --> 04:54:10.000
Yes, Chair.

2725
04:54:10.000 --> 04:54:12.000
Thank you very much.

2726
04:54:12.000 --> 04:54:16.000
Representative Mann, thank you for taking my question.

2727
04:54:16.000 --> 04:54:24.500
The question I do have is, can you tell me what the system benefits charge funds exactly?

2728
04:54:24.500 --> 04:54:26.500
I'm sorry?

2729
04:54:26.500 --> 04:54:28.500
Yes, sir.

2730
04:54:28.500 --> 04:54:34.000
Can you tell me what the system benefits charge funds exactly?

2731
04:54:34.000 --> 04:54:36.000
What does it fund?

2732
04:54:36.000 --> 04:54:38.000
I don't know exactly.

2733
04:54:38.000 --> 04:54:44.000
The intention is that it'll be funding the energy efficiency programs though.

2734
04:54:44.000 --> 04:54:47.500
I don't know what else it funds.

2735
04:54:47.500 --> 04:54:53.000
I think it may fund some right now, some energy efficiency.

2736
04:54:53.000 --> 04:54:55.000
Okay.

2737
04:54:55.000 --> 04:55:11.000
The question I have is if we don't know exactly what it funds or if it's not clarified, why would we give the PUC authority to alter this instead of the legislature?

2738
04:55:11.000 --> 04:55:14.500
Because the PUC is running these programs.

2739
04:55:14.500 --> 04:55:25.000
I guess maybe what would be useful would be a presentation about what's going on with the energy efficiency resource standard.

2740
04:55:25.000 --> 04:55:31.500
It's a major project in terms of organizing a statewide energy efficiency program.

2741
04:55:31.500 --> 04:55:37.500
And it's kind of we're getting off the dime, you know, essentially.

2742
04:55:37.500 --> 04:55:42.000
But I don't know the answer to your question.

2743
04:55:42.000 --> 04:55:50.000
I think there are some low income efforts and there are some that are federally funded.

2744
04:55:50.000 --> 04:55:56.500
And I don't have a very detailed picture of exactly what's being done.

2745
04:55:56.500 --> 04:55:59.500
You you need another follow-up, Representative?

2746
04:55:59.500 --> 04:56:01.500
No, no, sir.

2747
04:56:01.500 --> 04:56:09.500
I was just commenting that I don't think we were getting off the dime on this.

2748
04:56:09.500 --> 04:56:13.500
I think that's the whole point of this.

2749
04:56:13.500 --> 04:56:23.500
What's being proposed is to change the authority to change the system benefit chart from the legislature to the CDC.

2750
04:56:23.500 --> 04:56:29.500
So I just wanted to comment that that's precisely all the dime.

2751
04:56:29.500 --> 04:56:31.500
Okay.

2752
04:56:31.500 --> 04:56:34.500
Representative Ploge, you had a question?

2753
04:56:34.500 --> 04:56:36.500
Thank you, Mr.

2754
04:56:36.500 --> 04:56:38.500
Chair.

2755
04:56:38.500 --> 04:56:41.500
Yes, thank you for your testimony.

2756
04:56:41.500 --> 04:57:10.000
To follow up, Representative Malawas, the way I see it is the legislature It sets the cost benefit charge and at one time or it still does now it needs it it's the legislator that needs to raise it and this bill takes that away so right now if there was a rate increase, am I correct?

2757
04:57:10.000 --> 04:57:21.000
A system charge increase, according to this bill, the voters would have no, the TCU would have no accountability to the voters.

2758
04:57:21.000 --> 04:57:25.500
They weren't elected as bureaucrats making increases in charges.

2759
04:57:25.500 --> 04:57:27.500
No longer just checking.

2760
04:57:27.500 --> 04:57:29.500
Am I correct?

2761
04:57:29.500 --> 04:57:32.500
No, I don't think you're correct.

2762
04:57:32.500 --> 04:57:41.500
First of all, the voters would hold the legislature responsible if there was excessive money or they thought.

2763
04:57:41.500 --> 04:57:46.000
I mean, that's the legislature has an oversight responsibility.

2764
04:57:46.000 --> 04:58:03.000
But I think trying to run the details of any part, any program in the state, I mean, our entire administrative state is running on their own, basically with legislative oversight and legislative policy.

2765
04:58:03.000 --> 04:58:05.500
Thank you for the explanation.

2766
04:58:05.500 --> 04:58:22.000
I want to read more so I better understand, unless you can explain it out where the legislators sets the rate for system benefits, but this bill allows the DUC to increase it?

2767
04:58:22.000 --> 04:58:25.000
I think the PUC said it.

2768
04:58:25.000 --> 04:58:30.500
We might wanna hear from somebody with the Public Utilities Commission.

2769
04:58:30.500 --> 04:58:37.000
I'm quite sure that what the legislature has is oversight, not setting rates.

2770
04:58:37.000 --> 04:58:39.000
Thank you.

2771
04:58:39.000 --> 04:58:42.000
Okay, next up is representative Crecian.

2772
04:58:42.000 --> 04:58:44.000
Sorry, my mistake.

2773
04:58:44.000 --> 04:58:48.500
I did not mean to have my head raised.

2774
04:58:48.500 --> 04:58:51.500
Okay, next up is representative Vox.

2775
04:58:51.500 --> 04:58:53.500
Thank you very much.

2776
04:58:53.500 --> 04:59:10.000
It's my understanding that Mike Fitzgerald from DES is on the line who is proficient in these issues and we should be asking him these questions rather than the sponsor of the bill.

2777
04:59:10.000 --> 04:59:42.000
Could we possibly ask, we often have done this in the past to have agency personnel when when we don't have the answers i second the motion i second it i think that's a great idea sorry and you'll have to help us here if we have somebody on the phone how do we get them into this meeting is there a phone number?

2778
04:59:42.000 --> 04:59:45.500
I don't see anything on my screen.

2779
04:59:45.500 --> 04:59:48.500
I'm not even seeing him now.

2780
04:59:48.500 --> 04:59:51.500
He might have been called away.

2781
04:59:51.500 --> 04:59:54.000
We also have Madeline Minow.

2782
04:59:54.000 --> 04:59:57.500
I don't see Karen Crampton here either.

2783
04:59:57.500 --> 05:00:00.500
John Kreese is waiting as well.

2784
05:00:00.500 --> 05:00:03.500
She'll be speaking after Representative Land.

2785
05:00:03.500 --> 05:00:05.500
She's obviously sure.

2786
05:00:05.500 --> 05:00:17.000
Barring having the professionals here, if I might just remind people what's in the 10-year energy strategy, could I do that Chair Post?

2787
05:00:17.000 --> 05:00:20.500
You have a question to ask Mr.

2788
05:00:20.500 --> 05:00:22.500
Manning?

2789
05:00:22.500 --> 05:00:42.500
The question was asked earlier as to what the system benefits charge is and what it covers, and I think that there are answers in this document, but there are also policy directives that come out of the governor's office.

2790
05:00:42.500 --> 05:00:46.000
The legislation describes the system's benefits charge.

2791
05:00:46.000 --> 05:00:48.500
I mean, it's, I can't.

2792
05:00:48.500 --> 05:00:56.500
Well, the notion is that it's a charge because what it's providing benefits the entire system.

2793
05:00:56.500 --> 05:01:02.500
It's not something that just creates a pool of money that those.

2794
05:01:02.500 --> 05:01:08.500
OK, Representative Oxenman, you were not, you were recognized for a question.

2795
05:01:08.500 --> 05:02:17.000
So Representative McG are now thank you thank you um i i actually also wanted to mention i think some of the folks are not understanding that the public utilities commission actually has the regulatory power the authority to set rates and so that's what the utilities commission does for us as our agent so we there was it's set up statutorily that we don't have to have the expertise to be working on all of the details of that they do that and so this comes under the that rate setting and i think that's how it is that the authority is best aligned over there with oversight from us, but not taking away every time they want to do something that we have to vote on it, because that is a very cumbersome bureaucratic process.

2796
05:02:17.000 --> 05:02:19.500
Is there a question there?

2797
05:02:19.500 --> 05:02:22.000
We have a utilities commission.

2798
05:02:22.000 --> 05:02:24.500
Is there a question there?

2799
05:02:24.500 --> 05:02:38.000
No, it's actually a clarification because several people had asked why these bureaucrats have this and it's they have that authority because we gave it to them.

2800
05:02:38.000 --> 05:02:41.000
That's all I'm trying to say.

2801
05:02:41.000 --> 05:02:43.500
That's how it's set up.

2802
05:02:43.500 --> 05:02:45.500
That's how it works.

2803
05:02:45.500 --> 05:02:50.000
So that's how our national government is set up.

2804
05:02:50.000 --> 05:02:55.500
And state all of the states are set up that way.

2805
05:02:55.500 --> 05:03:00.000
Well, we're not here to debate this issue, but...

2806
05:03:00.000 --> 05:03:02.000
But understanding is important.

2807
05:03:02.000 --> 05:03:04.000
People don't understand...

2808
05:03:04.000 --> 05:03:07.000
I'm not correct about that, actually.

2809
05:03:07.000 --> 05:03:22.000
The system benefits charge used to be specified in statute, and it was only after the EPRS was adopted that the system benefits charge was no longer specified in statute.

2810
05:03:22.000 --> 05:03:25.500
So next up is Representative Kelly Pitts.

2811
05:03:25.500 --> 05:03:39.000
Representative Mann, I want to try to understand this legislation and I'm going to try to put it back to when I was on the school board.

2812
05:03:39.000 --> 05:03:47.500
I remember we used to, you know, we passed the budget and we went in every direction.

2813
05:03:47.500 --> 05:04:00.000
And we had about a two and a half hour debate on the size of soccer ball and what size soccer balls we should buy.

2814
05:04:00.000 --> 05:04:50.000
Do you think that legislation right now to allow the legislators to set the systems benefits charge would be that kind of a situation where we are legislating small things and not just overseeing what's happening with the electric companies and what's happening with the systems benefits judge we get their report i do believe and i'm going to ask you if you will concur we do get reports annually about what they're doing and if we notice something that we think is out of whack can we call them to account and can the PUC call them to account?

2815
05:04:50.000 --> 05:05:01.000
In other words if somebody decided to 250 percent increase the systems benefits charge could we call them to account for that?

2816
05:05:01.000 --> 05:05:03.000
We have that already.

2817
05:05:03.000 --> 05:05:20.000
Well, we have, you know, the PUC has extensive reports and the EERS is separately extensive reports and it is up to the legislature if we care to pay attention to review those reports.

2818
05:05:20.000 --> 05:05:22.000
May I follow?

2819
05:05:22.000 --> 05:05:24.000
Yes, follow up.

2820
05:05:24.000 --> 05:05:26.000
Thank you.

2821
05:05:26.000 --> 05:05:28.000
reports.

2822
05:05:28.000 --> 05:05:30.000
May I follow?

2823
05:05:30.000 --> 05:05:32.000
Yes, follow up.

2824
05:05:32.000 --> 05:05:39.000
We have an electric utility restructuring committee, which became the electric utility oversight committee.

2825
05:05:39.000 --> 05:05:50.000
Do you believe that overseeing some of the things that go on that we were afraid might happen belongs in that committee?

2826
05:05:50.000 --> 05:06:11.500
Yeah, I would say that committee or one like it, but I think that committee, you know, it's all a matter of how much scope of subject matter they want to cover it, whether you have that committee or another one like it.

2827
05:06:11.500 --> 05:06:31.000
But I think it's a good I think that's a fine way to do the oversight is to have a group of legislators that can look at a report that's 50, 100 pages long and understand what it means.

2828
05:06:31.000 --> 05:06:33.000
Thank you.

2829
05:06:33.000 --> 05:06:35.000
Thank you.

2830
05:06:35.000 --> 05:06:38.500
Representative Nader is recognized for a question.

2831
05:06:38.500 --> 05:06:40.500
Thank you.

2832
05:06:40.500 --> 05:06:42.500
Thank you.

2833
05:06:42.500 --> 05:06:46.000
Representative Nauter is recognized for a question.

2834
05:06:46.000 --> 05:06:48.000
Thank you.

2835
05:06:48.000 --> 05:06:52.000
Is the assistance benefit charge voluntary or mandatory?

2836
05:06:52.000 --> 05:06:57.500
It's on your bill and you have to pay it, yes.

2837
05:06:57.500 --> 05:06:59.500
Well, it's not voluntary.

2838
05:06:59.500 --> 05:07:04.500
You can turn off your electric power, but that's it.

2839
05:07:04.500 --> 05:07:06.500
Okay, thank you.

2840
05:07:06.500 --> 05:07:09.500
Next up would be Representative Oxidam.

2841
05:07:09.500 --> 05:07:14.000
Yes, thank you very much for taking my question.

2842
05:07:14.000 --> 05:07:54.000
If I might be permitted to just clarify this issue about the system benefit charge, the reason it's on your bill is because this is money which is collected from all ratepayers that is invested in our energy system and reduces the amount of money that we have to pay, all of us, because we're able to invest in things that reduce waste and allow us to have lower peaks so that we don't have to build out more transmission.

2843
05:07:54.000 --> 05:07:58.500
We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars in savings.

2844
05:07:58.500 --> 05:08:02.500
That's on page 23 of the 10-year report.

2845
05:08:02.500 --> 05:08:08.500
And also $160 million added to New Hampshire's gross domestic product annually.

2846
05:08:08.500 --> 05:08:20.500
When we invest the money so that we do things better and more efficiently, we save money, we grow jobs, we grow the economy.

2847
05:08:20.500 --> 05:08:26.500
Cutting this system's benefit charge does more than cut off our nose.

2848
05:08:26.500 --> 05:08:29.000
It's cutting off our heads.

2849
05:08:29.000 --> 05:08:32.000
Is there a question there, Representative?

2850
05:08:32.000 --> 05:08:52.500
No, and I asked at the outset if I could make a statement to clarify because I felt that we weren't getting to the nub of what the system benefits charge is, and that was a question that was raised earlier.

2851
05:08:52.500 --> 05:08:54.500
Okay.

2852
05:08:54.500 --> 05:08:56.500
Thank you.

2853
05:08:56.500 --> 05:08:58.500
Representative Sockeson.

2854
05:08:58.500 --> 05:09:00.500
Thank you, sir.

2855
05:09:00.500 --> 05:09:02.500
Thank you, Mr.

2856
05:09:02.500 --> 05:09:04.500
Chairman.

2857
05:09:04.500 --> 05:09:09.000
And thank you, Representative Mann, for taking my question.

2858
05:09:09.000 --> 05:09:12.500
And my question is this to you.

2859
05:09:12.500 --> 05:09:16.000
Does this definition sound familiar to you?

2860
05:09:16.000 --> 05:09:34.000
Part of the electric bill that is designated to be used for funding statewide energy efficiency initiatives grants to insulate low and middle income housing and assistance to low income customers in meeting their energy expenses.

2861
05:09:34.000 --> 05:09:40.000
Yes, although I would hope that we would, yes, that's pretty much.

2862
05:09:40.000 --> 05:09:42.500
That's the SBC definition here.

2863
05:09:42.500 --> 05:09:48.000
Yeah, but I would think, I would hope that we would.

2864
05:09:48.000 --> 05:09:50.000
Yes, that's pretty much.

2865
05:09:50.000 --> 05:09:52.500
That's the SBC definition here.

2866
05:09:52.500 --> 05:10:05.000
Yeah, but I would think I would hope that in the long run, we'd substitute energy efficiency for rate relief for the low income people.

2867
05:10:05.000 --> 05:10:08.000
I'm just reading from the definition.

2868
05:10:08.000 --> 05:10:17.000
That doesn't imply that some of the low-end, low-income housing is actually suitable for actually making more efficient.

2869
05:10:17.000 --> 05:10:21.500
Some of the mobile homes may be really difficult.

2870
05:10:21.500 --> 05:10:23.500
Sure, granted.

2871
05:10:23.500 --> 05:10:25.500
Thank you.

2872
05:10:25.500 --> 05:10:27.500
Thank you.

2873
05:10:27.500 --> 05:10:32.500
We have two other people who would like to testify.

2874
05:10:32.500 --> 05:11:00.500
So I would like to now thank you, Representative Mann, for introducing the bill'd like to now call on joseph kwasnik mr kwasnik you are allowed to testify and you are home thank you mr chairman can you hear me yes we can hear you i'm providing oral testimony today in support of House Bill 119.

2875
05:11:00.500 --> 05:11:20.500
Just to reiterate what's, I think, part of the conversation we've been having is that the authority of the PHA to oversee the pending rates and by extension of the benefit charge included in rates is specifically authorized by statute.

2876
05:11:20.500 --> 05:11:48.000
and is therefore the authority derived from the legislation pursuant to part one article 28 of the new hampshire constitution um also in support of of this legislation requiring legislative approval for increases in the sdc is inconsistent with long-standing legislation i would point that back in 1996, original restructuring legislation was put into place.

2877
05:11:48.000 --> 05:12:00.500
These provisions providing for the legislature to authorize the public utility commission to set rates and also to set benefit charges were in that original.

2878
05:12:00.500 --> 05:12:12.500
Clearly, the POC is better situated to evaluate the needs for increasing the system benefit charge in the new action of the general court.

2879
05:12:12.500 --> 05:12:14.500
Mr.

2880
05:12:14.500 --> 05:12:19.000
Chairman, we're having a hard time hearing the witness.

2881
05:12:19.000 --> 05:12:22.000
Okay, I'll speak a little up.

2882
05:12:22.000 --> 05:12:24.500
Can you hear me now?

2883
05:12:24.500 --> 05:12:27.000
Yes, thank you very much.

2884
05:12:27.000 --> 05:12:29.000
Thank you.

2885
05:12:29.000 --> 05:12:31.000
I'll start.

2886
05:12:31.000 --> 05:12:49.000
I won't start over, but requiring legislative approval for increases in the SBC is inconsistent, again, with longstanding legislation and the current function of the PUC to set rates and by extension the system's benefit charge.

2887
05:12:49.000 --> 05:13:05.500
Surely the PUC is better situated to evaluate the needs for increases in the system benefit charge than the New Hampshire General Court and can do so in an effective and timely manner.

2888
05:13:05.500 --> 05:13:09.000
Let's let the PUC do its job.

2889
05:13:09.000 --> 05:13:19.500
Also, just to remind, I have to keep reminding myself is that the legislature is a legislative body and enacts legislation.

2890
05:13:19.500 --> 05:13:32.500
The PUC is a regulatory body and as such is the correct authority to set rates and also enforce rates, which includes the system benefit charge.

2891
05:13:32.500 --> 05:13:38.500
We all have to stay within our respective legislative and regulatory guardrails.

2892
05:13:38.500 --> 05:13:48.000
So we hope we all keep that all in mind as you evaluate whether this bill passes or not.

2893
05:13:48.000 --> 05:13:52.500
Thank you for the opportunity to testify this afternoon.

2894
05:13:52.500 --> 05:13:54.500
Mr.

2895
05:13:54.500 --> 05:13:57.000
Chairman, thank you very much.

2896
05:13:57.000 --> 05:13:59.000
Mr.

2897
05:13:59.000 --> 05:14:01.500
Kwasnick, any questions for Mr.

2898
05:14:01.500 --> 05:14:03.500
Kwasnick?

2899
05:14:03.500 --> 05:14:07.000
Representative Somsich, do you have a question?

2900
05:14:07.000 --> 05:14:09.000
Sorry, Mr.

2901
05:14:09.000 --> 05:14:12.500
Chairman, I didn't take my hand down.

2902
05:14:12.500 --> 05:14:15.000
Seeing no questions for Mr.

2903
05:14:15.000 --> 05:14:17.500
Kwasnick, I will thank Mr.

2904
05:14:17.500 --> 05:14:19.500
Kwasnick for his testimony.

2905
05:14:19.500 --> 05:14:27.000
And call on our next testifier, who is Madeline Minot of Clean Energy New Hampshire.

2906
05:14:27.000 --> 05:14:30.500
So, are you on the list here?

2907
05:14:30.500 --> 05:14:36.000
You are now allowed to speak, and the floor is yours.

2908
05:14:36.000 --> 05:14:38.000
Thank you, Mr.

2909
05:14:38.000 --> 05:14:42.500
Chairman, for the opportunity to testify on this bill.

2910
05:14:42.500 --> 05:14:57.500
Clean Energy New Hampshire supports House Bill 119, and I'll be speaking to this bill and then later on to the next bill, which are really about the same issue.

2911
05:14:57.500 --> 05:15:06.000
should the legislature or the public utilities commission review and approve changes in the system benefits charge?

2912
05:15:06.000 --> 05:15:15.500
I submitted written testimony to you all yesterday, so I will try to not reiterate everything that's in there.

2913
05:15:15.500 --> 05:15:23.500
I will also try to answer some of the questions you all have been wrestling with.

2914
05:15:23.500 --> 05:15:38.000
To clarify, the system benefits charge funds a significant portion of the energy efficiency programs, the energy assistance programs, as well as allows the utilities to recover loss-based revenues.

2915
05:15:38.000 --> 05:15:47.500
The energy efficiency programs are also funded in part by RGGI auction revenues, as well as capacity market revenues.

2916
05:15:47.500 --> 05:15:59.000
But the system benefits charge represents the vast majority of the funding for the energy of revenues as well as capacity market revenues.

2917
05:15:59.000 --> 05:16:07.500
But the system benefits charge represents the vast majority of the funding for the energy efficiency programs.

2918
05:16:07.500 --> 05:16:17.000
It is our view that the system benefits charge is a utility rate, just like all other utility rates.

2919
05:16:17.000 --> 05:16:22.000
The PUC is best equipped to review and approve those.

2920
05:16:22.000 --> 05:16:44.500
The PUC has the time, the expertise to properly evaluate all the details of the programs that must be reviewed, analyzed, and understood to determine if a proposed system benefits charge change is just and reasonable and would generate a net benefit for rate payers.

2921
05:16:44.500 --> 05:17:03.500
There is ample opportunity for public input in the Public Utilities Commission's processes to weigh in on proposed rate changes, be it a rate case where they're going to change your distribution charge or the system benefits charge.

2922
05:17:03.500 --> 05:17:23.500
We have concerns that legislative approval due to the legislative schedule could cause significant delays and potential suspension in the programs, which would cause interruptions in contractors' workflow and cause them to have to lay off some of their staff.

2923
05:17:23.500 --> 05:17:34.500
And to answer your previous question, Representative Vos, about why do we need energy efficiency programs if energy efficiency is so great?

2924
05:17:34.500 --> 05:17:37.000
Well, there's a few reasons.

2925
05:17:37.000 --> 05:17:40.500
Customers respond to price signals and incentives.

2926
05:17:40.500 --> 05:17:50.500
The upfront cost can be significant and difficult to overcome for many, even though the payback can be quite short.

2927
05:17:50.500 --> 05:17:53.000
There's a lack of information.

2928
05:17:53.000 --> 05:18:10.000
The energy efficiency programs offer low-cost energy audits, and you don't really know where to start, which measures to undertake, or what the payback will be without the information provided by an energy audit.

2929
05:18:10.000 --> 05:18:17.500
And finally, the benefits go far beyond the person making the energy efficiency improvement themselves.

2930
05:18:17.500 --> 05:18:28.000
And most people don't always act in an altruistic manner to reduce their own energy use to benefit all rate payers.

2931
05:18:28.000 --> 05:18:37.000
Really, most people are looking out for themselves without a program that incentivizes them to make those changes.

2932
05:18:37.000 --> 05:18:51.500
So for all those reasons, but primarily because we think the system benefits charge is a utility rate that is best reviewed and approved at the Public Utilities Commission.

2933
05:18:51.500 --> 05:18:58.000
We support House Bill 119 and urge you to support it as well.

2934
05:18:58.000 --> 05:19:00.000
Thank you.

2935
05:19:00.000 --> 05:19:02.000
Questions for Ms.

2936
05:19:02.000 --> 05:19:04.000
Minow?

2937
05:19:04.000 --> 05:19:06.000
Representative Oxen.

2938
05:19:06.000 --> 05:19:08.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

2939
05:19:08.500 --> 05:19:11.000
Chair, for taking my question.

2940
05:19:11.000 --> 05:19:13.000
Ms.

2941
05:19:13.000 --> 05:19:29.500
Minow, you mentioned that people needed energy audit in order to know what they need and what they can do and what funds might be available to help a portion of their investment.

2942
05:19:29.500 --> 05:19:35.500
Could you explain how did the energy audit get into this conversation?

2943
05:19:35.500 --> 05:19:46.000
Representative Vose has asked, if energy efficiency is so great, why do people don't just do it on their own, right?

2944
05:19:46.000 --> 05:19:53.500
As a homeowner, you could say, oh, great, well, I'm going to do these incentives.

2945
05:19:53.500 --> 05:19:56.500
Why do we need NH saves?

2946
05:19:56.500 --> 05:20:01.500
And why do we need the utilities to get involved?

2947
05:20:01.500 --> 05:20:05.000
Why do we need rebates and incentives?

2948
05:20:05.000 --> 05:20:40.000
And one of the four reasons I gave is that there's a lack of information for homeowners or business owners or building owners as to how to identify and prioritize potential energy efficiency measures and what the payback of an investment on those measures would be that you don't know unless an energy audit is done or a professional evaluates your energy use, your current equipment, your current building envelope.

2949
05:20:40.000 --> 05:20:47.000
And so that's an important service that is offered by our energy efficiency programs.

2950
05:20:47.000 --> 05:20:49.000
Thank you very much.

2951
05:20:49.000 --> 05:20:51.000
Thank you.

2952
05:20:51.000 --> 05:20:53.500
Next up is Representative Mayer.

2953
05:20:53.500 --> 05:20:55.500
I forget to unmute.

2954
05:20:55.500 --> 05:20:57.500
Yes, thank you.

2955
05:20:57.500 --> 05:21:02.000
Yeah, the auditor is quite a variety of things.

2956
05:21:02.000 --> 05:21:16.000
So in Massachusetts, my daughter's house, he just walked in, he had a box full of CFLs and he went and changed all the bulbs in the house.

2957
05:21:16.000 --> 05:21:23.500
Then he walked around, looked at the attic and then he wrote a little contract.

2958
05:21:23.500 --> 05:21:28.500
And, you know, this is what it's going to cost.

2959
05:21:28.500 --> 05:21:32.500
It's what your benefit is going to be.

2960
05:21:32.500 --> 05:21:35.500
And it's a yes or no.

2961
05:21:35.500 --> 05:21:40.000
And it was really clear, a more complicated one.

2962
05:21:40.000 --> 05:21:45.500
We have a big stone library in our in our town.

2963
05:21:45.500 --> 05:21:50.000
We had a very experienced auditor to go up.

2964
05:21:50.000 --> 05:22:00.500
She had a blower door that would suck air out of the building so that, you know, where there were leaks.

2965
05:22:00.500 --> 05:22:06.000
You could see with an infrared camera, which she also had.

2966
05:22:06.000 --> 05:22:11.000
She calculated the amount of BTUs going up the stack.

2967
05:22:11.000 --> 05:22:15.000
I mean, it was a complete technical audit.

2968
05:22:15.000 --> 05:22:18.500
So they range between those two things.

2969
05:22:18.500 --> 05:22:24.000
And it generally sets the price and describes what to do.

2970
05:22:24.000 --> 05:22:37.000
We did have, I do have an experience with a local community action agency that was given a thumb rule on how to do energy efficiency.

2971
05:22:37.000 --> 05:22:48.500
And that is you seal the basement, you seal the attic so there won't be a flow of air up through the house.

2972
05:22:48.500 --> 05:23:01.000
That made the house unlivable because the furnace was sucked so much air and it had no way to get it out of the cellar.

2973
05:23:01.000 --> 05:23:18.000
It had to get it out through the living spaces in the house and the house leaked like a sieve and we never got it up above 50 and the tenant left in January.

2974
05:23:18.000 --> 05:23:27.500
So you do need an auditor that understands the subtleties of And you get it free with NH saves.

2975
05:23:27.500 --> 05:23:33.500
And you get it free with a mass save too, of course.

2976
05:23:33.500 --> 05:23:35.500
Okay.

2977
05:23:35.500 --> 05:23:38.000
Next up is Representative Somsich.

2978
05:23:38.000 --> 05:23:40.000
Thank you, Mr.

2979
05:23:40.000 --> 05:23:42.500
Chairman, and thank you, Ms.

2980
05:23:42.500 --> 05:23:45.000
Minow, for taking my question.

2981
05:23:45.000 --> 05:24:05.000
In light of the fact that the energy audit is really the first step, do you have any idea of how many households or residents actually have participated in energy audits for their homes, either a percentage or the numbers?

2982
05:24:05.000 --> 05:24:07.000
Any rough idea?

2983
05:24:07.000 --> 05:24:13.500
I'm sorry, I don't have those numbers off the top of my head.

2984
05:24:13.500 --> 05:24:20.000
There are numbers of participants for each programs in the NHSAVE's larger programs.

2985
05:24:20.000 --> 05:24:28.500
So when we're talking about weatherization and energy audits, that's the Home Performance with Energy Star program.

2986
05:24:28.500 --> 05:24:31.500
That's the Fuel Neutral Weatherization program.

2987
05:24:31.500 --> 05:24:37.000
There's also the HEA program, which is the income qualified programs.

2988
05:24:37.000 --> 05:24:43.000
So there are many different programs for many different types of customers.

2989
05:24:43.000 --> 05:24:45.500
There's also commercial industrial programs.

2990
05:24:45.500 --> 05:25:02.500
So we would have to, I'd have to understand a little bit more exactly which program and then we'd have to add up all the past participants, but it is a significant number, certainly.

2991
05:25:02.500 --> 05:25:04.500
Dr.

2992
05:25:04.500 --> 05:25:06.500
Follow up?

2993
05:25:06.500 --> 05:25:08.500
Dr.

2994
05:25:08.500 --> 05:25:10.500
Follow up.

2995
05:25:10.500 --> 05:25:12.500
Dr.

2996
05:25:12.500 --> 05:25:16.500
Well, then the question asked a little differently.

2997
05:25:16.500 --> 05:25:27.500
Do you feel that there is still a large potential for energy gains if more people made use of the energy audits?

2998
05:25:27.500 --> 05:25:31.500
Or have we already exhausted most of these?

2999
05:25:31.500 --> 05:25:37.500
There's a tremendous amount of energy efficiency potential left in New Hampshire.

3000
05:25:37.500 --> 05:25:48.500
New Hampshire was the last state in New England to adopt an energy efficiency resource standard, and we've been quite far behind.

3001
05:25:48.500 --> 05:26:32.000
As part of the 2021 to 2023 energy efficiency resource standard planning process, which was done over the last year in a public process at the Public Utilities Commission, that plan is still pending before the commission, there was an energy efficiency potential study done by the utilities, by a consultant of the utilities, and they identified that there is in fact a tremendous amount of potential energy efficiency gains that are very cost effective to be achieved here in New Hampshire to benefit all rate payers.

3002
05:26:32.000 --> 05:26:43.500
And that potential study recommended much higher energy savings goals than what ended up being proposed as a middle of the road approach.

3003
05:26:43.500 --> 05:26:51.500
So we certainly have much left to gain and could be more aggressive on energy efficiency.

3004
05:26:51.500 --> 05:26:53.500
Thank you, Representative.

3005
05:26:53.500 --> 05:26:55.500
Thank you.

3006
05:26:55.500 --> 05:26:57.500
You're recognizing our question.

3007
05:26:57.500 --> 05:26:59.500
Yes, thank you, Chair.

3008
05:26:59.500 --> 05:27:01.500
Thank you, Ms.

3009
05:27:01.500 --> 05:27:04.000
Gonneau, for taking my question.

3010
05:27:04.000 --> 05:27:13.000
Earlier, you had mentioned that you equated the system's benefit charge to a utility charge, a utility cost.

3011
05:27:13.000 --> 05:27:19.000
And I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this correctly.

3012
05:27:19.000 --> 05:27:28.000
Utility costs, obviously you all have the, QC has the authority to regulate these utility monthly tangible charges.

3013
05:27:28.000 --> 05:27:31.500
But for this, this is a program.

3014
05:27:31.500 --> 05:27:34.500
This isn't a monthly utility expense.

3015
05:27:34.500 --> 05:27:37.000
This is actually a program.

3016
05:27:37.000 --> 05:27:39.500
Am I clear on that?

3017
05:27:39.500 --> 05:27:45.500
It is a program run by the utilities to benefit rate payers.

3018
05:27:45.500 --> 05:27:47.500
Yes.

3019
05:27:47.500 --> 05:27:52.500
Right, but it is not the same as a monthly...

3020
05:27:52.500 --> 05:27:54.500
I'm sorry, Chair.

3021
05:27:54.500 --> 05:27:57.500
I didn't have to follow up.

3022
05:27:57.500 --> 05:27:59.500
That's quite all right.

3023
05:27:59.500 --> 05:28:02.000
Go ahead and follow up.

3024
05:28:02.000 --> 05:28:27.000
Right, but I just want to make sure it is, as you're stating before, it is not equivalent to a monthly utility charge that you have the authority to alter and change as the demand and a lot of complicated factors go into as far as the day-by-day utility costs.

3025
05:28:27.000 --> 05:28:29.000
This is a program.

3026
05:28:29.000 --> 05:28:36.000
It is a program that is just as complicated as a utility rate case.

3027
05:28:36.000 --> 05:28:49.000
And unlike when your distribution charge goes up for the same service you've always gotten, if we increase energy efficiency gains, you're getting a net benefit.

3028
05:28:49.000 --> 05:28:52.500
And so it is a utility rate.

3029
05:28:52.500 --> 05:29:09.000
It is a cost on your utility bill that is administered and run by the utilities in New Hampshire, which we believe is best reviewed, evaluated, and approved by the Public Utilities Commission.

3030
05:29:09.000 --> 05:29:12.500
Representative Thomas is recognized for a question.

3031
05:29:12.500 --> 05:29:14.500
Thank you, Mr.

3032
05:29:14.500 --> 05:29:16.500
Chair.

3033
05:29:16.500 --> 05:29:33.500
just to be clear uh mr no are you saying that the electric utility companies are the ones responsible for putting this up for watching this program and getting the money and keeping it?

3034
05:29:33.500 --> 05:29:49.000
Or are you saying that the state has mandated and required this electric utility companies to run this program and because they're regulated, they'll do whatever the policy tells them to.

3035
05:29:49.000 --> 05:29:57.000
But it's really they're doing it because the state has mandated them to actually run it.

3036
05:29:57.000 --> 05:29:59.000
Is that correct?

3037
05:29:59.000 --> 05:30:07.000
Representative, you may want to ask the utilities how they feel about being the program administrators.

3038
05:30:07.000 --> 05:30:24.500
But I can tell you that in all of the meetings that I attend, they defend their they very strongly defend wanting to remain the program administrators for the energy efficiency programs in New Hampshire.

3039
05:30:24.500 --> 05:30:35.500
It has been discussed in other states, you know, Efficiency Vermont or Efficiency Maine are separate nonprofits that administer the efficiency programs.

3040
05:30:35.500 --> 05:30:41.500
Our utilities have fought back vehemently against even mentioning that potential idea.

3041
05:30:41.500 --> 05:30:49.000
So it is my understanding that they very much want to be running these programs.

3042
05:30:49.000 --> 05:30:54.500
They also receive a performance incentive for effectively running the programs.

3043
05:30:54.500 --> 05:30:57.000
They've done a good job.

3044
05:30:57.000 --> 05:31:03.000
And my understanding is that they would like to keep doing that.

3045
05:31:03.000 --> 05:31:05.000
Thank you.

3046
05:31:05.000 --> 05:31:09.000
But that wasn't quite the question I asked.

3047
05:31:09.000 --> 05:31:11.500
So I'll ask it again.

3048
05:31:11.500 --> 05:31:15.500
Did the electric utility companies initiate this program?

3049
05:31:15.500 --> 05:31:27.000
Or did the state mandate this program and ask utilities if they would run it, therefore they don't mind running it at all?

3050
05:31:27.000 --> 05:31:29.000
Which one was it?

3051
05:31:29.000 --> 05:31:37.500
You know, the initial energy efficiency core programs certainly predate my involvement in in New Hampshire policy.

3052
05:31:37.500 --> 05:31:42.500
So I'm not sure exactly how the core program started.

3053
05:31:42.500 --> 05:31:46.000
So I will not answer that question.

3054
05:31:46.000 --> 05:31:48.000
Follow up.

3055
05:31:48.000 --> 05:31:50.000
Okay, well, thank you.

3056
05:31:50.000 --> 05:32:23.500
So again, my question would be is if there was, let's say a limit as to the amount of SBC charges that the PUC could regulate to their liking, do you feel that there should be a limit and if a limit is therefore reached that the legislature that the legislature should therefore enact additional policy, whether to extend it or not to that degree of control?

3057
05:32:23.500 --> 05:32:53.000
If the legislature wishes to resort back to the core program, which is what it sounds like what you're describing, when we made the shift from the way efficiency programs used to be run in New Hampshire, which was there was a specific limited budget allocated to efficiency, and then the utilities did what they could with that budget.

3058
05:32:53.000 --> 05:33:18.500
That's a completely fundamentally different approach than an energy efficiency resource standard, which aims to first determine what the energy savings goals should be, and then what are the best programs to achieve those goals, and then what is the cost with a positive cost-benefit analysis to do to achieve those.

3059
05:33:18.500 --> 05:33:29.500
and our current statewide energy strategy says that it should be the policy of the state to achieve all cost- energy efficiency.

3060
05:33:29.500 --> 05:33:34.500
That is best achieved through an energy efficiency resource standard.

3061
05:33:34.500 --> 05:33:46.000
So it is up to the legislature to decide if you want to completely change the approach and putting budgets first, that's different.

3062
05:33:46.000 --> 05:33:52.000
We would be resorting back to what New Hampshire used to do.

3063
05:33:52.000 --> 05:34:02.000
However, in order to approve the SBC under the current model, reviewing every detail of the programs would be necessary.

3064
05:34:02.000 --> 05:34:12.000
And I don't think that the legislature has the time to delve into that in the detail that is necessary.

3065
05:34:12.000 --> 05:34:20.500
That's why I think it would be more appropriate for the Public Utilities Commission to do that.

3066
05:34:20.500 --> 05:34:22.500
Okay, thank you.

3067
05:34:22.500 --> 05:34:25.000
Next up is Representative McGee.

3068
05:34:25.000 --> 05:34:27.000
Thank you, Mr.

3069
05:34:27.000 --> 05:34:29.000
Chairman.

3070
05:34:29.000 --> 05:34:54.500
My question actually goes along with that because I waited a little while, so you sort of delved into this, but my understanding is that the purpose of the Public Utilities Commission is to allow those deep dives so we can be a little more strategic about how we do things.

3071
05:34:54.500 --> 05:35:02.000
So my question is, how well does the Public Utilities Commission rate setting process work?

3072
05:35:02.000 --> 05:35:06.500
Or can you give us some insights into the...

3073
05:35:06.500 --> 05:35:24.500
You have mentioned some of the things that they would do in the course of rate setting, but I know that you participate in those hearings and you have a lot more experience than we do.

3074
05:35:24.500 --> 05:35:42.000
So I guess the question is, do you think the legislature would be able to replicate the processes that the PUC undertakes in order to determine whether the rates should or should not be raised?

3075
05:35:42.000 --> 05:35:45.000
No, I think the legislature doesn't.

3076
05:35:45.000 --> 05:35:49.500
The PUC has a full staff of utility analysts.

3077
05:35:49.500 --> 05:35:59.000
They also have access to expert consultants, which assists them in evaluating the details of proposed plans and rates.

3078
05:35:59.000 --> 05:36:16.000
the efficiency docket that we just completed which is still awaiting an order lasted from September to December but it followed an almost year-long planning process that led to the filing made in September.

3079
05:36:16.000 --> 05:36:22.000
The docket that we just completed included roughly 28 hours of hearings.

3080
05:36:22.000 --> 05:36:29.000
That's following multiple tech sessions, following multiple hours of settlement negotiations between the parties.

3081
05:36:29.000 --> 05:36:34.000
There is an opportunity to intervene for organizations like ours.

3082
05:36:34.000 --> 05:36:38.000
Really anyone that has an interest may intervene.

3083
05:36:38.000 --> 05:36:45.000
There is also ample public comment that is submitted and considered in the dockets.

3084
05:36:45.000 --> 05:36:47.000
And follow up?

3085
05:36:47.000 --> 05:36:49.000
Follow up.

3086
05:36:49.000 --> 05:36:51.000
Thank you.

3087
05:36:51.000 --> 05:36:53.000
Thank you.

3088
05:36:53.000 --> 05:37:39.000
that is submitted and considered in the dockets and follow-up follow-up thank you um and uh i didn't write down my question um oh and so is one of the components this is my understanding so we should raise this point as well because i think it's been mentioned already, but it's important, is that one of the components of the considerations of these dockets is part of the mission of the PUC is to make sure that it's the least cost benefit for the people, the citizens of New Hampshire, right?

3089
05:37:39.000 --> 05:37:47.000
So there's a component of it where they're already looking at whether it's a good deal.

3090
05:37:47.000 --> 05:37:53.500
We don't have to keep policing the good deal because that's their mission.

3091
05:37:53.500 --> 05:37:55.500
Is that correct?

3092
05:37:55.500 --> 05:37:57.500
Absolutely.

3093
05:37:57.500 --> 05:38:12.000
You know, every decision that the commission makes has to be in the public interest, and they have to find that any charges to customers are just and reasonable.

3094
05:38:12.000 --> 05:38:33.500
And the energy efficiency programs, which are funded by the system benefits charge, every dollar that goes into the programs has to pass a very stringent cost benefit test that shows that the benefits for rate payers are greater than the program costs.

3095
05:38:33.500 --> 05:38:50.000
And I shared with you with my written testimony yesterday, a bill impact analysis, because I know representative asked often, well, what about the people who pay into the program and don't participate?

3096
05:38:50.000 --> 05:38:57.000
And that bill impact analysis shows for exactly shows participants, non-participants and average customers.

3097
05:38:57.000 --> 05:39:08.500
And so in many cases, even non-participants get a net benefit from what, on their bill, from what they pay into the programs.

3098
05:39:08.500 --> 05:39:10.500
Thank you.

3099
05:39:10.500 --> 05:39:12.500
Thank you.

3100
05:39:12.500 --> 05:39:44.500
Next up, we have one more person who would like to testify by the way on this bill if you'd like to hold your questions until that person testifies or not representative man do you need to ask a question right now or would you prefer to wait oh sorry no i don't i'm all set okay thank you I put my hand down.

3101
05:39:44.500 --> 05:39:50.500
I testify then is Kathy Corkery representing the New Hampshire Sierra Club.

3102
05:39:50.500 --> 05:39:54.500
and why did you disappear up okay Okay.

3103
05:39:54.500 --> 05:39:56.500
Ms.

3104
05:39:56.500 --> 05:39:58.500
Clark, you are up.

3105
05:39:58.500 --> 05:40:00.500
Hello.

3106
05:40:00.500 --> 05:40:02.500
Good afternoon.

3107
05:40:02.500 --> 05:40:08.000
Thank you so much, Chairman Vose, for allowing me to speak.

3108
05:40:08.000 --> 05:40:45.500
I had some, I originally had some trouble signing in and your records may show that I signed in opposing this bill and I would like to correct that and say that New Hampshire Sierra Club supports this bill, Hb 119 and um that we feel that politicizing rate making um is not a really good precedent um that these are complicated issues not to say that any of you cannot grasp what's going on.

3109
05:40:45.500 --> 05:41:09.000
Certainly you can, but there is timeliness and lots of input from the utilities and the public that the PUC allows for that goes beyond the calendar of the legislature and that it's very thorough and that these programs are very beneficial to everyone in New Hampshire.

3110
05:41:09.000 --> 05:41:29.000
I got my Unitel bill today and I last month was charged 89 cents for the systems benefit charge and I'm and I'm I think that's kind of important to show that every penny counts in these kinds of programs.

3111
05:41:29.000 --> 05:41:38.000
That it doesn't take a lot to lift the elephant, as they say, when there are many hands.

3112
05:41:38.000 --> 05:41:45.500
And I really think this is a great program that doesn't need to be politicized.

3113
05:41:45.500 --> 05:41:51.500
And I applaud the sponsors of this bill for putting it in.

3114
05:41:51.500 --> 05:41:53.500
Thank you.

3115
05:41:53.500 --> 05:41:55.500
Oh, and I apologize.

3116
05:41:55.500 --> 05:41:58.000
My name is Catherine Corkery.

3117
05:41:58.000 --> 05:42:02.500
I'm the chapter director of New Hampshire Sierra Club.

3118
05:42:02.500 --> 05:42:04.500
Thank you, Ms.

3119
05:42:04.500 --> 05:42:06.500
Corkery, for your testimony.

3120
05:42:06.500 --> 05:42:09.500
Nice to hear your voice again.

3121
05:42:09.500 --> 05:42:13.500
It's ironic that you mentioned your electric bill.

3122
05:42:13.500 --> 05:42:18.500
I just looked at my January electric bill as well.

3123
05:42:18.500 --> 05:42:27.500
I'm a New Hampshire electric co-op member, and I paid $5.89 for the system benefits charge in January.

3124
05:42:27.500 --> 05:42:34.000
You might need to dip into that program, sir, if I might suggest.

3125
05:42:34.000 --> 05:42:36.500
It's a really great one.

3126
05:42:36.500 --> 05:42:38.500
In the previous month.

3127
05:42:38.500 --> 05:42:40.500
So, thank you.

3128
05:42:40.500 --> 05:42:42.500
Any questions for Ms.

3129
05:42:42.500 --> 05:42:44.500
Corcoran?

3130
05:42:44.500 --> 05:42:46.500
Thank you, sir.

3131
05:42:46.500 --> 05:42:48.500
Thank you.

3132
05:42:48.500 --> 05:43:47.000
Seeing none, I will close the public hearing on HB 119 by pointing out that the blue list featured 22 people signed in in support four people signed in in opposition including john potichick representative potichick uh patuchick representative mcwilliams signed in in support representative amin signed in an opposition and a citizen named Alex I'd sign in in in support representative amin signed in an opposition and a citizen named alex wide signed in in opposition the sierra club get moved over into the support column as as ms corkery requested pardon ms corkery mentioned that she had an error signed up in opposition and she wanted it to be recorded that she was in support.

3133
05:43:47.000 --> 05:43:58.500
And I just wondered if in the numbers of 23 pro and four against, maybe that should be 24 pro and three against.

3134
05:43:58.500 --> 05:44:02.000
I recorded her on the testimony sheets.

3135
05:44:02.000 --> 05:44:04.000
It was recorded.

3136
05:44:04.000 --> 05:44:06.000
Thank you very much.

3137
05:44:06.000 --> 05:44:10.500
We will open the public hearing on HB 351.

3138
05:44:10.500 --> 05:44:15.500
And the prime sponsor of that bill is Representative Harrington.

3139
05:44:15.500 --> 05:44:21.000
So Representative Harrington, you have the floor to introduce your bill.

3140
05:44:21.000 --> 05:44:23.000
Thank you, Mr.

3141
05:44:23.000 --> 05:44:25.000
Chairman.

3142
05:44:25.000 --> 05:44:39.000
I'm not going to waste a lot of time going over system benefit charges because we just spent the last hour, an hour and a half on that.

3143
05:44:39.000 --> 05:44:43.500
So what the bill does is two things, basically.

3144
05:44:43.500 --> 05:44:53.000
The first is to say it makes the system benefit charge something that we use to benefit the system.

3145
05:44:53.000 --> 05:44:57.500
This is the way it always used to be.

3146
05:44:57.500 --> 05:45:03.500
It was always used for energy efficiency programs that reduced electric consumption.

3147
05:45:03.500 --> 05:45:19.500
Back some time, in fact, I was actually on the commission when this happened, the utilities basically said, we got so much money and we don't have enough projects to save electricity.

3148
05:45:19.500 --> 05:45:26.000
So we want to start using it on thermal projects, which was allowed.

3149
05:45:26.000 --> 05:45:31.500
I think that was a mistake I made at the time.

3150
05:45:31.500 --> 05:45:37.000
If you want to benefit the system, you benefit the system.

3151
05:45:37.000 --> 05:45:46.500
And putting an insulation in someone's house who has oil heat does almost no savings on their electric bill.

3152
05:45:46.500 --> 05:45:55.500
So the concept that somehow everybody's getting a benefit from someone else's house being insulated just isn't true.

3153
05:45:55.500 --> 05:46:14.000
If you really feel that there's a need to subsidize insulation projects, then you should be putting a tax, because that's what it is, a tax on oil, a tax on natural gas, a tax on wood.

3154
05:46:14.000 --> 05:46:16.500
That's what you're saving on.

3155
05:46:16.500 --> 05:46:20.500
You're saving on the consumption of those things.

3156
05:46:20.500 --> 05:46:24.500
You're not saving on the consumption of electricity.

3157
05:46:24.500 --> 05:46:27.000
So that's the first part.

3158
05:46:27.000 --> 05:46:40.000
And the second part, it makes it clear that only the legislature or the fiscal committee shall have the authority to increase the system benefits charge.

3159
05:46:40.000 --> 05:46:48.000
Now, we've heard a lot of discussion here today about it being a rate case issue.

3160
05:46:48.000 --> 05:47:08.500
And I'll have to say, I'm going to guess, I could be wrong, but I'm going to guess I'm the only one in the room or on the phone that's actually been involved in a rate case that's on this committee.

3161
05:47:08.500 --> 05:47:21.000
And rate cases are extremely complicated, and they take weeks and weeks and weeks to go through with all sorts of witnesses and so forth.

3162
05:47:21.000 --> 05:47:28.500
This is not, the system benefit charge is nowhere near on that level of complication.

3163
05:47:28.500 --> 05:47:37.000
It's a, you come up with it and say, this is how much we're going to spend.

3164
05:47:37.000 --> 05:47:43.000
And you evaluate what the results you got from the year before.

3165
05:47:43.000 --> 05:47:52.500
And if they, if people feel as though, well, this is working so great, we need to change it.

3166
05:47:52.500 --> 05:47:58.500
They can easily come back to the legislature and bump it up.

3167
05:47:58.500 --> 05:48:09.000
That's the way it should be done, because it is like a tax, and the legislature should be making those decisions.

3168
05:48:09.000 --> 05:48:22.000
So, you know, the other thing, the one thing I wanted to stress on the first part of there, again, is this concept that everybody benefits.

3169
05:48:22.000 --> 05:48:34.500
There may be other things you want to look at, because you're because less oil is being burned or less natural gas is being consumed.

3170
05:48:34.500 --> 05:48:41.000
But that doesn't do anything to save someone money on their electric bill.

3171
05:48:41.000 --> 05:48:45.500
The only person that benefits that is the recipient.

3172
05:48:45.500 --> 05:48:50.000
So I don't think we should be using it.

3173
05:48:50.000 --> 05:48:56.000
It was never done that way up until a few years ago.

3174
05:48:56.000 --> 05:49:03.500
And we should go back to spending the system benefit charge to benefit the system.

3175
05:49:03.500 --> 05:49:07.500
And I'll be glad to take any questions.

3176
05:49:07.500 --> 05:49:09.500
Thank you, Representative Harrington.

3177
05:49:09.500 --> 05:49:13.500
and I'll see glad to take any questions.

3178
05:49:13.500 --> 05:49:15.500
Thank you, Representative Harrington.

3179
05:49:15.500 --> 05:49:18.500
I have a question for you.

3180
05:49:18.500 --> 05:49:40.000
The system benefits charge is a separate charge on the electric bill, but if energy efficiency provides great benefits to the energy system itself, should energy efficiency charges actually be built into the rates that utilities, both gas and electric, charge their customers?

3181
05:49:40.000 --> 05:49:43.500
Well, that's a very good point, Mr.

3182
05:49:43.500 --> 05:49:45.500
Chairman.

3183
05:49:45.500 --> 05:50:00.000
In fact, it's an area that I broached with a few people over the last few months in that it's a real quantum shift in how we do things.

3184
05:50:00.000 --> 05:50:17.500
With the system benefit charge right now, we basically collect money and then we put it in the bucket and we hand the bucket to the utilities and say, go spend this money this year.

3185
05:50:17.500 --> 05:50:26.000
And they run around and try to do their best to spend all the money that's available.

3186
05:50:26.000 --> 05:50:30.000
And this is not small amounts of money.

3187
05:50:30.000 --> 05:50:38.500
We're talking tens of millions of dollars over the year, probably in the hundreds of millions now.

3188
05:50:38.500 --> 05:50:48.000
And so they spend that and they go out and they try to find the best projects they can.

3189
05:50:48.000 --> 05:50:58.000
But their goal basically is here's the amount of money you've got to spend, go find projects to meet them.

3190
05:50:58.000 --> 05:51:28.500
I would think a longer term fix that would work better would be if the utilities started looking at projects that was going to save electricity and then said, look, if we implement this, whatever it is we're going to implement, we can reduce the consumption of electricity over a period of time and they would get compensated to do that.

3191
05:51:28.500 --> 05:51:34.500
But that's sort of a different direction than what we presently have.

3192
05:51:34.500 --> 05:51:39.500
And that would be a major change in the program.

3193
05:51:39.500 --> 05:51:43.500
And I'm not proposing that at this time.

3194
05:51:43.500 --> 05:51:52.000
And of course, the other thing I should have mentioned is I did last year run down.

3195
05:51:52.000 --> 05:51:59.000
I got a bill from Eversource for Eastern Massachusetts and one for New Hampshire.

3196
05:51:59.000 --> 05:52:11.500
And when the same amount of electric consumption, the person in Massachusetts pays about 20 percent higher, higher bill than they do in New Hampshire.

3197
05:52:11.500 --> 05:52:23.000
So there's just throwing money at energy efficiency programs and more solar subsidies and so forth doesn't get you a lower electric bill.

3198
05:52:23.000 --> 05:52:25.000
So.

3199
05:52:25.000 --> 05:52:27.000
Thank you, Representative Harrington.

3200
05:52:27.000 --> 05:52:31.500
Do we have any further questions for Representative Harrington?

3201
05:52:31.500 --> 05:52:33.500
Representative Thomas.

3202
05:52:33.500 --> 05:52:35.500
Thank you, Mr.

3203
05:52:35.500 --> 05:52:37.500
Chairman.

3204
05:52:37.500 --> 05:52:39.500
Representative Harrington.

3205
05:52:39.500 --> 05:53:04.500
Do you think that in terms of trying to get more efficiency into our buildings and houses here in the state, do you think that we would be better served if we, if a different committee that is looked at housing codes and adjusting housing codes to build more homes?

3206
05:53:04.500 --> 05:53:07.500
Well, thank you for the question.

3207
05:53:07.500 --> 05:53:11.000
In fact, I believe that is done.

3208
05:53:11.000 --> 05:53:34.000
There's the state building codes that are updated on a regular basis that if you would look at the code today, for example, as compared to 25 years ago, you'd find that the requirements for insulation and et cetera are much, much higher than they were.

3209
05:53:34.000 --> 05:53:44.000
So most of what we're dealing with here is the retrofitting existing buildings that have been around for some time.

3210
05:53:44.000 --> 05:53:54.500
I don't think there's too much of the core money that's going to, at least on residential properties for new construction.

3211
05:53:54.500 --> 05:54:12.500
It may be, I just can't remember that level of detail on the program, if it is actually used in, like if someone was to build a factory or something, could they get money from it?

3212
05:54:12.500 --> 05:54:14.500
I just don't know.

3213
05:54:14.500 --> 05:54:23.500
But basically, the codes are updated to be much more energy efficient than they were in the past.

3214
05:54:23.500 --> 05:54:25.500
Follow up.

3215
05:54:25.500 --> 05:54:27.500
Thank you, Mr.

3216
05:54:27.500 --> 05:54:29.500
Chair.

3217
05:54:29.500 --> 05:54:31.500
Thank you, Representative Harrington.

3218
05:54:31.500 --> 05:54:45.000
And am I to assume that these updated codes, would they also be applying to any housing renovations that are being done, even though they're old houses?

3219
05:54:45.000 --> 05:54:55.500
I'm not sure about that because most of the code applications come in if you have to get a building permit.

3220
05:54:55.500 --> 05:55:01.000
And certain things require a building permit and certain things don't.

3221
05:55:01.000 --> 05:55:11.000
And if you have a building permit, then I would assume there's going to be some new requirements put in.

3222
05:55:11.000 --> 05:55:21.500
Or if you hire, I mean, unlike other states in New Hampshire, you can do your own electrical and plumbing work.

3223
05:55:21.500 --> 05:55:32.500
But if you hire a professional, I know that they may say, hey, I can only put it into the newest code.

3224
05:55:32.500 --> 05:55:39.500
So I'm going to upgrade it if you want me to do the work.

3225
05:55:39.500 --> 05:55:50.000
But I don't think that's the same for installation because I don't I don't believe those people licensed by the state.

3226
05:55:50.000 --> 05:55:52.000
Thank you.

3227
05:55:52.000 --> 05:55:57.000
Thank you representative Harrington I have another question for you.

3228
05:55:57.000 --> 05:56:53.000
Back in 2001 2002 Dutch economist Arthur van Blentham did a pioneering study on energy efficiency where he compared the gdp of about 70 different countries to their expenditures on energy efficiency and he was surprised to discover that spending money on energy efficiency kind of had the opposite effect of what he expected what he discovered was that if you save somebody $5 on their electric bill, rather than spending that on groceries or buying a new sweater or spending it on a new pair of shoes, people would instead go out and buy a new electrical device and use more electricity because they thought they were using it more efficiently.

3229
05:56:53.000 --> 05:57:02.500
Do you think that that kind of behavior still happens in the country here today and in our state?

3230
05:57:02.500 --> 05:57:29.000
Well, I certainly would think it would to some extent, but again, you've got to look at the fact that I think at this point, especially in residential properties, the majority of the money that's being used from the system benefit charge is going for thermal insulation projects to save on heating costs.

3231
05:57:29.000 --> 05:57:37.500
So it's not going to have an effect on their electric bill one way or the other.

3232
05:57:37.500 --> 05:58:03.000
And I think that generally with most people, if you get, let's just say you have a bill of $120 every month for electricity and you get some new, I don't know, a new refrigerator or you go to all sorts of LED lights or whatever and that drops to $110.

3233
05:58:03.000 --> 05:58:13.500
Yeah, probably you might spend another $10 to buy something that you wouldn't have otherwise and plug it into the wall.

3234
05:58:13.500 --> 05:58:29.500
The, you know, the thing you're going to remember about this, all these energy efficiency projects is that the most efficient use of spending money is when someone spends their own money.

3235
05:58:29.500 --> 05:58:34.500
When you're spending somebody else's money, you're never as careful.

3236
05:58:34.500 --> 05:58:41.500
I don't care how hard the bureaucrats or the people at the utilities try.

3237
05:58:41.500 --> 05:58:48.500
They're never going to be as careful as when you're spending your own money.

3238
05:58:48.500 --> 05:58:57.000
And if all these projects are so worthwhile, people would be willing to spend their own money.

3239
05:58:57.000 --> 05:59:13.500
It seems like more of an education issue from what I'm hearing that they said one of the ladies who spoke early was saying that she didn't think people were aware of it.

3240
05:59:13.500 --> 05:59:26.000
Well, I know when we were at the PUC that there was a program where people could get renewable energy, up to 100% renewable energy.

3241
05:59:26.000 --> 05:59:32.000
And the utilities spent a lot of time and effort pushing that.

3242
05:59:32.000 --> 06:00:20.000
And they actually ended up doing surveys of people and they found out well they didn't want to spend more for the renewable energy because they didn't want to spend more for energy period so I just think that's something you need to always remember here if a project is really a good idea and it's going to save money over a reasonable amount of time then people will do it and they could be convinced of doing it but when you're spending somebody else's money you're never as efficient as when you're spending your own.

3243
06:00:20.000 --> 06:00:24.000
Thank you Representative Homeless recognized for a question.

3244
06:00:24.000 --> 06:00:26.000
Yes sir thank you.

3245
06:00:26.000 --> 06:00:30.000
Yes Representative Harrington thanks for taking my question.

3246
06:00:30.000 --> 06:00:37.000
We had heard testimony prior that some of these SBS I'm sorry, excuse me.

3247
06:00:37.000 --> 06:01:13.000
i'm having a little trouble hearing you oh i'm sorry we started sliding over there a little bit more thank you is that better yes it is thank you thank you so much um we've heard that uh the systems benefit charge is is complex in the prior testimony and that's why it was recommended that the PUC be the ones that has the time to do the hard work on that.

3248
06:01:13.000 --> 06:01:24.000
And you had mentioned just a few minutes ago that it was actually a bit of a simpler process than being advertised.

3249
06:01:24.000 --> 06:01:29.500
I'm just wondering if you can give an example of that.

3250
06:01:29.500 --> 06:01:31.500
Thank you.

3251
06:01:31.500 --> 06:01:33.500
Sure.

3252
06:01:33.500 --> 06:01:35.500
Thanks for the question.

3253
06:01:35.500 --> 06:01:42.000
Well, like I say, a rate case is something that people don't understand.

3254
06:01:42.000 --> 06:01:50.000
A full-blown rate case, for example, is something that's only done every five or six years.

3255
06:01:50.000 --> 06:01:57.500
It's not like they, because rates change, that doesn't mean there's a full-blown rate case.

3256
06:01:57.500 --> 06:02:08.000
Full-blown rates case takes weeks of hearings, weeks of meetings, flying in experts from here, there, and everywhere, it seems like.

3257
06:02:08.000 --> 06:02:13.000
And it's a very, very long, drawn out technical process.

3258
06:02:13.000 --> 06:02:28.500
System benefit charge is simply a matter of saying, how much do we want to spend on low income assistance or how much we want to spend on energy efficiency projects?

3259
06:02:28.500 --> 06:03:15.500
It's a it's a it's a basically a quantitative number you come up with say, well, that's about the right amount let's spend that and see what happens and then of course you know as you build up some history on this maybe that amount gets adjusted but it's not that complicated to come up with it you can make it whatever you want and see how it works nothing like a rate case whatsoever not even close thank you thank you uh next step up is Representative Cretiens is recognized for a question.

3260
06:03:15.500 --> 06:03:17.500
Thank you, Mr.

3261
06:03:17.500 --> 06:03:21.500
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

3262
06:03:21.500 --> 06:03:38.000
I just wanted to clarify about something that you said earlier about comparing New Hampshire versus Massachusetts, and you were saying the rate on the same amount of energy is higher in Massachusetts.

3263
06:03:38.000 --> 06:03:40.000
Is that accurate?

3264
06:03:40.000 --> 06:03:59.000
Well, not exactly, but the bill itself, so that includes the energy portion, the distribution, the transmission, and any other sundry charges that they have on their bill, like we have our system benefit charge and so forth.

3265
06:03:59.000 --> 06:04:15.000
So if you use 650 kilowatt hours, which is what we take as an average in a month, and you live in eastern Massachusetts, your total bill would be about 20% higher.

3266
06:04:15.000 --> 06:04:22.000
I think that was the last I checked than it is in New Hampshire.

3267
06:04:22.000 --> 06:04:26.000
So I think that's really the incorrect comparison.

3268
06:04:26.000 --> 06:04:38.000
If you're talking about energy efficiency investments being correct, wouldn't you want to look at the same size house and see what Thank you.

3269
06:04:38.000 --> 06:04:55.500
comparison, if you're talking about energy efficiency investments being correct, wouldn't you want to look at, you know, the same size house and see what their bill is versus the same number of kilowatt hours?

3270
06:04:55.500 --> 06:04:57.500
You're holding that study.

3271
06:04:57.500 --> 06:05:27.500
Well, you could go on and make that study to be, you know, look at every house individually in the state and figure out what the cubic area was inside of it and et cetera, how many windows it had, whether it was south facing and north facing, if you're working about heat or how many, you know, how much.

3272
06:05:27.500 --> 06:05:47.000
I'm just saying that's that's if you take a typical bill and that's what we that's the figure what's been used for years or is it 650 meg kilowatt hours it would be about 20 percent higher in Massachusetts.

3273
06:05:47.000 --> 06:06:05.000
That's if you take a typical bill, and that's the figure that's been used for years, or is it 650 kilowatt hours, it would be about 20% higher in Massachusetts than it is in New Hampshire.

3274
06:06:05.000 --> 06:06:14.000
I realize that's not a perfect analogy on everything, but it's the best one I have right now.

3275
06:06:14.000 --> 06:06:20.000
But if the point of energy efficiency is to reduce that number?

3276
06:06:20.000 --> 06:06:22.000
Remember, Representative Cretchen.

3277
06:06:22.000 --> 06:06:24.000
Sorry.

3278
06:06:24.000 --> 06:06:26.000
I apologize.

3279
06:06:26.000 --> 06:06:30.500
I just was concerned I wasn't getting my answer.

3280
06:06:30.500 --> 06:06:34.500
All right, but never let it happen again.

3281
06:06:34.500 --> 06:06:38.000
Sorry, can I ask a second question?

3282
06:06:38.000 --> 06:06:42.500
Follow up, yes, as long as it's a question.

3283
06:06:42.500 --> 06:06:44.500
Sure.

3284
06:06:44.500 --> 06:07:09.500
Theorizing, if you are somebody who makes $30,000 a year and needs to spend their money on food, does that not also play into your decision of whether it's worth investing in energy efficiency versus if you're someone who makes $200,000 and has a lot more disposable income to invest?

3285
06:07:09.500 --> 06:07:11.500
I'm sure it does.

3286
06:07:11.500 --> 06:07:13.500
Okay.

3287
06:07:13.500 --> 06:07:19.500
Just wanted to make sure we were on the same page there.

3288
06:07:19.500 --> 06:07:21.500
Okay.

3289
06:07:21.500 --> 06:07:23.500
Thank you.

3290
06:07:23.500 --> 06:07:26.500
Next up would be Representative McGee.

3291
06:07:26.500 --> 06:07:28.500
Thank you, Mr.

3292
06:07:28.500 --> 06:07:30.500
Chairman.

3293
06:07:30.500 --> 06:07:56.000
I'd like to point you, Representative Harrington, to the section of your bill that's on line 13, because you had answered a question in testimony saying that the system benefits charge in terms of utility rate setting is a lot simpler than a full blown rate case, which might take weeks.

3294
06:07:56.000 --> 06:08:14.500
But this section here says that there would be an exemption for a three year energy plan that was arrived at through a full-blown process over at the Public Utilities Commission, which was just completed in December.

3295
06:08:14.500 --> 06:08:45.500
And you've removed that here from the bill so that basically that full-blown process where they did an entire analysis and came up with a plan that they would like to support with the system benefits charge, which is supposed to be exempt from oversight, as you suggest through your prior language in the bill, you're basically taking that out as well.

3296
06:08:45.500 --> 06:08:55.000
So I hope you could speak to that because I don't think you should be taking that out here.

3297
06:08:55.000 --> 06:09:13.500
I think that that exception that says that a three-year energy efficiency resource standard framework that's been established by order for 2016, 2020, and 23 should go forward basically without, you know, being delayed in any way.

3298
06:09:13.500 --> 06:09:18.000
So I'm wondering why you took that language out.

3299
06:09:18.000 --> 06:09:27.000
I took it out basically because I don't think that that's the right group to be doing this.

3300
06:09:27.000 --> 06:09:36.500
I think that the legislature should have the authority to raise what effectively is a tax on electric consumption.

3301
06:09:36.500 --> 06:09:40.000
And there's nothing wrong with the study.

3302
06:09:40.000 --> 06:09:51.500
If the legislature decided that's a great guideline, whatever that came out to be, let's put it in statute and we'll follow it.

3303
06:09:51.500 --> 06:09:55.500
I'd have no problem with looking into that.

3304
06:09:55.500 --> 06:10:05.000
But I'm saying that the authority to do that should be with the legislature and not with the PUC.

3305
06:10:05.000 --> 06:10:10.000
It's a matter of a philosophy of how we govern.

3306
06:10:10.000 --> 06:10:13.000
No, I understand it's a philosophy.

3307
06:10:13.000 --> 06:10:16.000
May I have a follow-up, Mr.

3308
06:10:16.000 --> 06:10:18.000
Chairman?

3309
06:10:18.000 --> 06:10:21.500
Follow-up, make sure it's a question, please.

3310
06:10:21.500 --> 06:10:23.500
Yeah, yeah.

3311
06:10:23.500 --> 06:10:48.500
I guess the question really is, though, that you just testified that the complex stuff is stuff that you would, this is not complex stuff, but this exception relates to a complex process that was undertaken in order to thoroughly understand what was going to be done with that money.

3312
06:10:48.500 --> 06:11:09.000
What I'm saying is, do you see the legislature as being able to replicate what they just underwent in order to figure out whether it was a good thing to go forward with a three-year plan that everybody could rely on?

3313
06:11:09.000 --> 06:11:11.000
No, not at all.

3314
06:11:11.000 --> 06:11:14.000
I don't think that's the issue.

3315
06:11:14.000 --> 06:11:17.500
I think you're missing my point here.

3316
06:11:17.500 --> 06:11:23.500
It's not that we can't have the PUC do studies on whatever.

3317
06:11:23.500 --> 06:11:35.500
It's just that when it comes to putting a tax on the electric bill, which is this, that should be done by the legislature.

3318
06:11:35.500 --> 06:12:01.000
Now, they can do that by saying, just like we do in many other bills in many other departments, you know, the Department of Environmental Services, so study the whatever, whatever, whatever, fill in the blank and report back to the legislature with a recommendation for lead limits on drinking water.

3319
06:12:01.000 --> 06:12:12.500
The same thing could be done here, but the legislature should retain the authority to put that into effect because it's a tax.

3320
06:12:12.500 --> 06:12:18.000
Well, we've had other testimony that it was a utility rate.

3321
06:12:18.000 --> 06:12:20.500
So I just, that's confusing.

3322
06:12:20.500 --> 06:12:25.500
I think in your mind, it's a tax, but yeah.

3323
06:12:25.500 --> 06:12:27.500
Okay.

3324
06:12:27.500 --> 06:12:29.500
Thanks.

3325
06:12:29.500 --> 06:13:04.000
May I suggest that since it is 422 and we have 11 more people signed up to speak on this bill, that we move on and hold questions until the next speaker would that be satisfactory to everyone okay in that case i will call on the next speaker who is mari brunner a member of the public who represents the staff of the city of keene Thank you.

3326
06:13:04.000 --> 06:13:06.500
Hi, thank you so much.

3327
06:13:06.500 --> 06:13:09.500
I'll keep my comments really brief.

3328
06:13:09.500 --> 06:13:19.500
I mostly wanted to log in today to learn more about this bill and hear what the hearing was like.

3329
06:13:19.500 --> 06:13:43.500
I am the planner for the city of Keene and I work with the city's energy and climate committee and that committee has spent a lot of time over the past couple of years working with a local group to help promote the New Hampshire Energy Saves program.

3330
06:13:43.500 --> 06:13:53.500
So I mostly logged in today because I was concerned that this bill might take funding away from that program.

3331
06:13:53.500 --> 06:14:00.000
I think it's had a lot of value to the citizens of Keene.

3332
06:14:00.000 --> 06:14:09.500
We recently held a workshop right before COVID hit actually that was very well attended with over 50 attendees.

3333
06:14:09.500 --> 06:14:17.500
And a lot of different households got their energy audit done as a result of that.

3334
06:14:17.500 --> 06:14:27.500
So I'm mostly here today in opposition to this bill, concerned that it might affect the New Hampshire Saves program.

3335
06:14:27.500 --> 06:14:29.500
So thank you.

3336
06:14:29.500 --> 06:14:32.500
That's all I had to say.

3337
06:14:32.500 --> 06:14:34.500
Okay.

3338
06:14:34.500 --> 06:14:36.500
Thank you very much.

3339
06:14:36.500 --> 06:14:38.500
Any questions for Ms.

3340
06:14:38.500 --> 06:14:40.500
Brenner?

3341
06:14:40.500 --> 06:14:43.500
Representative Cretien, you have a question?

3342
06:14:43.500 --> 06:14:45.500
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

3343
06:14:45.500 --> 06:14:49.500
My hand was still at the left hand.

3344
06:14:49.500 --> 06:14:53.500
OK, we'll move on to our next speaker.

3345
06:14:53.500 --> 06:14:58.500
Next speaker I had on the list was Dorothy Currier.

3346
06:14:58.500 --> 06:15:05.000
However, I do not see her on the list of the attendees list.

3347
06:15:05.000 --> 06:15:14.000
So I'm going to skip this Currier and move to the next speaker, who would be Anna Blake.

3348
06:15:14.000 --> 06:15:16.500
Is she on the list?

3349
06:15:16.500 --> 06:15:21.000
No, she doesn't appear to be on the list.

3350
06:15:21.000 --> 06:15:25.500
I wonder why people sign up if they don't.

3351
06:15:25.500 --> 06:15:33.500
Okay, so we'll move to the next person on the list, who would be Peter Hansel.

3352
06:15:33.500 --> 06:15:36.500
And he is here, so Mr.

3353
06:15:36.500 --> 06:15:38.500
Hansel, you are up.

3354
06:15:38.500 --> 06:15:40.500
Thank you.

3355
06:15:40.500 --> 06:15:43.000
Hopefully you can hear me.

3356
06:15:43.000 --> 06:15:45.000
I am from Keene.

3357
06:15:45.000 --> 06:15:52.500
I'm actually, I work with Mary Brunner on the Energy and Climate Committee for Keene.

3358
06:15:52.500 --> 06:16:02.500
I'm not speaking as a chairman of that committee, but I am very concerned as a private citizen in Keene.

3359
06:16:02.500 --> 06:16:16.000
And my hope is that you will keep all forms of energy in the language that is before you because we believe that energy is all related.

3360
06:16:16.000 --> 06:16:19.500
And let me give you an example.

3361
06:16:19.500 --> 06:16:32.000
Many residences and businesses have multiple forms of energy, and reducing any of those through energy efficiency measures will ultimately affect the other energy needs.

3362
06:16:32.000 --> 06:16:52.500
as described in our recently passed sustainable energy plan in Keene, we're trying to help our community, our city, residents, as well as the municipal sector, residents and businesses transition to 100% renewable energy over the next decades in the future.

3363
06:16:52.500 --> 06:17:06.500
Part of the strategy of doing that is to help them conserve energy, because that's the best way to start any kind of transition process is through conservation.

3364
06:17:06.500 --> 06:17:16.500
And if you're looking at a typical example of a house in Keene, it may be an older housing stock.

3365
06:17:16.500 --> 06:17:23.000
We have a lot of older houses in Keene with possibly oil heating.

3366
06:17:23.000 --> 06:17:37.000
And one way to start the transition process towards renewable energy is to help them save energy through weatherization or other energy saving methods, even if they're oil-heated.

3367
06:17:37.000 --> 06:17:44.000
Gradually, over time, they're going to transition away from oil heat towards something else.

3368
06:17:44.000 --> 06:17:59.500
And at this point, with the current technology, the most efficient way to do that is towards electrical heat, either through a heat pump of some sort or some other form.

3369
06:17:59.500 --> 06:18:23.000
And ultimately, the energy they save now in reducing their energy heating needs is going to save them not only construction costs in conversion to a different form of energy, but also in daily operational costs as they go down the road with their electrical heat pumps.

3370
06:18:23.000 --> 06:18:25.500
So that's just an example.

3371
06:18:25.500 --> 06:18:28.000
Businesses face the same thing.

3372
06:18:28.000 --> 06:18:48.500
I am recently retired from a business that used primarily oil heat, but several years ago made the transition towards a biomass, a wood chip boiler, with the help of some incentives that we got through the New Hampshire Saves Program.

3373
06:18:48.500 --> 06:19:02.000
So I just want to emphasize that keeping all forms of energy in this bill is important and will ultimately save electrical use in the long term.

3374
06:19:02.000 --> 06:19:16.500
One other comment on the system's benefits charge, if you can keep that as stable as possible, it allows and not make it something subject to partisan changes regularly.

3375
06:19:16.500 --> 06:19:26.500
It makes it easier for a contractor to plan for getting it, whether or not to get into that business.

3376
06:19:26.500 --> 06:19:33.000
We could use a lot more energy auditors, energy contractors in our region.

3377
06:19:33.000 --> 06:19:44.500
We have to go all the way over to the other part of the state to bring in people who are certified here.

3378
06:19:44.500 --> 06:19:59.000
And one way to encourage that is to make this, the sustainable benefits charge as stable as possible and keep the politics out of it as much as possible.

3379
06:19:59.000 --> 06:20:01.000
Thank you.

3380
06:20:01.000 --> 06:20:03.000
Okay.

3381
06:20:03.000 --> 06:20:06.500
Thank you very much for your testimony.

3382
06:20:06.500 --> 06:20:11.000
Do you need to ask a question, Representative Somsich?

3383
06:20:11.000 --> 06:20:13.000
Yes, Mr.

3384
06:20:13.000 --> 06:20:15.000
Chairman.

3385
06:20:15.000 --> 06:20:17.000
Thank you for asking.

3386
06:20:17.000 --> 06:20:34.500
Because you touched on this, I think Representative Harrington touched on this earlier too, about the fact that the energy efficiency measures don't just benefit the electric bill, but also provides efficiencies for other fuels.

3387
06:20:34.500 --> 06:20:50.500
Would it be your understanding that you would like to see the energy efficiency measures be applied also for people who use either electricity, oil, gas, or wood to heat their homes?

3388
06:20:50.500 --> 06:21:19.000
I think the way that it's applied, thank you for asking that question, I think the way that it is applied currently, where they give the New Hampshire Saves Program has the option of making energy efficiency, regardless of whether it's for electricity or oil or propane or whatever is correct, because I think they're all related.

3389
06:21:19.000 --> 06:21:23.000
Okay, Senator Thomas is recognized for a question.

3390
06:21:23.000 --> 06:21:25.000
Thank you, Mr.

3391
06:21:25.000 --> 06:21:27.000
Chair.

3392
06:21:27.000 --> 06:21:29.000
Thank you, Mr.

3393
06:21:29.000 --> 06:21:31.500
Hansel for taking my question.

3394
06:21:31.500 --> 06:21:36.000
You mentioned a desire to keep the SBC stable.

3395
06:21:36.000 --> 06:21:53.000
Would you be in favor of saying having a set price for the SBC and maybe it doesn't get touched for five or 10 years down the future so so it stays the same.

3396
06:21:53.000 --> 06:21:56.500
I am not an expert on that.

3397
06:21:56.500 --> 06:22:05.500
All I know is from my perspective, the more that we can spend on energy conservation, the better.

3398
06:22:05.500 --> 06:22:20.500
What I would not like to see is it cut, cut, and then added, and then cut, and then added, depending on what legislatures empoweratures in power at the time.

3399
06:22:20.500 --> 06:22:28.000
I think the more stability is desired and possibly increase it as time goes on.

3400
06:22:28.000 --> 06:22:30.000
Thank you.

3401
06:22:30.000 --> 06:22:39.000
You absolutely need to ask a question, Representative McGee, or can we move on to the next speaker?

3402
06:22:39.000 --> 06:22:41.500
I do have a question.

3403
06:22:41.500 --> 06:22:45.500
I do have a question for the speaker.

3404
06:22:45.500 --> 06:22:47.500
Thank you Mr.

3405
06:22:47.500 --> 06:22:49.500
Hansel.

3406
06:22:49.500 --> 06:22:55.500
You said that you're involved with the city of Keene I believe?

3407
06:22:55.500 --> 06:23:02.000
I'm on the energy and climate committee for the city of Keene yes..

3408
06:23:02.000 --> 06:23:04.000
Yes.

3409
06:23:04.000 --> 06:23:11.500
And I understand that my, my town also has an energy committee that's very active.

3410
06:23:11.500 --> 06:23:19.000
And I wondered if you could say anything about how Keene got started on that.

3411
06:23:19.000 --> 06:23:37.000
Cause I understand that actually a lot of towns are undertaking their efforts towards net zero by 2050 or whatever goals they're trying to meet because of state initiatives that asked them to undertake that planning.

3412
06:23:37.000 --> 06:23:39.000
Is that not correct?

3413
06:23:39.000 --> 06:23:41.000
Not to my knowledge.

3414
06:23:41.000 --> 06:23:46.500
I'm not familiar with that from a state point of view.

3415
06:23:46.500 --> 06:24:01.000
I know that Keene got started way back in 2004, I think, some time back there, when we joined the Cities for Climate Protection, which was a national initiative.

3416
06:24:01.000 --> 06:24:04.500
And out of that grew our committee.

3417
06:24:04.500 --> 06:24:13.000
We recently changed that committee name from Cities for Climate Protection to our Energy and Climate Committee.

3418
06:24:13.000 --> 06:24:24.000
And I think we are proud of the leadership role that we've taken in the state in taking some of these initiatives.

3419
06:24:24.000 --> 06:24:37.000
We also have a Community Power Aggregate Committee that's actively trying to get a community power program started in Keene as part of our energy plan.

3420
06:24:37.000 --> 06:24:39.500
Okay, thank you very much.

3421
06:24:39.500 --> 06:24:41.500
You're welcome.

3422
06:24:41.500 --> 06:24:43.500
Thank you.

3423
06:24:43.500 --> 06:24:55.500
I'd like to point out that we have seven more speakers who would like to speak on this bill, and we will be leaving.

3424
06:24:55.500 --> 06:25:02.500
We will be closing this public hearing and leaving no later than five o'clock.

3425
06:25:02.500 --> 06:25:12.000
The reports coming in from the weather south of us indicate that there is fairly heavy snow building up.

3426
06:25:12.000 --> 06:25:24.500
So for people who have to drive home, we want to get them out of here and an hour that allows them to get home.

3427
06:25:24.500 --> 06:25:27.000
And a decent hour themselves.

3428
06:25:27.000 --> 06:25:37.000
So next up, provided I can find her on the list here, is Emily Manns, a member of the public.

3429
06:25:37.000 --> 06:25:46.500
But I do not see her, so we move on to the next speaker after that who is Mr.

3430
06:25:46.500 --> 06:26:02.000
Chair could you ask Mari Bruner and Peter Hansel to mute now that they've completed their testimony we're getting echo at least I am I'm getting an echo through the system.

3431
06:26:02.000 --> 06:26:04.000
Okay.

3432
06:26:04.000 --> 06:26:06.000
I'll take care.

3433
06:26:06.000 --> 06:26:08.000
Donna Reardon.

3434
06:26:08.000 --> 06:26:13.000
Is there a Donna Reardon who would like to speak?

3435
06:26:13.000 --> 06:26:17.500
I have a Donna here with no last name.

3436
06:26:17.500 --> 06:26:24.000
I will allow her to speak and hope that she is Donna Reardon.

3437
06:26:24.000 --> 06:26:26.000
Go ahead and speak.

3438
06:26:26.000 --> 06:26:28.500
Don't forget to unmute yourself.

3439
06:26:28.500 --> 06:26:35.500
You know, one of the Donnas has a last name, but this one doesn't.

3440
06:26:35.500 --> 06:26:38.500
But apparently she is not there.

3441
06:26:38.500 --> 06:26:41.000
So we will move on.

3442
06:26:41.000 --> 06:26:45.500
Next up would be the other Donna, Donna Gamache.

3443
06:26:45.500 --> 06:26:47.500
Hey Donna.

3444
06:26:47.500 --> 06:26:51.000
So we just allow Donna to speak.

3445
06:26:51.000 --> 06:26:53.000
And Ms.

3446
06:26:53.000 --> 06:26:55.000
Gamache, you are on.

3447
06:26:55.000 --> 06:26:57.000
Thank you very much.

3448
06:26:57.000 --> 06:27:02.500
Nice to see as many of you that I can see.

3449
06:27:02.500 --> 06:27:08.500
Thanks very much for the opportunity to provide some comments this afternoon.

3450
06:27:08.500 --> 06:27:15.000
For the record, I'm Donna Gamache, Director of Government Affairs for Eversource Energy.

3451
06:27:15.000 --> 06:27:26.500
And if it's at all possible, I also wanted to introduce Kate Peters, who runs these programs for Eversource, these energy efficiency programs.

3452
06:27:26.500 --> 06:27:28.500
And she has expertise.

3453
06:27:28.500 --> 06:27:43.000
She could say a few words in a few minutes, but also answer any of your questions that you have that are specific to the programs, if that's okay.

3454
06:27:43.000 --> 06:27:47.000
But I'll be very, very brief before that.

3455
06:27:47.000 --> 06:28:05.500
You've heard enough today about how and when this legislature created the system benefits charge to do two things, to provide payment assistance to low-income customers and for programs to assist customers in lowering their electric usage.

3456
06:28:05.500 --> 06:28:21.500
The programs started out very small and have evolved over the years as new technology has become available and as our customers' needs have developed and then also policy priorities have changed.

3457
06:28:21.500 --> 06:29:16.500
We're proud to have come this far, and we continue to participate in rigorous reviews by our regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, and we also look forward to, this is just, this is sort of in my closing, we're looking forward to working with you um the sponsor and the committee to see if we could all find a way to ensure that we could come up with some language that provides the transparency um that you're all looking for that is appropriate which we think is appropriate um with a view on the programs the benefits and the costs so in a way that doesn't slow down these programs.

3458
06:29:16.500 --> 06:29:31.500
So anyway, I just wanted to say that we're committed to trying to bridge the bridge between the two and we're happy to be creative and come up with something.

3459
06:29:31.500 --> 06:29:41.500
But with that, if it's okay, I'd love to turn it over to Kate Peters, if you don't mind, Mr.

3460
06:29:41.500 --> 06:29:44.000
Chairman, if that'd be possible.

3461
06:29:44.000 --> 06:29:46.000
Yes, that's okay.

3462
06:29:46.000 --> 06:29:48.000
Thank you.

3463
06:29:48.000 --> 06:29:53.500
She's going to use your microphone or do I have to?

3464
06:29:53.500 --> 06:29:57.000
I think she has to be unmuted.

3465
06:29:57.000 --> 06:29:59.500
She's there, but I can't.

3466
06:29:59.500 --> 06:30:03.000
We're not in the same room, unfortunately.

3467
06:30:03.000 --> 06:30:06.500
I'm sorry to give you this issue.

3468
06:30:06.500 --> 06:30:09.500
I did not intend for that.

3469
06:30:09.500 --> 06:30:11.500
I see her now.

3470
06:30:11.500 --> 06:30:13.500
Okay.

3471
06:30:13.500 --> 06:30:15.500
Ms.

3472
06:30:15.500 --> 06:30:17.500
Peters, you are on.

3473
06:30:17.500 --> 06:30:19.500
Hello.

3474
06:30:19.500 --> 06:30:21.500
Thank you so much.

3475
06:30:21.500 --> 06:30:23.500
Can you hear me?

3476
06:30:23.500 --> 06:30:25.500
Yes.

3477
06:30:25.500 --> 06:30:27.500
Thank you.

3478
06:30:27.500 --> 06:30:32.500
Just a couple additions to what Donna had to say.

3479
06:30:32.500 --> 06:30:48.500
I think we always, when we are writing plans and going before the commission, want to understand and make sure that we are following the state's policy priorities, which the legislature sets.

3480
06:30:48.500 --> 06:31:10.000
And to the extent that we can understand those priorities before and while we are writing the plan, rather than kind of writing the plan and doing all the work to develop it and then coming back afterwards for potential changes in direction.

3481
06:31:10.000 --> 06:31:18.000
I think that's where some of the administrative difficulties that others have been talking about come.

3482
06:31:18.000 --> 06:31:20.000
It creates uncertainty.

3483
06:31:20.000 --> 06:31:34.500
So it's very helpful for us to know what we are aiming to do as we are developing it rather than having that potentially changed after we've developed it.

3484
06:31:34.500 --> 06:31:51.000
I did also want to note that the fuel neutral aspects of our program where we're doing weatherization for fuel oil and propane, we've been doing that for our low-income customers since 2001.

3485
06:31:51.000 --> 06:32:12.000
That is the primary energy use in those low-income customers' homes, and to provide benefit for them and reduce their use of other fuel heating subsidies, that's been seen as a priority, I think, by a wide variety of policymakers and regulators.

3486
06:32:12.000 --> 06:32:21.000
We've been providing those weatherization services for our kind of standard residential customers, not low income, since 2012.

3487
06:32:21.000 --> 06:32:32.000
So for many years now, there's a contractor base of 20 to 30 small businesses in the state that do this work.

3488
06:32:32.000 --> 06:32:37.500
They are, for the most part, small businesses owned by individuals.

3489
06:32:37.500 --> 06:32:46.500
They employ several hundred employees across the state in well-paying and skilled jobs to do this weatherization work.

3490
06:32:46.500 --> 06:32:58.500
And so I think there would be some pretty big impacts if we were to shift away from being able to provide those services.

3491
06:32:58.500 --> 06:33:03.000
And they're also very well desired by our customers.

3492
06:33:03.000 --> 06:33:07.500
These are very popular programs with our residential customers.

3493
06:33:07.500 --> 06:33:13.500
We do balance them out with significant efforts to reduce electricity use.

3494
06:33:13.500 --> 06:33:50.500
As Representative Harrington said, that is our primary goal for the programs our commercial programs focus on that almost exclusively but the fuel neutral aspect there has been a very important part for our residential customers so i just wanted to provide a little more background on that and i've heard a couple questions that that i could probably speak to but i i don't want to presume and so i'll leave it there.

3495
06:33:50.500 --> 06:33:58.000
And if you have any questions that I could answer, I will happily do so.

3496
06:33:58.000 --> 06:34:00.000
Thank you, Ms.

3497
06:34:00.000 --> 06:34:02.000
Peters.

3498
06:34:02.000 --> 06:34:06.000
Does anybody have a burning question for Ms.

3499
06:34:06.000 --> 06:34:08.000
Peters or Ms.

3500
06:34:08.000 --> 06:34:10.000
Kamash?

3501
06:34:10.000 --> 06:34:13.500
Representative Kelly Vitz, don't forget to unmute.

3502
06:34:13.500 --> 06:34:21.000
I don't know if it's a burning question, but I would like to ask Ms.

3503
06:34:21.000 --> 06:34:35.000
Peters, in this time of COVID, in just these nine months, do you know if your requests have gone up because people are having a more difficult time?

3504
06:34:35.000 --> 06:34:37.500
Yes, that's a great question.

3505
06:34:37.500 --> 06:34:43.500
So in 2020, we actually saw more demand from our residential customers.

3506
06:34:43.500 --> 06:34:48.500
We overachieved our residential goals because people were at home.

3507
06:34:48.500 --> 06:34:53.000
They were thinking about their energy use at home.

3508
06:34:53.000 --> 06:34:59.500
They were interested in projects that they could do to improve their homes.

3509
06:34:59.500 --> 06:35:14.500
We saw in 2020 more difficulty for some of the business customers who were dealing with a lot of different scenarios and sometimes their priorities were focused in other areas.

3510
06:35:14.500 --> 06:35:28.000
But we are seeing some strong demand from commercial customers going into 2021 as they're all anticipating kind of how they're gonna manage their future business plans.

3511
06:35:28.000 --> 06:35:30.500
So thank you very much.

3512
06:35:30.500 --> 06:35:32.500
Thank you.

3513
06:35:32.500 --> 06:35:34.500
Any additional questions?

3514
06:35:34.500 --> 06:35:38.000
Seeing none, we will now move on.

3515
06:35:38.000 --> 06:35:40.000
Whoops.

3516
06:35:40.000 --> 06:35:42.000
There is one.

3517
06:35:42.000 --> 06:35:45.500
Representative Harrington is recognized for a question.

3518
06:35:45.500 --> 06:35:47.500
I think I'm unmuted.

3519
06:35:47.500 --> 06:35:49.500
Yeah.

3520
06:35:49.500 --> 06:35:51.500
This is from Ms.

3521
06:35:51.500 --> 06:35:53.500
Gamache.

3522
06:35:53.500 --> 06:36:01.000
What is the estimate for the total spending for the core fund for this year?

3523
06:36:01.000 --> 06:36:03.000
How many millions?

3524
06:36:03.000 --> 06:36:10.000
You know, that's why I brought Kate here because she's closer to the numbers.

3525
06:36:10.000 --> 06:36:16.000
Would you mind if I handed that over to Kate to answer?

3526
06:36:16.000 --> 06:36:18.000
Absolutely not.

3527
06:36:18.000 --> 06:36:20.000
Thank you.

3528
06:36:20.000 --> 06:36:28.000
So right now we are on a continuation of the 2020 budget levels for the programs.

3529
06:36:28.000 --> 06:36:37.500
And I actually don't have it right in front of me, but I believe it is around $63 million.

3530
06:36:37.500 --> 06:36:42.000
That's for all the utilities combined, not just Eversource.

3531
06:36:42.000 --> 06:36:44.000
All right, thank you.

3532
06:36:44.000 --> 06:36:46.000
Okay, Representative Oxum.

3533
06:36:46.000 --> 06:36:48.000
Thank you very much.

3534
06:36:48.000 --> 06:36:50.000
Ms.

3535
06:36:50.000 --> 06:36:54.500
Peters, could you help me with the other aspect?

3536
06:36:54.500 --> 06:36:58.000
You've done a great job for us.

3537
06:36:58.000 --> 06:37:08.000
Thank you so much in talking've been talking about how the benefits to the customer who actually gets the upgrade.

3538
06:37:08.000 --> 06:37:37.500
But I had the larger interest, which goes to the fact that we get payments from the forward capacity market also for energy efficiency, because we're reducing peak demand, peak demand being such a costly part of our of our bills and really driving the cost, because that's the moment at which we have to pay the highest prices.

3539
06:37:37.500 --> 06:37:44.500
Could you speak to how energy efficiency benefits everyone by reducing the peak demand?

3540
06:37:44.500 --> 06:37:46.500
Certainly.

3541
06:37:46.500 --> 06:37:52.500
So energy efficiency, reducing electric use overall does also reduce peak usage.

3542
06:37:52.500 --> 06:38:00.000
And so all of our standard electric reduction offerings also lower use on peak days.

3543
06:38:00.000 --> 06:38:22.000
We also have a set of programs called active demand programs, which are designed specifically to work with customers to reduce usage on those highest use days in the summer, where the high prices are being set for the regional market for the year.

3544
06:38:22.000 --> 06:38:26.500
And those have been pilots the past two years.

3545
06:38:26.500 --> 06:38:28.500
We've had great enrollment.

3546
06:38:28.500 --> 06:38:32.000
We actually were just at a meeting.

3547
06:38:32.000 --> 06:38:36.500
We had a wait list for Eversource commercial customers.

3548
06:38:36.500 --> 06:38:44.500
43, I'm sorry, we had 87 customers that wanted to participate this summer, large commercial entities.

3549
06:38:44.500 --> 06:38:49.500
We were only able to sign up 43 of them.

3550
06:38:49.500 --> 06:38:53.000
So there's more that could be done.

3551
06:38:53.000 --> 06:39:03.500
And when you reduce use on those peak days, you are lowering the peak needs of the system as a whole.

3552
06:39:03.500 --> 06:39:09.000
And so there are benefits to the system as a whole.

3553
06:39:09.000 --> 06:39:15.000
And that's kind of my layman's explanation of it, if that's helpful.

3554
06:39:15.000 --> 06:39:17.000
Follow up, Mr.

3555
06:39:17.000 --> 06:39:19.000
Chair?

3556
06:39:19.000 --> 06:39:21.000
Follow up.

3557
06:39:21.000 --> 06:39:37.000
Could you give us just, I know it's a ballpark estimate, but would you say that the savings when you can cut down peak demand could be in the millions of dollars?

3558
06:39:37.000 --> 06:39:39.000
Yes, certainly.

3559
06:39:39.000 --> 06:39:49.500
We looked at in our three-year plan creation, we did a study that looked at the cost requirement for the utilities.

3560
06:39:49.500 --> 06:40:01.500
So our overall system costs and the impact that the energy efficiency from the plan would have on those revenue requirements for the system.

3561
06:40:01.500 --> 06:40:12.000
And we found that there was a more than $300 million positive impact on the overall revenue requirements for the utility.

3562
06:40:12.000 --> 06:40:20.500
So the implementation of the efficiency measures lower the revenue requirements, the system costs for the utilities.

3563
06:40:20.500 --> 06:40:31.500
And the study that we did for the plan, it was the exact numbers escaping me, but it was over $300 million.

3564
06:40:31.500 --> 06:40:34.000
Thank you so very much.

3565
06:40:34.000 --> 06:40:36.000
Okay.

3566
06:40:36.000 --> 06:40:38.000
Thank you, Ms.

3567
06:40:38.000 --> 06:40:40.000
Peters.

3568
06:40:40.000 --> 06:40:56.500
We'd like to call on our next presenter, who is the fount of all knowledge regarding things having to do with the energy systems in the electricity sector and the Public Utilities Commission.

3569
06:40:56.500 --> 06:41:01.000
That is New Hampshire's own consumer advocate, Don Kreitz.

3570
06:41:01.000 --> 06:41:03.000
Don, you are on.

3571
06:41:03.000 --> 06:41:05.000
Good afternoon, everybody.

3572
06:41:05.000 --> 06:41:18.500
That is the most flattering and complimentary introduction I have ever received anywhere, and certainly anywhere in the halls, whether virtual or real, of the state legislature.

3573
06:41:18.500 --> 06:41:23.500
But I'm going to leap right into my substantive testimony.

3574
06:41:23.500 --> 06:41:37.500
With all due respect to my friend, Representative Harrington, with whom I go back many years, I do not agree that the system benefits charge is a tax.

3575
06:41:37.500 --> 06:41:41.000
It is not collected by the government.

3576
06:41:41.000 --> 06:41:44.500
It is not remitted to the government.

3577
06:41:44.500 --> 06:41:52.500
The government never has custody of the money, and the government does not spend the money.

3578
06:41:52.500 --> 06:41:57.000
Ergo, the system benefits charge is not a tax.

3579
06:41:57.000 --> 06:42:11.500
It is a rate, which is to say it is a charge approved by the Public Utilities Commission that pays for a service from utility customers to their customers.

3580
06:42:11.500 --> 06:42:23.500
I have a heretical thing to say about why it is better for the PUC to make this decision rather than the general court.

3581
06:42:23.500 --> 06:42:35.500
Your committee, House Committee on Science, Tech and Energy, has, I would contend, more expertise on it collectively than the Public Utilities Commission has.

3582
06:42:35.500 --> 06:42:49.000
Because I know many of you, and there is a great deal of knowledge, including the fact that you have a former PUC commissioner on the committee.

3583
06:42:49.000 --> 06:43:01.500
So really, it is just a matter of whether you have the time to conduct the kind of analysis that you would need to conduct.

3584
06:43:01.500 --> 06:43:18.500
Now, again, I have to respectfully disagree with my friend, Representative Harrington, about the complexity of the task of determining what system benefits charge is adequate to the task of paying for energy efficiency.

3585
06:43:18.500 --> 06:43:38.000
If you look at what the utilities filed with the PUC on September 1st in support of their triennial plan and requested SBC levels, you will see a filing that is, I believe, well in excess of 400 pages.

3586
06:43:38.000 --> 06:44:02.500
And most of that filing is very detailed schedules that support all the calculations that drive creating an energy efficiency resource standard that sets savings goals and establishes savings programs and provides for monitoring, evaluation and verification and sets the SBC and related gas charges at the appropriate levels.

3587
06:44:02.500 --> 06:44:16.500
You know, Representative Harrington referred to just throwing money at energy efficiency programs, and it really isn't true that anybody is doing any throwing of any money anywhere.

3588
06:44:16.500 --> 06:44:26.000
In fact, I don't know of money that is more rigorously evaluated for the cost effectiveness of its spending.

3589
06:44:26.000 --> 06:44:36.000
We have an excellent cost effectiveness test that we began applying here in New Hampshire at the beginning of 2020.

3590
06:44:36.000 --> 06:44:43.500
It requires every program in the EERS to save money for customers as a group.

3591
06:44:43.500 --> 06:44:53.500
So it doesn't take into account the benefits to the individual customers who get the measures installed on their premises.

3592
06:44:53.500 --> 06:44:56.500
Rather, it focuses on all ratepayers.

3593
06:44:56.500 --> 06:44:58.500
That is very important.

3594
06:44:58.500 --> 06:45:10.500
There were some points made about electricity bills paid by customers in Massachusetts versus electricity bills paid for by customers here in New Hampshire.

3595
06:45:10.500 --> 06:45:22.000
And it is true that Massachusetts is the number two state for energy efficiency, whereas New Hampshire, I believe, is number 18 now.

3596
06:45:22.000 --> 06:45:25.000
So we're last in the region.

3597
06:45:25.000 --> 06:45:35.500
But it is not fair to suggest that Massachusetts electricity bills are higher because they have such excellent energy efficiency programs.

3598
06:45:35.500 --> 06:45:51.500
Massachusetts also has a lot of public policy that requires purchases of renewable energy for which customers arguably pay twice in Massachusetts because of the way the regional market rules are crafted.

3599
06:45:51.500 --> 06:45:56.000
Now, I'm not here to analyze Massachusetts's electricity costs.

3600
06:45:56.000 --> 06:46:08.000
I'm just here to say that comparing them on a rote basis, on a simplistic basis, to our electricity costs is not really helpful.

3601
06:46:08.000 --> 06:46:23.000
Finally, I just want to say that it is not my understanding that the electric utilities were dragged kicking and screaming to the job of administering our energy efficiency programs.

3602
06:46:23.000 --> 06:46:47.500
Not only are they enthusiastic about it now, but I believe they were enthusiastic about it right around the turn of the century when they participated in the energy efficiency working group that came out of the restructuring settlement agreement that launched restructuring at the turn of the century.

3603
06:46:47.500 --> 06:47:12.500
And the utilities were strong proponents of what began as the core programs, and they are strong proponents today of the energy efficiency resource standard, which is all about setting savings goals that are appropriate, appropriately ambitious, and then making sure that we have the money to pay for them.

3604
06:47:12.500 --> 06:47:19.000
Beyond that, in the interest of time, I submitted written testimony earlier today.

3605
06:47:19.000 --> 06:47:23.000
I earnestly commend it to your reading pleasure.

3606
06:47:23.000 --> 06:47:25.000
Thank you, Mr.

3607
06:47:25.000 --> 06:47:27.000
Kreese.

3608
06:47:27.000 --> 06:47:30.500
We appreciate your testimony, written and verbal.

3609
06:47:30.500 --> 06:47:36.000
And if any members of the committee need to ask Mr.

3610
06:47:36.000 --> 06:47:41.000
Kreese any questions, I suggest you give him a call.

3611
06:47:41.000 --> 06:47:46.000
He's always available and very willing to chat with anyone.

3612
06:47:46.000 --> 06:47:48.000
Indeed.

3613
06:47:48.000 --> 06:47:56.500
We'll now call on our last speaker of the day, and that is Huck Montgomery from Liberty.

3614
06:47:56.500 --> 06:47:58.500
And Mr.

3615
06:47:58.500 --> 06:48:03.500
Montgomery, you have exactly five minutes to make your presentation.

3616
06:48:03.500 --> 06:48:05.500
Thank you.

3617
06:48:05.500 --> 06:48:07.500
That's wonderful.

3618
06:48:07.500 --> 06:48:09.500
Thank you, Mr.

3619
06:48:09.500 --> 06:48:11.500
Chairman.

3620
06:48:11.500 --> 06:48:13.500
Just a quick check.

3621
06:48:13.500 --> 06:48:16.000
Can everybody hear me okay?

3622
06:48:16.000 --> 06:48:18.000
Yes.

3623
06:48:18.000 --> 06:48:20.000
Great.

3624
06:48:20.000 --> 06:48:23.500
Well, thanks so much for the record.

3625
06:48:23.500 --> 06:48:25.500
It's Huck Montgomery.

3626
06:48:25.500 --> 06:48:30.000
I'm the Director of Government Affairs for Liberty Utilities.

3627
06:48:30.000 --> 06:48:41.500
Now going by Liberty, so you'll look for some exciting changes in our logo when you see our trucks on the road soon.

3628
06:48:41.500 --> 06:48:49.000
I just want to say here today that Liberty is opposed to House Bill 351.

3629
06:48:49.000 --> 06:49:06.000
And that really is because we stand unequivocally behind the 2021-2023 triennial plan, which is before the Public Utility Commission today, and on which they're expected to rule before the end of the month.

3630
06:49:06.000 --> 06:49:23.500
That plan was developed through an exhaustive collaborative process that includes robust public input, input from a diverse array of stakeholders, and was recommended to the commission unanimously by the EERS committee, which reviews it.

3631
06:49:23.500 --> 06:49:30.500
The plan, the settlement agreement was unanimously supported by the parties at the PUC.

3632
06:49:30.500 --> 06:49:38.500
And we think that the plan that is before the PUC now is a great plan.

3633
06:49:38.500 --> 06:49:47.000
That's going to save our customers substantial amounts of money on their bill over the long run.

3634
06:49:47.000 --> 06:49:52.500
It's going to be a really beneficial thing to see implemented.

3635
06:49:52.500 --> 06:50:08.000
And what this bill would do substantively with regard to legislative scrutiny of plans is very simply to subject the plan that was produced over the course of the last year.

3636
06:50:08.000 --> 06:50:19.500
And as before the Public Utilities Commission at this time for their final approval to legislative scrutiny, to the approval of the legislature.

3637
06:50:19.500 --> 06:50:21.500
But that's it.

3638
06:50:21.500 --> 06:50:24.500
Very narrowly, that's what it does.

3639
06:50:24.500 --> 06:50:37.000
It takes the plan that we have worked really hard on, that we are very proud of, and that was developed pursuant to current law.

3640
06:50:37.000 --> 06:50:45.500
And it adds a new level of approval that wasn't anticipated as the plan was being crafted.

3641
06:50:45.500 --> 06:51:01.000
So it's important to note that all future system benefits charge increases due to EERS, future EERS plans are already going to be subject to legislative approval according to current law.

3642
06:51:01.000 --> 06:51:43.500
So what we're talking about here is should the work that Kate, our energy efficiency manager, Eric Stanley, our counterparts at Unitel, and everyone has been working so hard on over the last year, which was universally recognized by the stakeholders who were involved in the creation of it, which include representatives from the business community, from the environmental community, and everywhere in between, they all really supported this and said that this is the best way for us to achieve all cost-effective energy efficiency.

3643
06:51:43.500 --> 06:52:00.500
We would be putting that instead before the legislature for it to sign off on, regardless of whether the PUC found that it met the requirements under the law that it was developed under.

3644
06:52:00.500 --> 06:52:05.000
So we urge you to reject House Bill 351.

3645
06:52:05.000 --> 06:52:07.500
We think that it's unnecessary.

3646
06:52:07.500 --> 06:52:13.000
The future EERS plans would certainly fall under legislative purview anyway.

3647
06:52:13.000 --> 06:52:20.000
And the plan that's before the Public Utility Commission now is a fantastic one.

3648
06:52:20.000 --> 06:52:35.000
Remember, all spending under that plan must be found to be cost effective by the Public Utilities Commission in that it would net more savings than you put into it.

3649
06:52:35.000 --> 06:52:49.000
A long-term revenue requirement reduction number, meaning what does this save you over the long run is 1.36% on your electric bill and 2.27% on your gas bill.

3650
06:52:49.000 --> 06:52:51.000
That's where that's going.

3651
06:52:51.000 --> 06:52:54.500
And we think that's a good thing.

3652
06:52:54.500 --> 06:53:02.000
And I would just want to reiterate as I close here that to quote Mr.

3653
06:53:02.000 --> 06:53:10.000
Kreese, this is actually the word that I had written down on my notes as well.

3654
06:53:10.000 --> 06:53:28.500
The utilities and speaking for Liberty, we are enthusiastic about being the program administrators of the utility programs here, and we're excited to see, hopefully, this EERS plan that's before the Public Utilities Commission now be implemented.

3655
06:53:28.500 --> 06:53:30.500
Thank you, Mr.

3656
06:53:30.500 --> 06:53:32.500
Chairman.

3657
06:53:32.500 --> 06:53:35.000
Happy to take any questions.

3658
06:53:35.000 --> 06:53:37.000
Thank you very much.

3659
06:53:37.000 --> 06:53:41.000
Unfortunately, we don't have time for any questions.

3660
06:53:41.000 --> 06:53:54.500
I will report that on HB 315, or 351, I should say, three people signed in to support the bill, 46 signed in to oppose the bill.

3661
06:53:54.500 --> 06:53:59.000
So that closes the public hearing on HB 351.

3662
06:53:59.000 --> 06:54:04.500
The next committee session will be on Monday, February the 8th.

3663
06:54:04.500 --> 06:54:10.000
The session after that will be on Friday, February the 8th.

3664
06:54:10.000 --> 06:54:15.500
The session after that will be on Friday, February the 19th.

3665
06:54:15.500 --> 06:54:22.000
So use that for your planning purposes for the upcoming couple of weeks.

3666
06:54:22.000 --> 06:54:33.500
It's possible we may get a date before the 19th, but as of today, the 19th was the next available date to us.

3667
06:54:33.500 --> 06:54:35.500
So with us.

3668
06:54:35.500 --> 06:54:38.500
So with that, I will- Mr.

3669
06:54:38.500 --> 06:54:40.500
Chairman, Mr.

3670
06:54:40.500 --> 06:54:44.500
Chairman, can I ask a question of you?

3671
06:54:44.500 --> 06:54:49.000
Reports, minority reports and other reports, they're due tomorrow.

3672
06:54:49.000 --> 06:54:51.000
Is that correct?

3673
06:54:51.000 --> 06:54:53.000
Yes, that is correct.

3674
06:54:53.000 --> 06:54:56.500
By what time or any particular time?

3675
06:54:56.500 --> 06:54:59.000
Three o'clock in the afternoon.

3676
06:54:59.000 --> 06:55:01.000
Okay.

3677
06:55:01.000 --> 06:55:03.000
Thank you very much.

3678
06:55:03.000 --> 06:55:05.000
Mr.

3679
06:55:05.000 --> 06:55:07.500
Chairman also, if I may.

3680
06:55:07.500 --> 06:55:09.500
Yes, Mr.

3681
06:55:09.500 --> 06:55:11.500
Vincent.

3682
06:55:11.500 --> 06:55:13.500
Thank you.

3683
06:55:13.500 --> 06:55:16.500
So today's meeting was at 10.

3684
06:55:16.500 --> 06:55:21.500
And I know there was some talk that was earlier.

3685
06:55:21.500 --> 06:55:25.500
Is it still going to be at 10?

3686
06:55:25.500 --> 06:55:37.500
Our Monday meetings will start at 10 because at 9 o'clock, there's a leadership meeting that Representative Thomas and I have to go to.

3687
06:55:37.500 --> 06:55:40.500
That's fine, I just want clarification.

3688
06:55:40.500 --> 06:55:43.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

3689
06:55:43.000 --> 06:55:45.000
Chairman.

3690
06:55:45.000 --> 06:55:47.000
You're very welcome.

3691
06:55:47.000 --> 06:55:54.000
And thank you all, have a wonderful week and we'll see you next Monday.

3692
06:55:54.000 --> 06:55:56.000
You too, thank you.

3693
06:55:56.000 --> 06:55:58.000
Drive safely, everyone.

3694
06:55:58.000 --> 06:56:00.000
Yes.
