00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
would just add that uh even if the
 
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
moderator isn't
 
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
technically counting the ballots when
 
00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
the accu vote machines are being used
 
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
the moderator
 
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
will get involved perhaps in the hand
 
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 align:start position:0%
count of ballots certainly the
 
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
processing of absentee ballots
 
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe making rulings on the
 
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the voter in
 
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
in ballots that some of the election
 
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
officials might have questions on when
 
00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
tallying them
 
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the name badge certainly is is a
 
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.029 align:start position:0%
um the name badge certainly is is a
consideration

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
um and it's a
 
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer i don't have an
 
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer i don't have an
answer

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian thank you madam
 
00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.110 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian thank you madam
chair

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
um and again it it seems as though we
 
00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
maybe don't have a clear solution
 
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
forward on this
 
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
but just to reiterate some of the
 
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
problems the um
 
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know in a town election some um any
 
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
selectmen that are up for reelection or
 
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
or anybody that's running
 
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
i would have to be up for re-election
 
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to to
 
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
um in our town i know if this happens
 
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.670 align:start position:0%
um in our town i know if this happens
everywhere

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
to participate in in work a shift during
 
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
the polls
 
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
when they were on the ballot so it seems
 
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.870 align:start position:0%
when they were on the ballot so it seems
to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know and then and that's for a good
 
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
reason so it seems like we should carry
 
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.149 align:start position:0%
reason so it seems like we should carry
it

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
a step further with the moderator
 
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
however in my district in one of my
 
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.710 align:start position:0%
however in my district in one of my
towns

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
both the moderator and the assistant
 
00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
moderator are both
 
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
current state reps so but so if you said
 
00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 align:start position:0%
okay the moderator can't do it well
 
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
the assistant moderator is also a wrap
 
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
it's problematic i i too would like to
 
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
find a way forward on this but i don't
 
00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 align:start position:0%
know that this
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
this part one of sb 83s is
 
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative as i
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
as i listen to uh more experienced you
 
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
know committee members discuss this i
 
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.710 align:start position:0%
know committee members discuss this i
guess

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm my takeaway is that there's a
 
00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
benefit to excluding moderators
 
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
um it eliminates a conflict of interest
 
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
it eliminates an unfair advantage and
 
00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
maybe most important it eliminates the
 
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
perception of an unfair advantage
 
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
but there's also a cost in that a lot of
 
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
but there's also a cost in that a lot of
moderators

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
moderators
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
who also happen to be maybe candidates
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
for state rep
 
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
are among the most experienced election
 
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
officials that towns have
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
and and so we're just weighing this
 
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
benefit in the cost and and i'm trying
 
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
to get my mind around
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know how big a cost that is um and
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
anyone who can speak to that
 
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
you know i'd be grateful to hear from
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
um you know are there a lot of state
 
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
reps who are moderators are there a lot
 
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
of towns that would suffer if we
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
disallowed um state rep slash moderators
 
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.470 align:start position:0%
disallowed um state rep slash moderators
from

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
participating in the administration of
 
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
an election
 
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
how big is this cost and i don't i know
 
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
no one may be able to answer it but i'm
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
just that that's what i'm trying to
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
wrap my mind around as i'm weighing the
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
i see that deputy scanlon is still
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
online with us and i guess if
 
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
he would be willing i'd i'd like him to
 
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
he would be willing i'd i'd like him to
answer

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
from as to your
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
office how often has this
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
issue been raised by members of the
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
public with concern
 
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair every election we hear
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
local election officials working the
 
00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.350 align:start position:0%
local election officials working the
polls

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
polls
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes when they're running for the
 
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
same office but certainly
 
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
when they're running for an office other
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
than an election official
 
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i mean people feel
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
different ways about that and
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
and there are perception issues that are
 
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.869 align:start position:0%
and there are perception issues that are
involved

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
and you know when we train local
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
election officials we do everything we
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
can to make them aware
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
of uh you know those potential
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
perception issues that might be out
 
00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
there while they're doing their job
 
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
and as has been discussed by the
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee this has been
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
a subject uh not just this year but
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know as representative bergeron said
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's been no resolution
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
to you know how to
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh easily address the concerns
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
the one thought i guess i would convey
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
is that these individuals uh
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
that are serving as moderators or
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist that
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know hold other positions um and
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of state reps
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh that are also moderators uh currently
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
is that they are elected by the people
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
in their town or in their ward and those
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
positions are usually ones
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
that command respect um
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the officials are chosen based on
 
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
the the officials are chosen based on
their

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
integrity and honesty and and
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the voters decision that they're
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
capable of doing the job
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
and and you know every example that i
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
can think of
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
that where a current state rep also
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
serves as a moderator
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think they're all excellent examples
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
running for an office but also doing
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
their job
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
as an election official and and even
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
though there's
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
you know this issue comes up but you
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
know every
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
every biennium uh we seem to get through
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not aware of any real
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
scandals that are out there
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
that i can cite as examples of you know
 
00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
this process going awry
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
because of conflicts beyond that you
 
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
because of conflicts beyond that you
know

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't have any answers on you know
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
how to
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative hamer do you have your
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
or do i have my cursor over your screen
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think we understand the issue and it's
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
an issue representative
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
your head well i just i would propose
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
for people to consider that if it really
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
is a vexing question and it's been
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's been dogging people you know for 50
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
rep our esteemed colleague
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
representative virgin for
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
five decades you know maybe rather than
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
pass the bill in its per current state
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
we should um
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
we should take this little one part of
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
it and study it uh just a little bit
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
longer and
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
and get a sense of how many people are
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
talking about how many times be affected
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and and just get a more precise
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
of what the effects of this would be for
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
towns in the state
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that's the right course
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
all right i just um thank you for
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
raising that because it brings up two
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
points that are my understanding of
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with these omnibus bills
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
just so you know we cannot separate the
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
parts out
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
they remain in the final
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
vote on what will be sb
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
83 now amended by the senate
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
possibly amended by the house so
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're considering say part one is a
 
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.710 align:start position:0%
you're considering say part one is a
study

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
it needs to be contained an amendment
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
within the bill
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
and cannot be retained or dealt with
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
separately it it is part of the whole
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
package which is part of why i wanted to
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
have this work session
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
so that people understood when
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
amendments come forward you're dealing
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
that part and you can make a motion to
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to delete a part
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
so you understand that's valid so you
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
can delete amend or leave a part in
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
we can't create a new bill
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just wanted to
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
say you you've had a good historical
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
overview of the
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
current state of the situation regarding
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
this question which has been a question
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
as representative bergeron pointed out
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
for longer than i've been around
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh and i've always been one that's come
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
down on the side of you know that you
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
have to pick your poison
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know you either want to
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
run for state rep
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
or you want to do moderator um i concede
 
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.029 align:start position:0%
or you want to do moderator um i concede
that

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
that representative bergeron and others
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
have raised
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
significant questions about about the
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
utility of that
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
in these circumstances um
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
but uh you know obviously if this were
 
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.070 align:start position:0%
but uh you know obviously if this were
not

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
a live issue it wouldn't be here and
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
but the only thing i could say about it
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
is i have no
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh answers any more than anyone else has
 
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh answers any more than anyone else has
however

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know at some point you have to at
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
some point you have to fish or cut bait
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
as my grandfather used to
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other committee
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
comments on part one
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
and chair we are on sb
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
83 representative growing yeah regarding
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative merhead's uh
 
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
uh representative merhead's uh
suggestion

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
could there be an amendment just to make
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
section one a a study instead of
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
i it can but i think my reply is
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
how many times do you study an issue it
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
sounds like this has been
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
studied maybe not by virtue of a formal
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
separate committee but it's certainly
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
been discussed a lot
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
um and i think representative cody makes
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
a valid point maybe some people just
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision i know in my
 
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision i know in my
community

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
the moderator has always just been the
 
00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:03.990 align:start position:0%
the moderator has always just been the
moderator

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
um and we've had about three moderators
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of time
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
um and maybe that has something to do
 
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
um and maybe that has something to do
with

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
how that election goes and that he's
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
handling ballots in my community once
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
you become moderator
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're there to you don't want to run
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
anymore or god has other plans for you
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
so and i know a lot of the communities
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
around me are like that
 
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
around me are like that
so

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know committee members can bring
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
what amendments they want forward but
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
um i just want everybody to understand
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
what the implications
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
are representative teroshian further
 
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
are representative teroshian further
comment

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair no i i concur
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
with what you were just saying
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
um i mentioned one of my towns uh having
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
the assistant moderator and the
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
moderator both state reps
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
in my town my current moderator was a
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
state rep
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
but he takes very seriously um his job
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
as moderator to be completely impartial
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
to the point where he was a registered
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
republican he he no longer associates
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
with a
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
party he goes out of his way to to to
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's no indication or
 
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's no indication or
[Music]

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
potential for there to be a conflict
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
interest and
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
so certainly you know people make that
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
choice maybe that's the
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
solution to with the future legislation
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with a way to maybe perhaps
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
have that kind of restriction
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
but it's getting back to part one it
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me the best thing we could do
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
with that is
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
to um is to i tell that portion of the
 
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:37.829 align:start position:0%
to um is to i tell that portion of the
bill

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
in its current form just my opinion at
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
all right i assume you're talking about
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
part one of representative friedas
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's been my ex that the experience of
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
the moderator is what keeps this
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
election running smoothly
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
and legally and i think it's rare i
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
i know somebody said there were two
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
representatives that are in my ward i
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
would prefer that
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
to be what it is that the moderator who
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
is running for another position
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
cannot touch in fact that happens i
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
cannot touch the ballots from the
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
counting then
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
so it's i i would leave it as it is
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
are you disclosing that you're a
 
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
are you disclosing that you're a
moderator

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
no i'm not a moderator i don't think i
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
want to be okay
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
no um and because we have one that is
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
so good it's so experienced why would i
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
want to lose that
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
because he's running for something
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
how many days does the moderator serve
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
in that role as compared to the
 
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:51.750 align:start position:0%
in that role as compared to the
representative

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
i just need a good mic and i have one
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
all right well so anything we pass will
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
be except for the good moderator and
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative friedas
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
district all right
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
all right part two of sb 83 is in
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
regards to the establishment of an
 
00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.269 align:start position:0%
regards to the establishment of an
election

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
information portal um
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
there were a fair amount of discussion
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
on this there was some
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not there
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
should have been a fiscal note
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
associated with it um and
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh the the end the
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
the end goal bill was that a
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
information portal would be
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
in place by january 1st of next year
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative tarouzian thanks again
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
um yes and this was the one i i was
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
speaking to before when we were on
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the other bills um because i
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
thought we had gone further ahead
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and so in and you heard uh deputy
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh scanlon say that um that
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
there was some concern on the on the uh
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the date
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor in this did
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
indicate that he
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem if we chose to
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
push the date dates out
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
and i think almost certainly if we had
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
an interest in passing that we would
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
have to do that
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
but i believe i might have been one that
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
asked the question about the fiscal note
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
on that or the
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
what the cost would be and that was a
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
concern as well so
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
those are the two issues i see with with
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
that i don't disagree in concept with
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
the idea but whether or not
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
as it's drafted we can get there on this
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair representative terezian
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
did you want to add something no i was
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
trying to i
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i tried to lower my hand i might have
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
hit it twice
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
no i'm all set all right representative
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
growing did you have something
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
yeah could uh deputy scanlon
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
comment on what an appropriate date
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan thank you madam chair um
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
too optimistic to think that we might
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
have a portal
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh like this in place for the 22
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
election cycle but
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
is something that i think is certainly
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
doable for
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
2024 so you know if that's the time
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
frame that the committee would
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
want to look at i think that's certainly
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
something that we could
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
make happen
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
deputy scaling i guess i have a question
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
there was some question about whether
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
who who would actually be doing this at
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
least in my mind i have some notes to
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
um this directs that
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
your office with the department of
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
was there some financial
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
implications of this i would presume and
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
was there some
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
other department that maybe should have
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
or would be involved in this
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
as i call all right
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
deputy scandal technology the language
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill um suggests that we work
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
with the department of information
 
00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:52.310 align:start position:0%
with the department of information
technology

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
when we're designing the portal um and
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
you know that's something we certainly
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
be happy to do
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
typically when there's ft project i'll
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
call it you know we we
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
establish the parameters um of what's
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be requested
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh put it in the form of an rfp and then
 
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
uh put it in the form of an rfp and then
have

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
some vendors uh you know submit their
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
proposals on
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
making the implementation of it happen
 
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
making the implementation of it happen
and

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
to do that obviously we have to rely on
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
some expertise
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
of i.t professionals which
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
um and that leads then to the question
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note you know once we
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
do that uh you know we get bids in yeah
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
we have a better handle of how much
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
this is actually going to cost based on
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody know whether the current
 
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.230 align:start position:0%
does anybody know whether the current
general

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
house website has what we would consider
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
a true portal on it
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
because from what i know these are
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much static
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
pages that provide links to documents
 
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.830 align:start position:0%
pages that provide links to documents
or

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
i think that that's anybody i don't
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
believe we do have anything
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um like a portal on the house
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
on the general court website
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think we do either and i
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
raise that just because i know
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
um for other reasons i'm looking at
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
websites and i know what our
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
staffing is in our current technology
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
as compared to what other places might
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
have in regards to portals
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
and information and staff because i'll
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
tell you right now
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have it um so
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
i have a major concern with this and
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
then when
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
we put in a date of the end of next
 
00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:06.390 align:start position:0%
we put in a date of the end of next
session

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know not that i think this section
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be undone but i'm not sure
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
that that's a practice i want to get
 
00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
that that's a practice i want to get
into

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
because in two years from now and i
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
don't think this is an issue that it
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
the next session could come in and say
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
be gone
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
and now you've directed people
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
on a path that maybe internally if they
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
had just done
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
would still be in place but by statute
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
we could potentially
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
all right well it sounds like
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's not general opposition to it but
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
there is some general at the
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
implementation and the date
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay section 3
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
of sb 83
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
where part 3 has to do with recount fees
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward it was presented
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative lane yeah sorry i can't
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
figure out how to raise my hand
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
um my comment was
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's just it's gonna cost
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh a senator more to
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
do a recount they're going to make
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
during their term
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it's going to count and it's going
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
to cost state rep almost the same amount
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
it i don't know it just kind of hit me
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
wrong but
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the price of
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
it just seems i don't know
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
odd are you are you talking about
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
section three with the
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
state senator and state representative
 
00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.669 align:start position:0%
state senator and state representative
yes

00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
but and i was just it just seemed
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
incongruent i mean
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's i mean we're basically public
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
servants we're making 100 bucks a year
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative barry i mean i i actually
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
have the the opposite feeling um
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i wished i wish they were higher
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of the i've participated
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
in a lot of recounts in the state
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
probably over 15 at this point including
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
municipal recounts
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
which are covered by this but um right
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
usually usually i probably in my
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
personal experience probably 70 percent
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the recounts i've participated in are
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
grossly unnecessary
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
um rarely ever with wyndham excluded
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
the current situation wyndham excluded
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
um do the results
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
change um and a lot of times these are
 
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.310 align:start position:0%
change um and a lot of times these are
um

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
these are feel good exercises for the
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
losing candidate and by the way i've
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
worked for both the winning and the
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
losing candidates so
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
i understand what it's like to be on
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
both sides of that um
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i hear you about the state reps and
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
the state senators um
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know i i i look at the i look more
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the concern
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
with the statewide and congressional
 
00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
with the statewide and congressional
districts

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and the cost associated with those
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office does an
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
excellent job on these recounts they
 
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:29.270 align:start position:0%
excellent job on these recounts they
spend

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and staff on these
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
recounts um and one of these days
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
um we will have a statewide recount and
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what the cost will be but
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
it will be high
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
um you know in 2016 the u.s senate race
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
was decided by a little more than a
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
thousand votes
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
um and that would have been a perfectly
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable recount to ask for
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
um given the margin right um so i guess
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i raise all that to say
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of on the other side of that
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
but i have no intention of changing it
 
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
but i have no intention of changing it
but

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
if somebody does change it to be higher
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative representative rosen
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks again i'm madam chair
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
i was going to comment um um and
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative barry kind of hit on it
 
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
representative barry kind of hit on it
that

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
i mean if you look at the old uh fee
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
schedule if you want to call
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
that um what a rep
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
paid was less for a recount than um
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
a state senate race so it's always been
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
um you know and i and i
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
to add to what um representative berry
 
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
to add to what um representative berry
said

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
his concern is a statewide and
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
congressional so
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a solution to that of
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
people concerned about you leave the fee
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
the same for
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the house and state senate maybe
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
even executive council and
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
and then the rest you do the increase i
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
i don't really have heartburn either way
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
other than i'm typically people that
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
know me know i i'm up
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
more often than not i vote against
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
things that are that are fee increases
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
because that's the way i am but um you
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
know i don't know what the cost of
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
what it costs to do a recount i know
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of volunteers if
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
we if we're woefully behind the cost
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
then we should increase it
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
again this was another section of the
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill that there was no fiscal note
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're already doing it so i'm assuming
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
the response would have been
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
no discernible change representative
 
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.060 align:start position:0%
no discernible change representative
growing

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.070 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
growing
[Music]

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i agree with
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry on this
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh i think the even with the raised
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
fees i'm sure that even with the
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
increased fees it comes nowhere near the
 
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.470 align:start position:0%
increased fees it comes nowhere near the
cost

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the recount uh the point here
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
it seems is to the the greater the
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
margin the higher the cost
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
to discourage people from from doing a
 
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.470 align:start position:0%
to discourage people from from doing a
um

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know asking for a recount if if
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's a larger margin
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i think the numbers are very
 
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.789 align:start position:0%
and i think the numbers are very
reasonable

00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
it you know what with the state rep
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
candidate i agree that it's a
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
low paid position but i can't imagine
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
very many state reps spending less than
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 times these amounts on their
 
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 times these amounts on their
campaigns

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think the amount if they really
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
want to recount would
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing it but it would
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh help to discourage spurious recounts
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry i mean i just want
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
to add
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
one more point about the state rep um
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
recount um not all state rep recounts
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
are created equal
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
um some districts are heads up you know
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about less than a thousand
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
voters maybe 1200 voters
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
um in my district i have one of the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
largest filterial seats
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of population in the state i've
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
got about i think 18 000 registered
 
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
got about i think 18 000 registered
voters

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
um so those recounts are different a
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
recount in dairy
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
where there's i believe there's almost
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's over eight reps in dairy now
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
um those multi-candidate recounts get
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
really really labor-intensive because
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
you're having to count you're not just
 
00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:05.269 align:start position:0%
you're having to count you're not just
recounting

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
recounting
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
the the the first win the last winner
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
and the first loser right you're
 
00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
and the first loser right you're
recounting

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
recounting
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
everything in there um so if those those
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
state rep recounts can be a little
 
00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:21.029 align:start position:0%
state rep recounts can be a little
sneaky

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay somebody wants to make amendments
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like in general there's not
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
if they're not overwhelming opposition
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
and there might be some
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
appetite for changing some of the fees
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
so make your amendments appropriately if
 
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.270 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.029 align:start position:0%
you're going to
[Music]

00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
part 4 of sb 83 is relative to the
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
itemized statements
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
filed by political committees and
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
candidate on
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
what was used to submit to the secretary
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
and ross berry was close to my heart on
 
00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:06.870 align:start position:0%
and ross berry was close to my heart on
this

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
in regards to saying that even font size
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
8 was not big enough
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
it should be 12. so
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative barry um to that uh
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
um madam chairman um i i did send an
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
amendment over to you from ols
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
i do have the uh fabled uh eight point
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
font a 12 point font amendment from ols
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
um it's my intention with that amendment
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
that if we edit this
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh omnibus bill that i'll present it if
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
for some reason edit this ominous bill
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
which i think is an unlikely situation
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'll just sit on it
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to have to needlessly
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
send this bill back to the senate if
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative terozian
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm one that and i'm not alone
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
i'm more of a grassroots guy and i don't
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
have a team
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
when i run for state rep and i suspect
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of others and i do
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
file my um reports
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know oftentimes i even fax them
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
and they're handwritten but you can read
 
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:15.990 align:start position:0%
and they're handwritten but you can read
them

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
and i don't want you know it's
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
problematic to me
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's just one more thing i have to do um
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
and others like me
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
now i have to you know spend more time
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
filing these things
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
if i have to have them all formatted on
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
on the computer and
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll go on record as being the
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
dumbest guy when it comes to computers
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the room and so that
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know the rest of it i'm fine with it
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
should they should be
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
legible but i don't want to be forced to
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
have to to
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
to do more work on these things because
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
what i do
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
submit is legible and it and then
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
they're handwritten and i do it myself
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's all so let other members of the
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
committee correct me i understand this
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
is a may that if you're doing it
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
electronically you have to do it in a
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
manner that's legible that that was the
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
intent it wasn't to force you to file it
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
electronically if you didn't want to
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
so somebody deputy scanlon you're on the
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
line could you uh
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
chime in as to whether that's your
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill or not
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am chair my understanding is
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
just to make the forums
 
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.789 align:start position:0%
just to make the forums
legible

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
legible
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
but if people are doing hand written
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
they can continue to do that that's my
 
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.269 align:start position:0%
they can continue to do that that's my
understanding

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that thank you if
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
they are handwritten that they are also
 
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.870 align:start position:0%
they are handwritten that they are also
legible

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
legible
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the for the
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
clarification because i thought i heard
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
in testimony that this would force
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
everybody to have to do them
 
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.470 align:start position:0%
everybody to have to do them
electronically

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'm on a misnomer there yeah
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
that was not my understanding
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
yes hi senator yes uh
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative terozin i just wanted to
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
point out that it's explicit
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
on line 22
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
page four for part four that
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
a candidate the political committee of a
 
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.230 align:start position:0%
a candidate the political committee of a
candidate

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
or a candidate may file such candidates
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
required reports
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
as an email attachment a facsimile or
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that makes it very clear that
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
you can continue
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
to file on paper okay
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
so the new section the new section
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
on line twenty eight just base
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madame for comments on part
 
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
thank you madame for comments on part
four

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any um so that sounds
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
like that i'm
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative sorry go ahead
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
sorry i need to look for your wave i
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
i i did it physically not virtually
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
um to representative quailey's point the
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
way i read that though is even with the
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
paper copy it says
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
provided that the font size
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
still would be required correct
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
but most people are going to write this
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
point but
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i think roman numeral 1 would still
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
apply but roman numeral 2 and 3
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't is that a correct
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
reading is that how you would read that
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding i didn't
 
00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:45.269 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding i didn't
particularly

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the facsimile your
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
paper copy i think you can print out on
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
the form and that would technically be
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
electronic but
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
um i understood that i think i recall in
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know some of the filings they would
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
make the font size purposely
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
small so that you couldn't read it as
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
printed and then you would have to
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
go to another you know medium so
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
i understood that you could still do
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
them hand written and this
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
really um dealt with if you look at the
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
title of
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
six here i am with my glasses and font
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
size 664 9a
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
this it specifically deals with the
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
and then the so i i sort of
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
saw it differently representative barry
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line 23 um it says
 
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.230 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line 23 um it says
printed

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
printed
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
so would there be a this is a good
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
question for all of our lawyers present
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
our attorneys um is there a difference
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
between written print printed
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm asking generally i i don't know
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is a this is
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
this one's uh this one's well well
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know they're probably i just
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
if somebody can hand write in eight
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
point font
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's you know at that point they
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
should be able to send it in
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well i would assume that written
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
graphologically and printed refers to
 
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.149 align:start position:0%
graphologically and printed refers to
printed

00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
printed
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
that would be my um that would be my
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
belief but um
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know i've been wrong before it it
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
also says
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
on line 31 that
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
the candidate shall be responsible for
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
ensuring the report
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
is legible and it gives the secretary of
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
state or attorney general's office uh
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
to me the uh discretion to inform the
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
yeah right this gives them a little t
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i think reasonable people know when
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
now we're talking politics and craziness
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative sandler
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am i'm going to take off my
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
former lawyer hat here and just use a
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
obsessive wordsmith interpretation
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
but legible means legible someone's
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
handwriting might be more legible than
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone else's printing
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
and more legible than certain small
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
fonts that we get off of our
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
computers or a typewriter or what have
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
you the operative term
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
is legible if it isn't legible
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
everything else falls by the wayside
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
all right we're putting that in the
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
record representative sandler we're not
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
taking many notes today but
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's going in
 
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:57.430 align:start position:0%
that's going in
[Music]

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else on part four
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing anything so
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to part five this is the
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
last section
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
there is yeah
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
part four in regards to optional town
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
meeting procedures
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
um this dealt with the
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative sandler you're back on on
 
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.829 align:start position:0%
representative sandler you're back on on
deck

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
deck
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
um the prior years versus the prior
 
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.349 align:start position:0%
um the prior years versus the prior
years

00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i see that uh cordell johnstone from
 
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
and i see that uh cordell johnstone from
nhma

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
nhma
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
is also with us who had commented on
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
this before
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna defer to committee members
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether that needs anything
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
or not anybody think
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that needs to change representative
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
i need you to unmute representatives
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
great thank you now you're on
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh was the question whether
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
are we still on the legibility of this
 
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
are we still on the legibility of this
uh

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
no no no we're on that now we're on the
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the issue of
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
a community being able to expend funds
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
before that fiscal year's budget
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
is approved and it's supposed to be at a
 
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
is approved and it's supposed to be at a
level

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
that is considered to be reasonable in
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
light of prior years budgets
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the issue came up in the word
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
i raised it i was the pain and i think i
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
was corrected as to the intent by
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
cordell johnstone
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
in regards to years on line five
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
year apostrophe yes as compared to
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
years with the plural apostrophe okay
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
years would be the plural you're right
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
if it's being compared to
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
a series of two or four or eight or
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
however many previous years
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
you would probably want to go back to
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
those years and determine what
 
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
those years and determine what
percentage

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the uh votes were affected by it
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
if it says apostrophe s that that
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
means we're talking about a particular
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
year and its
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
ownership of the question that's going
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
on there
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
so we could talk about last year's
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
budget thank you or prior years plural
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
where we would have to probably go back
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
and do some kind of a statistical
 
00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:41.270 align:start position:0%
and do some kind of a statistical
analysis

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
right and my concern is because this
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
issue is generally raised by people who
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
are very suspicious of what their
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
municipal leaders are doing in
 
00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:51.510 align:start position:0%
municipal leaders are doing in
expenditures

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
and my concern is and cordell i hope
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
when you said prior years
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
to me that left it wide open to any
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so if you had big spending five
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
years ago but the prior year had been
 
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.230 align:start position:0%
years ago but the prior year had been
pretty

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
lean you could argue that
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
a higher expenditure level until the
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
budget was approved was consistent with
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
a prior year budget five years ago
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i had thought that if you were going
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
if you're going to make a change it
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
should have been the prior
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year's appropriations
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
not prior years so let me open that up
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
to comment representative growing
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
i i felt the same way madam chair
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
um and i think if we took out
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
the years where it's located and we read
 
00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:47.670 align:start position:0%
the years where it's located and we read
this

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
in light of prior appropriations and
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures for the same purposes
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
during the same period
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the immediately prior fiscal period
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
and that would if the fiscal period is
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
more than one year
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
it would take care of that but it would
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
clearly relate to the immediately prior
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal period
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
um i see that um mr johnstone from the
 
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:18.950 align:start position:0%
um i see that um mr johnstone from the
new

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
municipal association is with us i've
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
asked him if he if he can unmute um
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
if you want to comment please yeah
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
um hi and and thank you for um
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
inviting me uh i my point is simply
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
that the language ought to be clarified
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh because on line five it says the
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
current law says
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
in light of prior year apostrophe s
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
and you need i think it needs to be
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
clear that we're
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
either we're referring to just the last
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
year singular or we're referring to
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
a series of prior years plural
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the way it's written right now it's
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's unclear because it
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
it says prior year apostrophe s
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to refer to just one year
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
you should say
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
the prior year apostrophe
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
s if you want to refer to several you
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
prior years s apostrophe
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
so so if you don't like changing year
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
apostrophe s to years
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
s apostrophe and i think what you want
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
to do is insert
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
the word the before prior
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
in light of the prior year
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
apostrophe s so it's clear that you're
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
just referring to last year
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
would it recorded i could speak up and
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
ask this question
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
school you know in my town my fiscal
 
00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:56.550 align:start position:0%
school you know in my town my fiscal
year

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
corresponds to a calendar year so
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
there's no question about what you would
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
be referring to for a year
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
our school district encompasses two
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
calendar years but it's one fiscal
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
year sense to have the word
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal associated with year as suggested
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
by representative growing i i think it's
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
fine to include the word
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
the word fiscal and in fact the language
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
that he suggested
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
um i don't remember it exactly but it
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
sounded it sounded fine to me
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
my point is just simply simply clarify
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
whether you're referring to
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
one year one fiscal year or or several
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal years
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
and and i don't think i have a strong
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
opinion as to which it should be
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
it just ought to be clear one way or the
 
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
it just ought to be clear one way or the
other

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to say in light of the
 
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.510 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to say in light of the
prior

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
that would i think that would be fine
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
that would clarify it
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative taurosian
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
thank you i had a question for mr
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
johnson i may
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
one of the questions was what was the
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
intent just the prior year or
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
or to be several prior years or years
 
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.109 align:start position:0%
or to be several prior years or years
that's

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
that was number one number two uh the
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year there's
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
some towns or
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
cities that start their fiscal year
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
prior to january 1st
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
most of the towns are on a calendar
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
but there are a handful that have a june
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
rather july 1
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
to june 30 fiscal year okay so it's a
 
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
to june 30 fiscal year okay so it's a
follow-up

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
the id this is to address those towns
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
that started there
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
they say the 2021 budget prior to
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
january of 2021 then
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
this is the reason well the the main
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
this is the reason well the the main
reason

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
if you forget about the change on line
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
five the main reason for the change
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
on lines three and four is to
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
is to extend the benefit
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
that is currently available only to
 
00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:14.230 align:start position:0%
that is currently available only to
towns

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
with a calendar fiscal year
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
to extend that to those that have
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
a june 30 fiscal year as well
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
because what happened last year
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh and it was very unusual obviously but
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic there were some
 
00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic there were some
towns

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
with a june 30 fiscal year that had to
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
postpone their town meeting
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
until july or august so they were
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
adopting their budget
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
after the fiscal year begins which they
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't ordinarily do
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
towns that are on a calendar fiscal year
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
always adopt their budget
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
after the after the fiscal year begins
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal year begins january 1 but
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
so thank you and the couple so yeah and
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
the couple of towns that i can think of
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
that have a meeting later than march
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
have their fiscal year beginning
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
july 1. so up until last year this was
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
not an
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
issue so this would clarify it
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions or
 
00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions or
comments

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair procedurally
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
sure um so
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
what would happen in a town and i
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
forgive me i have never
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
lived in a town i've lived in a city
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
what would happen in a town where you
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
did want to make a significant increase
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
in a portion of the budget how would you
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
go about doing that
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
you need to do it as part of your budget
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
so if on and on cordell i'm jumping in
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
here correct me if i'm on
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
as a former selectman i might have
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
decide that i want to spend
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
10 times more than i did last year on my
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
road plan
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay everybody wants a new road and i
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
decide i ran on new roads i'm going to
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
give everybody a new road
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
my budget would have a huge
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
increase in my public works budget
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
for that plan what this
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
would mean is if the prior year i wasn't
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
spending at 10 times the rate right i'm
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
proposing the increase
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
i can only spend at the rate of the
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
prior year until the voters go
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
and approve the increase and then
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
whenever my meeting is then i can go out
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
and order my asphalt and spend at that
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
rate and if they don't approve it
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
i've kept myself at the prior year's
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
level so i'm not running into a
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
budget disaster by doing a huge
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure and then having the voters
 
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:47.670 align:start position:0%
expenditure and then having the voters
say

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
hey we're not going to give you that
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
increase thank you cordell did i get
 
00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.349 align:start position:0%
increase thank you cordell did i get
that

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's right if you want uh
 
00:45:56.319 --> 00:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's right if you want uh
basically

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh you need to you need to be careful
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
about your expenditures
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
between january 1 and the town meeting
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh and as the law says be consistent
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
with the prior year's expenditures
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
if you want to increase something
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
tenfold you
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
very well better wait until town meeting
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
when the voters approve the budget
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then you can spend whatever they
 
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.589 align:start position:0%
and then you can spend whatever they
approve

00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i also think
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to put the
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
the word immediate in there if you're
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
really referring to the immediate past
 
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.230 align:start position:0%
really referring to the immediate past
year

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
somebody else brought that up i think
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
is that right with here or years so
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm hoping that representative
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
growing has volunteered to do an
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
amendment along the lines of the words
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
that he suggested i think it was he
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative okay
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative quailey thank you madam
 
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.670 align:start position:0%
representative quailey thank you madam
chairman

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh i agree that clarification is really
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
needed and i think the
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
the the introduction of the word fiscal
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
is really important here
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
and and it is needed for the towns that
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
have their fiscal year
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
begin july 1st and i thought
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative groan's
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendment did a good job of clarifying
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
and it's important to clarify it because
 
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.589 align:start position:0%
and it's important to clarify it because
it

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
it needs to be clear otherwise i'm also
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
a former select when i did one term here
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
in rindge
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
and things need to be very clear or the
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
possibility for conflict and dissension
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
rises very quickly so this needs this
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
fix needs to be done
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you all right anybody else
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing anything so we're
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
going to move on
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislation relating to
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%

of the registrar of probate
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron when we get to
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%

of the computer that i'm on i'm not
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to be able to dual screen very
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
easily so
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to need you to take the lead
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
on that amendment so part
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
one relative to the city chief
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
election officer this appeared to be
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
a change in label
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
um the term being used as a descriptor
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.549 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move on to part two
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
regarding taking up photographs within
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think we sort of discussed what the
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
purpose and
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
function of this one this is separate
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
from taking a picture of your own ballot
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any part three in regards
 
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any part three in regards
to

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
the pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
comments questions that's this is like
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
the calm before the storm
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay sure representative bergeron why
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't you go ahead with your amendment
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair um
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the intent as i understand it from the
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor in part
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
was to allow for cities and towns to be
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
able to reach out
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
to voters who were voting absentee whose
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
paperwork or affidavits weren't filled
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
out properly
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
and give them an opportunity to correct
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
those errors prior to the ballots being
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
counted on election day
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's a concept i think i would
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
hope that all of us support to try and
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
make it work
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
it was the approach to it the logistics
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
of it that i
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about um
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some conflicting
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh original senate bill 89 as amended
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
for example in one section it was saying
 
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.309 align:start position:0%
for example in one section it was saying
that

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
if someone was voting in person the
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
clerk could
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh take a look at the affidavit make
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
sure it was
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
um filled out properly but at the same
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
time was saying in that section that the
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
clerk had to have a policy
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
providing a 24-hour notice that this be
 
00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:22.549 align:start position:0%
providing a 24-hour notice that this be
done

00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
it also provided that uh at five o'clock
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
the day after the the day before an
 
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:30.950 align:start position:0%
the day after the the day before an
election

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
that the moderator would be processing
 
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.870 align:start position:0%
that the moderator would be processing
these

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot applications um
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
and you know presumably to find errors
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that occurred in the affidavits
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and then the clerk would have to contact
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
these people to
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
try and correct the paperwork of course
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is the night
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
before an election the election
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
officials are probably trying to set up
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
their polling places
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in practice once the
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
office is closed on that monday night
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
um there's no one going to be even if
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk can reach out to these people
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be anyone there to
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
accept the correction um and if that
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're telling them to go to the polls on
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
election day
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to vote in person the next day
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
um you know again you have the problem
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
well they're voting absentee because
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
they can't go to the polls
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that i was proposing
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
kind of took a look at uh
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
what we did during the covet uh
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
experiences last fall which would allow
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
the moderator to do the pre-processing
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
on certain days after the checklist has
 
00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:38.549 align:start position:0%
on certain days after the checklist has
been

00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
certified by the supervisors of the
 
00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:41.589 align:start position:0%
certified by the supervisors of the
checklist

00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
it eliminated the the night before which
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
is monday because
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
now the purpose is to try and find out
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
where there have been errors
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
that have occurred um it still directs
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
the town of city clerk
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
to try and reach out to these people to
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
see if we can get
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
their paperwork uh corrected
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh it also adds the word affidavit
 
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
uh it also adds the word affidavit
envelope

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
and application because sometimes it's
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
not just the
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
envelope that's a problem it might be
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
the application itself
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
so we're asking the the moderator to
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
look at both of those
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's focusing on the moderator doing
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
this because under state laws the
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
moderator who ultimately has to make the
 
00:53:23.119 --> 00:53:24.150 align:start position:0%
moderator who ultimately has to make the
decision

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not a voter's paperwork
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
has been properly executed and the vote
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
should be counted
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh so even if the clerk was doing a lot
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
of preliminary work ultimately the
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
moderator has to go through all of those
 
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.670 align:start position:0%
moderator has to go through all of those
envelopes

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the paperwork has
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
been properly executed
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
the uh other provision i
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
i put in there is and and representative
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
hamlin as well
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
is to say that if the moderator want to
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
hold sessions prior to the
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
certification the checklist they could
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
do so they just couldn't mark up the
 
00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.270 align:start position:0%
do so they just couldn't mark up the
checklist

00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
until that session that occurs after
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is mandatory
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
that occurs after the uh checklist has
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
been posted
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think i've covered about the key
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
things i i mean i tried to
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
preserve the intent of senator gray's
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
proposal and try and
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
resolve some of the logistical problems
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
i saw with it
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
using as a model what was done with
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1266
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
i'd like to think that that we were able
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
and i guess if if you know other
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee members have any questions or
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
or input on this approach i would
 
00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:37.589 align:start position:0%
or input on this approach i would
certainly

00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee members um is representative
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
mooney in
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
in lobby because i know she had a
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
conversation with her
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
clerk um and i i
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
wondered if she was available to share
 
00:54:56.079 --> 00:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
wondered if she was available to share
it

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
i'll probably okay we can okay
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes i was contacted by my town's
 
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
yes i was contacted by my town's
moderator

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
she did have three very specific
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to the bill and i
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
frankly representative erdogan's
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment covers a couple of them
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to really get them verbatim so
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
could you just give me one moment
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
to look for them
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
sure in the meantime representative
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
tarosian did you have a comment on this
 
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.789 align:start position:0%
tarosian did you have a comment on this
section

00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
yes um we heard in testimony on um
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
on page two i guess of this uh section
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
um line 17 that the town and city clerks
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
are the
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
designee shall open outer envelopes of
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
all assets ballots received prior to 5
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
pm on the day
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
prior to election day we heard testimony
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
from from
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
some town clerks one in particular was
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the town clerk from derry
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
who had a concern with that
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
um being required that it shall and that
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
the word may
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
may be better in that regard um and so i
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
didn't know if the
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
if representative bergeron's amendment
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
would address that section
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
or not uh if i may respond madam chair
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
sure representative bertrand um i had
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
that question of senator
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
gray during his testimony i said was it
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
your intent to make this mandatory
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
for all elections and he said yes um
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
so i kept in the language shell
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
and uh what i did in my amendment is
 
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.270 align:start position:0%
and uh what i did in my amendment is
that

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
say after the checklist has been posted
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
or certified by the supervisors of the
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
checklist the moderators
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
shall hold a session to uh review these
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know open the elder envelopes and
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
review the affidavits
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
and uh i mean his as i understood it his
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
intent was to ensure
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
that election officials would try and uh
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
make corrections to any of the paperwork
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
that voters may have inadvertently made
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
errors to
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
to allow their votes to be cast on
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
election day so
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mooney do you
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
have your notes
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the first one
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
is to allow
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that's in line with what
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative terozian just brought up
 
00:57:42.799 --> 00:57:43.829 align:start position:0%
representative terozian just brought up
okay

00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
number two is to allow
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
processing during the thursday through
 
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.230 align:start position:0%
processing during the thursday through
saturday

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
prior to election not monday
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
and i see that very clearly in the
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
bergeron gambling amendment
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
age 1 16 through
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
19 and then
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
issue three allow challengers during
 
00:58:11.359 --> 00:58:11.829 align:start position:0%
issue three allow challengers during
free

00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair yet my amendment did not
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
address the issue of
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
of challenging um challenges occur
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually at the polls as the voter's
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
name is being announced
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
um and that would continue to be the
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
practice even with
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
those absentee ballots that were
 
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.990 align:start position:0%
those absentee ballots that were
pre-processed

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
pre-processed
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
based on again what i think senator
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
gray's intent was
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
i tried to preserve that intent in the
 
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.829 align:start position:0%
i tried to preserve that intent in the
amendment

00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron and i apologize
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
for not being able to
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
see your amendment um there was a
 
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:56.870 align:start position:0%
see your amendment um there was a
comment

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
during during our public hearing on
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh the second page of the bill of the
 
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.109 align:start position:0%
uh the second page of the bill of the
part

00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
page three i think line 21 about the
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
moderator shall
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
then mark the chess list and there was
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion that that
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
be changed to the moderator or the
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
moderator's designee
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
does anybody recall that or think it's
 
00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:19.990 align:start position:0%
does anybody recall that or think it's
material

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
if this section of the bill is going to
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
i i think i did say throughout my
 
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.030 align:start position:0%
i i think i did say throughout my
amendment

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
the moderator or the moderators designee
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay great really does in the
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and i if i may add during the public
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the members of the
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee asked
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
how many people are we really talking
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
about in trying to reach out
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
who may not have filled out the
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
affidavits or the paperwork properly
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
um my my best guess based on experience
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
that is less than half of one percent
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
the uh of the absentee ballots received
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
the the real workload is the opening and
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
the reviewing of all the absentee
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
ballots not necessarily
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative groan
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i have a
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
question for representative bergeron
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
she's willing to take it
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead uh
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
do i understand that your amendment
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
would establish
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
certain days and possibly times for the
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the pre-processing
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sort of an open notice
 
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.030 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sort of an open notice
process

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes the uh the pre-processing the
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
mandatory session
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
should not occur until the supervisors
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the checklist have
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
have certified uh the checklist for use
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
at the election and that usually
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
will occur seven to ten days before the
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
i looked at the dates actually the day
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
selected for house bill 1266
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
which was the um the covid
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with pre-processing of
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
it specifically said thursday friday
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
saturday or monday
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
so in modeling that language i included
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
the words thursday friday or saturday
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
prior to the time established for
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
the date of the election so yes there
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
are specific days
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
it it really doesn't matter i suppose as
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
long as it occurs after the checklist
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead representative
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
one of the uh concerns that i have
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the uh probably the main concern
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
with the pre-processing
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
is that when uh when a notice is given
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
um that that notice
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
unless somebody is necessarily really
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
watching for it they may not see it
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
election day is always the same tuesday
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
and people know that and i'm wondering
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we could specify
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
a certain like on say thursday and
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
friday at 10 o'clock
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
that 10 or 10 o'clock and following that
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
that this would be done so that we
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
establish a very
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
definitive time that is the same in all
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
that people then know okay this is this
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
is when the pre-processing is going to
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
be done and it becomes a habit
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to something that can be
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
announced and
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
changed by every town and in any
 
01:02:36.799 --> 01:02:40.549 align:start position:0%
changed by every town and in any
situation

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
if with permission let me chime in on
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
i do sort of like that but
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that the last september
 
01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:51.670 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that the last september
election

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
that a after labor day the tuesday after
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
labor day
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you recall the primary um
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
we were setting up actually the thursday
 
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:03.670 align:start position:0%
we were setting up actually the thursday
night

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
and friday before the election because
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's when we had
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
staff available and could do it
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
and of course school wasn't really in
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
session um
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
so that's my i will tell you that's sort
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
of my concern
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
one of the the things about doing these
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
is your clerk slash moderators ability
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
to find volunteers
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
to come in and do this process
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
and if we handicap i don't want to say
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
handicap if we limit it to a particular
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
day you may end up with communities that
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
just say
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
we might like to do it but we there's i
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
can't get enough volunteers that day
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
or my moderator's not available or
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
um but i agree that it needs it there
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
some parameters on when it occurs
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
if i may madam chair just to add yeah
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 1266 modeled some of what was
 
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.430 align:start position:0%
house bill 1266 modeled some of what was
in

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 556 which i sponsored last
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
session to allow for pre-processing of
 
01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:10.870 align:start position:0%
session to allow for pre-processing of
ballots

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
and during all the discussions and
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee public hearings
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
some of the issues you raised actually
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
were discussed that there should be
 
01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.510 align:start position:0%
were discussed that there should be
specific

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
days identified
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
thursday and friday became two of those
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
days that were identified
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
and then saturday was was added because
 
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.190 align:start position:0%
and then saturday was was added because
um

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
one of the senators felt well maybe this
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
should be done at the polling sites
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
and since so many polling sites are in
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
the schools it couldn't be done during
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh while school was in session and
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
therefore they threw in the saturday
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
so there was some consideration given to
 
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
try and identify
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
a very limited number of days when that
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
that could occur
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if there's really a
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
perfect solution for all communities as
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative griffin kind of alluded
 
01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
representative griffin kind of alluded
to

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair uh yes i just
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate that um
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
when the the clerk i mean it worked
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
really well in the
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the last election in the in the in
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
the covid
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
covert election um so when the clerk
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
announces that
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
the date of the pre-processing he or she
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
also has to announce the time
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
so the the clerk makes that very clear
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
that you know there's a date and time
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the where you know where the when the
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
pre-processing will occur in the
 
01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.069 align:start position:0%
pre-processing will occur in the
location

01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
where it will occur so i don't think
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
that needs to be a statewide
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
you know specific rule but the town
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
clerks do know that they have to make it
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
very clear that
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
the date time and place of where the
 
01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
the date time and place of where the
pre-processing

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
pre-processing
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
will occur thank you
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative grohan one other
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh question on this a concern and that
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
is that if we
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we uh introduce may versus shell
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
and some towns do go through the
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
pre-processing and allow
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
voters to uh correct their application
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
and other towns choose not to then are
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to run into a situation of
 
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
are we going to run into a situation of
of

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh that that voters and those in the in
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
the first group of towns
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
will have a an advantage over those in
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
the other towns and is the court going
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
i think that is a point raise and one of
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons that senator gray uh
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
used the word shell in his language
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um since since
 
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.069 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um since since
that

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
brought up about um there being an
 
01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
brought up about um there being an
inconsistency

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
this bill or this part of the bill has
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
has that built in
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
in that in essence it rewards
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
voters who vote early that have a chance
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
to have the information corrected
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
when those that don't on their absentee
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
ballots come in
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
after that date they don't have the
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of um
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
of having their missing signature an
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
incorrect name and so forth verified so
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
we already have that problem as as the
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
um yes to build on what representative
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
trojan said i think there's
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
a big equal protection issue here um
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically for those ballots that come
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
in late
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
um it's it you know we're the the kova
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
19 election 2020 is getting referenced
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
a lot um in which there was a surge of
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you can most certainly make the
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
argument that when a third of the
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
electorate was voting with absentee
 
01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:52.710 align:start position:0%
electorate was voting with absentee
ballots

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that that this was necessary but i i
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't think going into 2022 that we're
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
going to see
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of turn out again and that
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
reliance on absentee ballots i also have
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
serious trepidations
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
about moving election day away from
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh that has been a new hampshire
 
01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:12.150 align:start position:0%
uh that has been a new hampshire
tradition

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
tradition
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
going back over a hundred years that
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
election day happens on election day and
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to stop anybody from
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
voting with an absentee that's their
 
01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
voting with an absentee that's their
right

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
certain people are not available at the
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
polls on that day and they have to cast
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
but we need to treat everybody equally
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
we need to treat everybody the same
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe we need to make sure that
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
we're keeping with the
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire tradition of voting on
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
election day when possible
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
and that's why i want that's why i'm i'm
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
a big believer and as mitch
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
as much election activity needs to
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
happen on election day as is possible
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think in the future we are going to
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
have electronic poll books i think those
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
are going to be commonplace
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
in if we pass this this previous bill
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
probably in six years
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's going to dramatically reduce the
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
amount of staff or volunteers that are
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
needed on election day because the lines
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be much shorter there's no
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be a through d
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
anymore there's going to be four lines
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
you walk up you go to whatever
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
everyone's open and you vote
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're moving towards
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
addressing a lot of the problems that
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
pre-processing is attempting
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
to deal with already and
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
i i think we're kind of moving away from
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
that traditional new hampshire
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
experience of voting on election day
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
so representative bergeron has his
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
amendment he's um the committee members
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
if people have further changes or other
 
01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:44.070 align:start position:0%
if people have further changes or other
amendments

01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
um they want to do i would suggest
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
either working
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
off of representative bergeron's
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
amendment with his amendment
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay the next section
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
all right the next section of sb 89
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
is part 4 which has to do with the
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee to study post-election audit
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
um and some recount
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
discrepancy authorization investigation
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general's office
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
comments from committee members
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my comments
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
pertain specifically to the
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
first section of part four which is on
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
page three starting with line 27
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
post-election audit counting devices
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh last session senate bill 283
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
required that the secretary of state
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
conduct a study
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
of high-speed optical scan ballot
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
to assess the feasibility of using such
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
equipment in a post-election audit
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
um that report was due november 1st
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
but given the challenges posed
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
during the last fall election by covet
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the preparations the
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state had to make to
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
to address those issues at the polls uh
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't released until march
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
23rd senator gray's bill
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
was actually introduced on january
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
26th prior to the secretary of state's
 
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.669 align:start position:0%
26th prior to the secretary of state's
report

01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know in looking at this section i
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
think basically senator gray
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
is asking to establish a special
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
committee to do what the secretary of
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
state has already done
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not so sure there's this value in
 
01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
so i'm not so sure there's this value in
creating

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
that committee at this time we have
 
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
that committee at this time we have
retained

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative lang's bill in our
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
representative lang's bill in our
committee

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
to address the issues of post-election
 
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.350 align:start position:0%
to address the issues of post-election
audits

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
audits
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that perhaps that's really
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
all we need we don't need to establish
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
to uh do the work that was done last
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
session with senate bill 283 which by
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%

representative taurosian thank you madam
chair

chair
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
and uh question to represent bergeron
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
that senate bill he referenced that the
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
study has been completed was that
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
was that a similar type committee
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
um by that i mean did did it have um
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple members of the
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
senate uh three members from the house
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth or was it was it a standard
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh study commission as this proposes to
 
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.910 align:start position:0%
uh study commission as this proposes to
do

01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
no it wasn't a study committee it simply
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
directed the secretary of state to uh
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
conduct a study as to the feasibility of
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
using these devices
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
as post for post-election audits so the
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
secretary of state was charged with uh
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
finding vendors to do it to conduct the
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
studies to use
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh ballots from previous elections to
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
see what kinds of results they were
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to forward a copy of that
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
report the secretary of state's report
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
to all members of the committee
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
so that you could see what it entails
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's a 44-page report but 37 of the
 
01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:25.990 align:start position:0%
it's a 44-page report but 37 of the
pages

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
are the vendor's data which are attached
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
to deputy scanlan's
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
commentary i'd love to get a copy thank
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for emailing that to committee
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
members there was
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
a request for vendors to come and do a
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
trial run uh the secretary of state
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
conducted it up at the state archives
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
um there were two vendors i think that
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
become um another vendor was unable to
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
attend you might re it
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
occurred last fall whereas has been
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
referenced there were a lot of competing
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
interests going on for these
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
vendors that have these machines i had
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
there for part of it it was pretty
 
01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
there for part of it it was pretty
impressive

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
to watch um ballots which were um
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
put in huge stacks into
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
um high speed readers and how fast they
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
were processed
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
and that the machines could
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
pick up questions that were then
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
pulled out which allowed them whoever
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
the decision maker would have been
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
to sit at a machine and actually look
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
electronically at the ballot to make a
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
determination for example whether the
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
circle was
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
adequately filled in it was pretty
 
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.669 align:start position:0%
adequately filled in it was pretty
impressive

01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i just sort of threw that out
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that was as representative bergeron
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
said as a result of senator gray's bill
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments from
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
on this section
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh madam chairman uh uh
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i agree with uh senator uh with
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
on on that section one of
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
section three but it seems to me that
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
section two we're on section four
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me section one i mean part four
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so excuse me
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
on section one of part four uh
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
asking for a study committee uh i agree
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh on that part that i think we should
 
01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.270 align:start position:0%
uh on that part that i think we should
just

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh deal with whatever we want to do with
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
this on representative lang's bill
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
but then if you go to line 15 on page
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
four and then
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
line um 35 on page four it seems that
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
those are
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
very different topics that aren't part
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the study committee if i'm reading it
 
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.950 align:start position:0%
of the study committee if i'm reading it
correctly

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
um so those are
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
those really are it appears to me not
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i i also recall that on
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
on the lion 30 where it starts on line
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
35 that madam chair you had
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
some concern about the about
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh the wording of the authority given to
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission as being a bit
 
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.350 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission as being a bit
broad

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
broad
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
um yes i did thank you for pointing that
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
out let's go back as senator
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
i mean representative growing points out
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
that representative bergeron's
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
comments in regards to the committee
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with only section one
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
of part four so i'm gonna move on to
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
that section deals with recaps
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i don't show that there was
 
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.350 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i don't show that there was
much

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
question or comment on this section
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything on this
 
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.030 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything on this
changed

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan i believe you're still on
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the line if you could
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
speak as to the purpose and whether or
 
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
speak as to the purpose and whether or
not

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
section two of part four has any
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
concerns for the secretary of state's
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
office since they
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
are in charge of recounts
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
and section four is uh
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
is a reaction to uh what's happening
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
with uh wyndham right now and a
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
disparity between
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
the the count on election night and the
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
recount um
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
and you know the the
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
the the process uh took place as it's
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
doing the statute where there was
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
election night count
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
there was a recount that showed a large
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
disparity which
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
is which is unusual it's not unheard of
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
but it's unusual
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the bell law commission heard the
 
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.630 align:start position:0%
um the bell law commission heard the
appeal

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh and they ruled that you know that
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
change in the outcome of the election
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh after the recount and and they
 
01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh after the recount and and they
declared

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
declared
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh the winners uh you know that were
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
chosen on the night of recount so
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
the question then became well you know
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
when when
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
all of the republican candidates uh jump
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
up roughly 300 votes
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
and the one democrat candidate went down
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
99 what was the reason for that and
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon i don't deputy scanlon i
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't phrase my question well enough
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
for a moment
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
before we get to i think section three
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know whether the secretary
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
of state's office had any
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
comment or opinion on the exp expansion
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
in regards to the conduct of a recount
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
in section two
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
expanding the language the ballots cast
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
for such
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
office or question including votes cast
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the candidates or question on the
 
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.189 align:start position:0%
for the candidates or question on the
ballot

01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
right in votes and not counted from over
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
votes or under votes language
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
because i didn't really i don't have any
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
notes indicating
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
that there was really much said about
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
this and i'm not sure what the problem
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
is it's trying to address
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay so the the law currently says that
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
that are counted in a recount are the
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
ballots that were
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
cast in the election
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
um and it's as simple as that so when we
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
conduct a recount
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
we do not count the ballots
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
that were not used in the election
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and there are some that believe that
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
that uh we should account for the whole
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
universe of ballots that were sent to
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
the temple
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
for the election whether they were cast
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
i mean it's up to the legislature to
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
decide whether we should go through the
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
exercise of counting
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
ballots that were not used or not it
 
01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:45.430 align:start position:0%
ballots that were not used or not it
will

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
require more time to do that and uh
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
we try to be as efficient as possible
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
during the recount so that's what that
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
part of the bill does
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
but deputy scale and if i can continue
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
this with the committee's indulgence
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't talk about ballots this
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
votes so this means that this would
 
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
votes so this means that this would
direct

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
to count votes that were legally not
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
well i'm looking if you're looking at on
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
page 4 lines 19 and 20.
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
is that is that what we're talking about
 
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.430 align:start position:0%
is that is that what we're talking about
yes

01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes uh including votes cast for the
 
01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
yes uh including votes cast for the
candidates

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
or the question write-in votes
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we count those uh and not voted
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
resulting from over votes or undervotes
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
an additional requirement that we do not
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
do now
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
where if let's say in in
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
if there's a town where you elect four
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the voter only cast votes for three
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
then we would have to count that no vote
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
in a no vote category
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to that if it was
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
vote for four
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the voter voted for five
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
we would also have to account for
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
the fact for that fifth vote um
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so there again that would require
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
additional time it's not something that
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
right now if if they is under counted
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
we simply count the ballots that were
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
cast if the ballot was over voted
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
we simply count that ballot as no votes
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
being cast for any candidate
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah but it doesn't say ballot it
 
01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
um yeah but it doesn't say ballot it
says

01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
votes that's my concern my
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
concern here is this appears to be
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
directing counting those
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
votes not those ballots
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i understand that there's a concern
 
01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.669 align:start position:0%
so i understand that there's a concern
that

01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a check as to
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
whether the total amount of ballots that
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
a town receives an election
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
are the same as the amount of ballots
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
that might come back for recount
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
but to me that's very different than
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
votes and my concern is is that if we're
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
directing you
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
to count votes over voted
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
undervoted that were not part of the
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
tape totals plus
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
they can't recounts we are now having a
 
01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.070 align:start position:0%
they can't recounts we are now having a
recount

01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
recount
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the fifth column so to speak total
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
votes possibly for a candidate
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
that were not counted legally
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying madam
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
chair and and i think that
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
that this language does do that it's
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay that's all i need that's all i
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
needed to hear okay
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
all right i'm just i i will say flat out
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think that is a huge
 
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:12.530 align:start position:0%
mistake um
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
mistake um
[Music]

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i will either or ask somebody else
 
01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:17.350 align:start position:0%
and i will either or ask somebody else
to

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
to take this proposed language out
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
raising the possibility that we're going
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
to count
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
at an official recount votes that were
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
not part of the official election
 
01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:28.390 align:start position:0%
not part of the official election
results

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
creates a huge problem i don't have an
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
issue with ballots and maybe after the
 
01:24:33.679 --> 01:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
issue with ballots and maybe after the
audit

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
is done and we have an audit report
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
there will be a process to do that
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's clearly delineated
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
but i think allowing that possibility of
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
a result without
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
those guard rails so to speak
 
01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:50.910 align:start position:0%
is incredibly
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:52.550 align:start position:0%
is incredibly
[Music]

01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous as to confidence in election
 
01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.950 align:start position:0%
dangerous as to confidence in election
results

01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
all right so that was section two
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
section three deputy scanlan um
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
i think you had started to talk about
 
01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:10.830 align:start position:0%
i think you had started to talk about
and

01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
um is language
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
um that was somewhat referred to in
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
significant and unexplained discrepancy
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
as to what that
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
means and i have to tell you i i
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that i want a bill that has
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
anything related to the possibility of
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
could undermine public confidence
 
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
could undermine public confidence
because

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty broad too deputy
 
01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.910 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty broad too deputy
scanlan

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
scanlan
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i just follow
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
along the line that you were going
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
is that this is a reaction to what's
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
occurring in windham right now
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and i think that it would make sense
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
for that process to play out
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh before we start engaging in a
 
01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.110 align:start position:0%
uh before we start engaging in a
conversation

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
of you know what post uh
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
election and recount and bow law
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
commission appeals processes
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
should look at look like um the danger
 
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:04.790 align:start position:0%
should look at look like um the danger
here

01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
is that you know we get away from from
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
a quick finality to the election and get
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
into a process that could be
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
really drawn out and um
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know i think that again we should
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
look at how the windham
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
situation plays out before we start
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know post election and recount
 
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
you know post election and recount
procedures

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
other members with comments on section 3
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
of sb 89 part
 
01:26:42.159 --> 01:26:45.430 align:start position:0%
of sb 89 part
4

01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any and i don't see
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative lane's hand
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
so part four of part
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
four of sb or section 4 of part 4 of sb
 
01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.950 align:start position:0%
four of sb or section 4 of part 4 of sb
89

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
89
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
starts on page 5 of the bill i have is
 
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
starts on page 5 of the bill i have is
printed

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
printed
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
and it deals with the attorney general's
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
office with enforcement
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
my notes reflect that currently the
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
authority to seal or
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
unseal ballot boxes less rests with the
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
that this allows the attorney general to
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
unseal and resale seal the ballot boxes
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
um i this i guess maybe is for the
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state or other lawyers on
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
the committee the attorney general's
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
office is usually
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
part of the enforcement arm of
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
election laws not the participant
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what impact having
 
01:28:00.719 --> 01:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what impact having
them

01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
physically involved in
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
ballot sorting counting
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
retaining issues does to that process
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
anybody have a comment i don't recall
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about that
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
prior to today was that
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have any notes specifically
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
i i agree there i just i have i have
 
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.189 align:start position:0%
i i agree there i just i have i have
myself

01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
highlighted the attorney general may
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
unseal and reseal
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes because that was apparently
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
a flag of a concern of mine
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
no no i haven't remarked as well but
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
maybe they did i don't know i have a
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative groin i i do recall i
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure if uh senator gray
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
spoke about this at the hearing or if it
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
was a discussion i had with him
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
after the hearing but
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
the section four is an enabling
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
section for section three
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
as i understand it if you look at line
 
01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
as i understand it if you look at line
eight

01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
through ten it says that the the
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
authority uh at the end of line eight
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
whenever the ballot law commission
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
requests an investigation be conducted
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
may steal or unseal and the
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
argument was this time
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general said he did
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to unseal and
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
reseal the ballot boxes
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
so this was to give him the authority if
 
01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
so this was to give him the authority if
the

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh election law commission said hey we
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
want this looked into
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
it gave the attorney general and rsa
 
01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
it gave the attorney general and rsa
76-c

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
76-c
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
the right to do that i believe that's
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
the intent that it's
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's really it's really the enabling
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
part for
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
section three thank you representative
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
groan i would point out that i would
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
argue it does not actually limit it to
 
01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.229 align:start position:0%
argue it does not actually limit it to
that

01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
it actually gives the attorney general
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
upon his
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
or her own motion so it is not
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
just authorizing the ballot law
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
commission to direct the attorney
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
general's office to do something
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
which i don't know that that's a policy
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we want to adopt it allows the
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general to do it
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
on their own motion again i'm not sure
 
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:39.669 align:start position:0%
on their own motion again i'm not sure
that's

01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
a policy we want to adopt attorney
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh let me look here representative
 
01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh let me look here representative
tarosian

01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
tarosian
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just going to say madam chair
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
that um yeah it looks to
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
make um the process we went through with
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill 43
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
um if if this if this windham
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
problem were to crop up in the future um
 
01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
problem were to crop up in the future um
without

01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
this part of uh of senate bill 89
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
in place we'd have to go through if we
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
house so desired we'd have to go through
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
the same process again
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
to um to get those ballots unsealed this
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
in my opinion looks to attempt to
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
put in law the ability for the
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to address
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
this in the future were to
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
come up no i don't know whether you know
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
if limits are not limits i'm
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
that that appears to me to be the reason
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
why that's in there
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
what i can tell that was
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
senator gray's intent uh for my
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
discussion with him that's what it looks
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it's my understanding
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the issue is
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes because there's specific
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
statutes in regard to the retention of
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
ballots and how that is handled
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
and that the attorney general's office
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
now and in fact has um
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
done books records papers about
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
documentary materials so
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
i mean it's sort of a mishmash is what i
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
would sort of say
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i i understand the issue
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
that came up but
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure from a policy standpoint i
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
want the attorney general
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
whoever that might be to have the
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
ability to go get ballot boxes and
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
unseal them for whatever
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
they might think needs to be
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
investigated because as written does not
 
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:39.990 align:start position:0%
investigated because as written does not
require

01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission to do the
 
01:32:41.679 --> 01:32:44.629 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission to do the
direction

01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair would you be okay with this
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
if we eliminated
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
no probably not because i think to be
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
um you're taking the you're making a
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
major change
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
in the ballot law commission authority
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
um and i come back to what's a
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
significant and
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
i mean you know other people are not
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
raising a major
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
issue with this so i mean that's part of
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
having this
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
discussion so people can raise issues
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
that maybe they hadn't thought about or
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
maybe hanging out on the limb about to
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
fall off the branch all by themselves
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
well there's also the issue of the
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
discretion that
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
that language arguably grants to the
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay i think those are concerns
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
does the secretary of state's office um
 
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a position that they want to
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
set forth in regards to this provision
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh we have
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about this portion
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh as well for the you know
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
from the items that you mentioned um i i
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
will let the committee know that
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
that right now there is an opportunity
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
to unseal
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes if there are documents or
 
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.270 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes if there are documents or
equipment

01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh that were left in them after the
 
01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh that were left in them after the
election

01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh that are needed after the election
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
process involves the secretary of state
 
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.189 align:start position:0%
process involves the secretary of state
going

01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
to the town uh with witnesses in the
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
boxes to retrieve those items
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh and then seal them it's getting
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
specific to the attorney general
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
if there is a an investigation a
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
that they are undertaking related to a
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
ballots or an election they do have the
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to the court
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
and have the court grant an order that
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
would allow them to open those boxes for
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
that specific purpose
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
aside from that the boxes after election
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
and all appeals are over are sealed
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
and they are kept for the mandatory 22
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
months as required by federal law
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
after the election at which point they
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
are destroyed
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
town election ballots are kept for 60
 
01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:25.430 align:start position:0%
town election ballots are kept for 60
days

01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you comments or questions from
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
of this section of sb 89.
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna move on to
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
section five which is
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
a relative to the duties of the
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
registrars of probate
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
this actually probably did get the most
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
public participation of all of the parts
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
as i recall committee members
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you madam
 
01:36:16.159 --> 01:36:17.590 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you madam
chair

01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah well this this part five
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
certainly uh makes this a true omnibus
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill in that it doesn't have a lot to do
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
with election law as far as i can tell
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
but um but having said that um
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
it is in the new hampshire constitution
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
that each county have a
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
register of probate that does
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
the work that needs to be that's
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
required under probate
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
um and in 2011 we heard testimony that
 
01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
um and in 2011 we heard testimony that
that

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility got shifted to the
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
area and um you know there's certainly
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
in my mind there's some merit to putting
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
it back where the constitution says it
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
for one reason um like the rest of us in
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
the room i
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
took an oath to uphold the new hampshire
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
constitution and it seems like
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
this got put in the wrong place as far
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
as the constitution was concerned
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
but the other part is that we did also
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
hear testimony that
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
suggested and i've never been through
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
the probate process so i can't speak
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
um you know firsthand on that
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
um is less responsive than it may
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
have been in may and should be if it
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
were if the process was where
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution said it should be with
 
01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:34.950 align:start position:0%
the constitution said it should be with
the

01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the register of probate um
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
at the county level so that's my comment
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
i you know i don't i'm not sure
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
um you know the best way to handle this
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
i know there's problems with with money
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
um uh because this doesn't seem to fund
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
if if we decide that this is what we
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
should do
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
there is not money to fund that that um
 
01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
there is not money to fund that that um
activity

01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
at the county level um and so that would
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
be something that would have to be
 
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.950 align:start position:0%
be something that would have to be
addressed

01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
but anyway those are some of my thoughts
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald thank you madam
 
01:38:20.639 --> 01:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald thank you madam
chairman

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
um i've uh you know talked to a number
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
of people on this
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
on this issue and you know
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
this whole situation was changed
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
originally for a reason
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
working out effectively uh and i
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
understand it's in the constitution an
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
effort was made to take it out of the
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
constitution and we know how
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments how
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
successful they usually are but to bring
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
this position back without a support
 
01:38:48.719 --> 01:38:49.750 align:start position:0%
this position back without a support
staff

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
without proper funding without any
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
training without even a clear place
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
as to where that person is going to be
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
working i don't think makes any sense at
 
01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
working i don't think makes any sense at
all

01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
i i guess my point on this section would
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
be you either want it in or you want it
 
01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:13.910 align:start position:0%
be you either want it in or you want it
out

01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it appeared to be a
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
section that as
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
content of it itself that there was a
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
lot of wordsmithing
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative growing representative
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
that our constitution requires this and
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
i wasn't very excited about it in 2011
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
i remember dealing with this when i was
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
in the senate but
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
at this point it seems to me kind of
 
01:40:00.159 --> 01:40:00.870 align:start position:0%
at this point it seems to me kind of
like

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
um requiring us to reintroduce brakeman
 
01:40:04.639 --> 01:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
um requiring us to reintroduce brakeman
that

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
would reside in the caboose of a train
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
that would have no function other than
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
to sit there
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i the the the responsibilities of
 
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.830 align:start position:0%
and i the the the responsibilities of
this

01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
of this position have been given to the
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
court and
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
for the most part i think we're going to
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
have a person without a position
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments other than
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
that i request
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
permission to use putting somebody in
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
the caboose with no breaks
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
work in the future
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.199 --> 01:40:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
we will see it again madam chair no
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
matter what happens no matter what
 
01:41:00.639 --> 01:41:02.229 align:start position:0%
matter what happens no matter what
happens

01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
we will we will maybe not in election
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
law but
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
it will be seen again all right any
 
01:41:08.719 --> 01:41:09.669 align:start position:0%
it will be seen again all right any
other

01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
comments from community members all
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
right we've had a
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh i i think we've had a consensus
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
on a couple of sections of bills as to
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
changes that may need to be made
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of volunteers for
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
amendments we've had somebody
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
already do an amendment um
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
and maybe persons are going to do other
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
amendments on on different parts
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
we will not be having an executive
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
session next week
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite sure at this point when
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be scheduled but it will
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
not be next week and part of the point
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
of that was so that if people wanted to
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
do further amendments
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
or have some more discussions about this
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill you have the ample
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to before executive session
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
because i do anticipate we're going to
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
have to deal with
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
um probably series of amendments on
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
various parts of these bills
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i will let you know as soon as i've
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
got it figured out for executive session
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate a need to meet as a
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee before the executive session
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other business
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
they want to bring before the committee
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
this morning or this afternoon we did
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
make it into afternoon
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sure could i just ask that if people
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
are preparing amendments that they
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
distribute them as promptly as possible
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and pam um if you're
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
still on
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to make it thank you
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
um i want to make it clear that as to
 
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.189 align:start position:0%
um i want to make it clear that as to
these

01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendments we'd be dealing with them as
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
we would with amendments in
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
any bill if we're addressing a
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
particular part of a bill
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
and we have successive successive
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendments that they would essentially
 
01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:02.709 align:start position:0%
amendments that they would essentially
be

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
overlaid as to the previous amendments
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
and then incorporated into
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
the final house bill as amended do i
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
have that process correct
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
or not well if i understood you
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
um yes i mean i think
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
if you have multiple amendments
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
um that are adopted to one of the
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills they would need to be
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
unified after the executive session into
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
a single amendment
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
um that would appear in the house
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
calendar they would not be
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
remain as separate amendments for the
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
individual parts of the omnibus they'd
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
all be
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
rolled into one but each individual
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that is worked on
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know it makes sense to to address
 
01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.629 align:start position:0%
you know it makes sense to to address
them

01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
as a single part okay
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking and i i would
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
ask that that any amendments that come
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
through um if people could include me on
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
the distribution list i'm not on the
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee distribution list but it would
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
be helpful if
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
if i had them so i can make sure they're
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
the room for people to come in person on
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
the day of the exec
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
and also have them to to make that
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
combined amendment
