00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 align:start position:0%

i am present at my home and mr chair uh
 
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
just a slight correction
 
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
this is technically a
 
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee executive session it can't
 
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
be an executive session until we have
 
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
the whole community you are correct
 
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 align:start position:0%
we are just the subcommittee is
 
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
she's going to vote on the
 
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh on our
 
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
work on the two bills
 
00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
he did announce it was a subcommittee
 
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
he did announce it was a subcommittee
meeting

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes but he also stated during his spiel
 
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
that it was an executive session so yeah
 
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess technically we're just
 
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
voting voting a recommendation on the on
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
the amendments and that's technically
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
not all right thank you yes and myself
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm chairman of pearson
 
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the room all right so we'll start
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
with 58.
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
substantially lengthy but it was due to
 
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
the repetition of
 
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
the various
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
boards and the consistency that was
 
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.509 align:start position:0%
boards and the consistency that was
being

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
desired across the plc
 
00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
took care of some of the concern or
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
about some of the concerns all of the
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that the subcommittee had
 
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
concerns that the subcommittee had
brought

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
especially when it came to the
 
00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
signature part and
 
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.949 align:start position:0%
signature part and
the

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
references that
 
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative golding made
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
concerning the
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
consultation with the appropriate boards
 
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.110 align:start position:0%
consultation with the appropriate boards
or

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
hiring of investigators and legal
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
services and that sort of thing so
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
that you all had a
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
chance to peruse it i've discussed this

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
i noticed on page three
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%

three well yeah i think it's page three
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
of of the amendment also since it
 
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.349 align:start position:0%
of of the amendment also since it
basically

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
likes the entire
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
reiterates the entire bill technically
 
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i mean it's the same in both
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i mean it's the same in both
[Music]

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's line 14 in the original bill
 
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
and it's also it's a strikeout it's also
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
struck out in the amendment
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
and it talks about maintaining a roster
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
bill from
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
certain practice acts that contain that
 
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.990 align:start position:0%
certain practice acts that contain that
language

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
is a separate document that some boards
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
have maintained
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
and charged people a fee
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
for um we we don't think that it made
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
sense to be doing that
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
particularly because it's available for
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
free on the web
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and it just requires us to maintain a
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
separate list and
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
um is is more burdensome to administer
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we would still be maintaining our
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
licensee look up through the online
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
portal just not maintaining a separate
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
public list that's available for
 
00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.430 align:start position:0%
public list that's available for
purchase

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh i assume and hope that uh there
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
reference if someone went to
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
the acupuncturist's
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
individual location referring people
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
interested to look at your
 
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.070 align:start position:0%
interested to look at your
uh

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
compilation list i'll call it
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
yes so if you go to our new website um
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's a whole uh there's a tab a new
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
section that says licensee look up for
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
individuals to go and look up a license
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
and i believe there's a separate tab on
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
each board webpage as well that is a
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
question that we get frequently
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
um so we're trying to make it
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
easier for people to access
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
it makes sense like i said i just i
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
would think if somebody was looking for
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
a specific profession
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
they would go to that board so i just
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that there's something
 
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to direct them to where
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
they can find that
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
so just a reminder for those out in
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
cyberspace the purpose of this senate
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill is to
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
provide consistency and some
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
standardization across
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
rewards when it comes to the
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
operations of oplc specifically
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the boards have retained their
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
ability to function in
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of thomas so
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's no other concerns
 
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.950 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's no other concerns
on

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
the work that was done in the amendment
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
the final amendment that was drafted
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't have i think that
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
this was this was laid out as uh
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
and our concerns were well addressed in
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
the one spot where we weren't quite
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
consistent across the plc took care of
 
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.509 align:start position:0%
consistent across the plc took care of
so

00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.310 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
anything

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
no i'm good
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
excellent so if we're all good then
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
we'll just take a subcommittee
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation vote on uh
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
what would be now known as the pearson
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
and i'll uh
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
i'll call the role for for the
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
and representative schuett
 
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
and representative schuett
yes

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
all right next is according to one of
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
the clocks in the room
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're not the same well we have
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
technically three minutes or so before
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
we move on to 104 so just take a moment
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
to peruse
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.000 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:05.650 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.949 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going over my notes on 104 and
 
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going over my notes on 104 and
there

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
by comparison to 58 virtually none um
 
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
by comparison to 58 virtually none um
just

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.829 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
the hang up was
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
very quiet
 
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.350 align:start position:0%
very quiet
sure

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you say what could i just
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
review what the amendment included
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah what what was changed
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
sure entire amendment to the pearson
 
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.829 align:start position:0%
sure entire amendment to the pearson
amendment

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.430 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
we the the first thing we did was in in
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
part one which um outlines the
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
the uh unclassified positions that have
 
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
the uh unclassified positions that have
been

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
voted on by the joint committee on
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
employee classification it already had
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
some votes from last year but the the
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
joint committee just met a couple of
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and approved some new
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
unclassified salary changes and so those
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
were incorporated into the amendment to
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
to bring everything
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
all of their work up to date in the
 
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
all of their work up to date in the
statutes

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
in in part two of the amendment
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we we took the
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
carson amendment that had been a
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
separate amendment that dealt with
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
reverse auctions and incorporated that
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
into part two
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
we added a new part three
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
using the mcguire amendment which
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
had the
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
organization of the department of
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
administrative services changes that
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
talked to you about so so it was a
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
relatively simple amendment we just
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
lifted those separate amendments and put
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
them all into one that's why i don't
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of notes on it right
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
nomination of the various parts into one
 
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.030 align:start position:0%
nomination of the various parts into one
document

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:16.650 align:start position:0%
document
awesome

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:16.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
rp 945 i'll open the subcommittee
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 104.
 
00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 104.
the

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
this is recorded it doesn't stop
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
recording as it was previously stated
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
enough to repeat it the carson amendment
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the mcguire amendment and the
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
new classifications that jcec had
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
just worked out
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
have now been
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
incorporated into one document
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
did not
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
have any issues originally with changing
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
anything which was fantastic it was just
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
merge all these together to form one
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%

public hearing it will have to be
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
extremely relevant
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
could you say to us again from deep
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
you said dhs or d-e-s
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
administrative services administrative
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh testified at the original hearing and
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
answered lengthy questions in my notes
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
yep i know we had concerns
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
we asked questions in reference to what
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
jcec was doing
 
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.710 align:start position:0%
jcec was doing
um

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
and that's the timing of that so
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad that we're able to
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
incorporate their recent
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
work into this so we don't have to wait
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.910 align:start position:0%
a year
right

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
we've probably already waited a year
 
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.350 align:start position:0%
we've probably already waited a year
actually

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well like i said there's no sense
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
in putting it off if we can get it done
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm good with this the melding of this
 
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:24.629 align:start position:0%
i'm good with this the melding of this
together

00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting mr chairman um
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
just to state for the record
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
of this meeting uh
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
as um one of the members of the
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
jcec and as a former chair
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.710 align:start position:0%
jcec and as a former chair
uh

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
i've experienced in this matter and
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
and pam is our staffer on jcec so she is
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
a a long time staffer of the jcec so she
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
also would have a lot of
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
information if there were any issues
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
that needed to be addressed
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
all right an advantage
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
certainly i have a question on the
 
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
certainly i have a question on the
amendment

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
which one
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
at the very end on the effective dates
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i could have very well gotten this
 
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.350 align:start position:0%
and i could have very well gotten this
wrong

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
my scribbled notes during our meeting
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
part three for administrative services
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
being added in the effect dates at the
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
end and i see that but i had also
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
after

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh on the effective dates and i don't
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
know maybe it was decided that
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
that wasn't needed but i don't see part
 
00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:49.029 align:start position:0%
that wasn't needed but i don't see part
four

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
specifically listed in the effective
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
dates of the amendment
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
so maybe ms smarling could tell us
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
if i got that wrong or what
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of a part four we we had
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
originally the bill had only two parts
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
and then we added a a third
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know what
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
part four would be referring to i'm not
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
sure what i was referring to okay
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
like i said i put part three after the
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps you're just preparing yourself
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
to write part four if there were one
 
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.350 align:start position:0%
to write part four if there were one
maybe

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of a discussion of a part
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah this is uh this has
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
does what it needs because this is not a
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
full right this is uh it's almost a full
 
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
full right this is uh it's almost a full
rewrite

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
rewrite
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
but not not quite
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
not entirely right right so the
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
effective dates for each section do
 
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.909 align:start position:0%
effective dates for each section do
exist

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
one of which is specific to july 1 which
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
is if the score opens
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then the other part two was sixty
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
with sixty days
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
yep six part one is sixty days part two
 
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.789 align:start position:0%
yep six part one is sixty days part two
is

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
so we do have effective dates for
 
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.390 align:start position:0%
so we do have effective dates for
this

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
now where we are it's going to push it
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
into the next july 1.
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
do we have
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
effective date for part one
 
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.430 align:start position:0%
effective date for part one
yes

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
will be located online 21
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
part one of this actually take effect 60
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
days after it's passed okay
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
so so part one and two are going to push
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
past into the end of july depending on
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
how fast this makes it through i mean if
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
it gets the recession that's the first
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
week of june which will be august
 
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:07.830 align:start position:0%
week of june which will be august
actually

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then part of the third part
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
will go in effect july 1st of this year
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
according to the amendment correct okay
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
if there's no other questions we'll just
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands raised
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
all right marvelous well then let's uh
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%

two sessions here to
 
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought up during
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
both the public hearing and in
 
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.430 align:start position:0%
both the public hearing and in
subcommittee

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
sessions the
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
this basically boils down to is oplc is
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and as it should be trying to remind its
 
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
and as it should be trying to remind its
operations

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
so you can do that there were some
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies across the
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
54 wars and
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
this is not um
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is not to
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
advance the force itself it is just to
 
01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.829 align:start position:0%
advance the force itself it is just to
work

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
the particulars of the commonalities
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
across the operations of oplc
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee did work on that was a
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
change to the original bill was we
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
removed the requirement for physical
 
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
removed the requirement for physical
signatures

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
signatures
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh in this age of
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
websites electronic meetings and such it
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
seemed to be very burdensome to
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
to require those to be physically done
 
01:06:57.599 --> 01:06:59.589 align:start position:0%
to require those to be physically done
so

01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
amongst amongst a couple other changes
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
that was that was one that was kind of a
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
big one the other thing of course if you
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
recall from the hearing is we were all
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
kind of taken aback a little bit of the
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
fact that oplc issued 25 000 temporary
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
licenses last year which is uh
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
which was a staggering number pretty
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
much all of us so
 
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
much all of us so
um

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
but yeah the subcommittee voted 5-0 to
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
approve the
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
final amendment to the bill which
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
rewrites the entire
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
after the basically the inaction
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
sentence at the beginning so it is a
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:37.700 align:start position:0%
okay representation
 
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.589 align:start position:0%
okay representation

subcommittee
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
for going through this

praise from from your constituents

i do thank you madam chair the
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment it is in a couple of parts
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's in particular three parts so the
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
first part covers the
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
classification of certain jobs within
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
puts them into their salary
 
01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.310 align:start position:0%
puts them into their salary
classification

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
classification
 
01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.110 align:start position:0%
classification
the

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee jcec which is the
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee that looks at salaries within
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
the state actually had just met prior to
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
our work so we were able to
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate the new work of that
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee into this
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
amendment which is uh
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
quite timely considering that usually
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
they get stuck waiting a year for things
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
to catch up so we were we were happy to
 
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:26.709 align:start position:0%
to catch up so we were we were happy to
come

01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
oblige their
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
the timing of that and bring that into
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
part one with the classifications the
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
second part
 
01:14:34.239 --> 01:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
second part
is

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
just really
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
has to do with the um reverse the
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
concept of reverse auctions
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is it is not what you see on
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
television as far as like selling your
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
home and that kind of thing this is more
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
of a procurement thing where
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
it gives the the state a little bit of a
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
ability to to get work done at all
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
at a lower cost the third part
 
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.950 align:start position:0%
at a lower cost the third part
involved

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
services

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
some title changes of some jobs that i
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
guess we just we don't call them what we
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
used to so there was that and then
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing was just the way
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
um the commissioners have the ability to
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
appoint their deputies
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
so and that's pretty much uh
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
the gist of that there was a little bit
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
of language cleanup again like i said
 
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.790 align:start position:0%
of language cleanup again like i said
with

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
things aren't
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
called what they used to be called but
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much straightforward with
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
with 104. and the subcommittee was
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
the blending of of the three original
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
amendments into the final this final
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendment okay
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
as before i think the subcommittee chair
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that one of the
 
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.910 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that one of the
things

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
part three does
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
is that it
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
moves a number of the top level
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
employees and administrative services
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
from classified to unclassified
 
01:16:23.199 --> 01:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
from classified to unclassified
positions

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
which is more appropriate for that level
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
other questions comments concerns
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair i made uh one one
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
been tangentially discussed this morning
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
or mentioned uh is that
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
the as the executive department the
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
branch of uh
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
of the government
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
modifies work procedures and so forth
 
01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.750 align:start position:0%
modifies work procedures and so forth
and

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately those changes need to be
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
reflected in the job title that was
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier but
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
in in accordance with uh
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement uh we have to
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
change uh the statute to reflect
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
not merely the job title but also the
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
job description uh which is um
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
a part of the whole process so
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's one of the functions of jcec
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
which has not yet been described to the
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee so just mentioning that so
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's job title and description uh have
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
to be changed to modify and modify to
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
reflect what the employee's actually
 
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:49.990 align:start position:0%
reflect what the employee's actually
doing

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh in many cases
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that we are in sync
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh something we should keep in mind as
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
we adopt these measures
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we are making our statutes reflect
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
reality thank you

01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
sort of the draft the subcommittee draft
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
for 133 down to the committee room and
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
emailed it to all the members this
 
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.470 align:start position:0%
emailed it to all the members this
morning

01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
so you
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to do something similar
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
for 133 that's an option you have a
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
document you could work from
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
and and also um dr warner's suggestion
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
for amendments to part 12. i don't know
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to address that but that
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
is has been sent around and and copies
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
um are in the committee room as well
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've already voted on every section of
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
133 we're just waiting for the final
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
amendment i would rather do 155 first
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
and then reconsider part 12 if we wish
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
to afterwards okay i'm just just
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
throwing it out there right
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
pam do you have um the collection of
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
changes to 155 handy that we're going to
 
01:23:29.679 --> 01:23:31.189 align:start position:0%
changes to 155 handy that we're going to
be

01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
and not not immediately handy i was
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay i do have it in front of me now
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
1443 h is down in the committee room
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's the amount right that's the
 
01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:12.740 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
 
01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
[Music]

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have an amendment for
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
155 yet but are you looking for general
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i think we could provide general
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
information as to what
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
we did with house bill 155 and
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that what you're looking
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
for madam chair are you looking for
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
exact wording
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the most part
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you have exact wording i would very
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
much like to use it if you do not have
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
an exact wording
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
consider the intent
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
i i believe miss smarling has the exact
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
wording we submitted to her on each
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
 
01:24:49.199 --> 01:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
yes

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay so go through
 
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.229 align:start position:0%
okay so go through
um

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
section one temporary health department
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
what did
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative roy what did you do with
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
so we decided that um we wanted to have
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
a definition of what temporary health
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
partner means
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
um since there was not one in the bill
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
so we came up with a definition and mr
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
marlin could perhaps read that for us
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure it's it's relatively brief so
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will be relatively painless
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
we say for the purposes of this section
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
temporary health partner means a health
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
partner who has been hired under the
 
01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.990 align:start position:0%
partner who has been hired under the
processes

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
authorized according to federal and
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
state waivers
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and that was um in response to
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
um representative goalie had brought up
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
the point that you know and we all
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
agreed that we did not want to create a
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
permanent subclass
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
of lna
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
that would just stay there at a lower
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
pay rate in replace of regular lnas
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
so what we wanted was um something that
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
provided a pathway for people only who
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
were hired during this emergency and
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
received waivers once the emergency is
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
over and the waivers are done so this
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
program ends with it
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
and so do the opportunities for them to
 
01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.270 align:start position:0%
and so do the opportunities for them to
use

01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
the hours they've collected towards
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
getting their lna
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
we discussed with the
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
nursing people about bringing back new
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
would perhaps provide a
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
alternate pathway for people to get
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
their lna but that would be something
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
addressed later on but for the purposes
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
of this section this is only for people
 
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
of this section this is only for people
hired

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
hired
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
using waivers from the
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
emergency orders and when the emergency
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i hope representative goalie that
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
addressed the concerns you have
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
yes it does thank you representative
 
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.950 align:start position:0%
yes it does thank you representative
representative

01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes i think that this is fantastic and i
 
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.149 align:start position:0%
yes i think that this is fantastic and i
think

01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
put a pen in this for the futures i
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
think we should look at this as
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
something to go beyond
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
um to to extend beyond that time frame
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
i think this is a great pathway that
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
can create a good career for folks
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
child yes
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the general question is there's still
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
such a thing as an lpn
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes that's a more skilled position okay
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
but that exists this hasn't been
 
01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
but that exists this hasn't been
mentioned

01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
yeah that's one above lna i believe
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's also referenced on line 11.
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
i understand the change we just talked
 
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
i understand the change we just talked
about

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
is that section going to have an expired
 
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.390 align:start position:0%
is that section going to have an expired
date

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future
 
01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.270 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future
so

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
if the emergency orders expire the the
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
pool of
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
eligible people won't expand but
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have some kind of expiry
 
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.790 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have some kind of expiry
date

01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know several years out from now
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
the waiver has a
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
an expiration date at the end of the
 
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.629 align:start position:0%
an expiration date at the end of the
emergency

01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
so you can't hire new people from that
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
um there's another thing i should have
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned i i apologize we the other
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
change that the subcommittee agreed to
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
rather than um amend rsa 326b as as is
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
done in the bill as um
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
adopted by the senate we've made it
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
session law so it still remains in
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
effect until repealed but it's it's not
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
a sort of permanent looking position uh
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
section in the the nurse practice act
 
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.310 align:start position:0%
section in the the nurse practice act
so

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
and and of course what representative
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
mcguire just said is is correct when the
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
waivers disappear the the
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
or at the very least i can't hire
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
anybody new
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we have in senate bill 133 a way for
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
them to apply for an lna license
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
but we would after the end of the
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
emergency you can't hire any more
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
temporary health classes
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
right and since we put it in session law
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
it will not be there cluttering up
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
permanently the uh the section related
 
01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
permanently the uh the section related
to

01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.070 align:start position:0%
to
l

01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair i i would like to
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
say that uh these people are already
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
helping us out right now and doing an
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily important
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
job of making it possible for the
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
trained nursing staff
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
the things that they alone are trained
 
01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
the things that they alone are trained
for

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
functions that the uh that these
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
temporary health workers helpers are
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
doing are
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely crucial
 
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.189 align:start position:0%
absolutely crucial
uh

01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:41.199 --> 01:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
uh
for

01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh these frail patients who are in many
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
cases are unable to feed themselves or
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
toilet themselves and so forth
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
and without these functions performed
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
they can't survive here in these nursing
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
homes so these these workers are vital
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
and they have responded to this pandemic
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
stepped forward
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
and this it would be a way for them to
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
work their way up to lna uh as the
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
situation comes along and and
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
in advance that grade when this position
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
goes away at the end of the pandemic
 
01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
goes away at the end of the pandemic
so

01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
very important what they're doing
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
indeed any any other comments questions
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
um can you read the title off for me i
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
don't have the document in front of me
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
authorizes emergency licensing of
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to step in if you
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
would like
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
if you would please what we should
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
sure if um if looking at the bill is
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate on page three
 
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.310 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate on page three
um

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
lines 16 through 22
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
current and former military service
 
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.950 align:start position:0%
current and former military service
members

01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
and how they
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
could be i could apply for a nursing
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
assistant license as well as emts and
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
since those
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
both those categories of people were
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in house bill 567 the
 
01:32:19.199 --> 01:32:20.470 align:start position:0%
addressed in house bill 567 the
subcommittee

01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
removed both of those paragraphs from
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
and and i just noticed as i was looking
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
at this that that there is there are two
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph fours so we there's a
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph four on on line nine and a
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph four on line 16 right below it
 
01:32:36.239 --> 01:32:37.270 align:start position:0%
paragraph four on line 16 right below it
so

01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
um make sure that we
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't delete both of them
 
01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.790 align:start position:0%
don't delete both of them
but

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's the substance of of the
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's work to remove those two
 
01:32:46.719 --> 01:32:47.910 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's work to remove those two
paragraphs

01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
and if you recall uh representative
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair that that was at your behalf
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
that we um we that already existed in in
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
another statute
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
and pam will that require renumbering of
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
the of the page if we do that
 
01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.310 align:start position:0%
the of the page if we do that
yes

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.189 align:start position:0%
yes
but

01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
it'll require
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
changing roman 6 to romans 5.
 
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.229 align:start position:0%
changing roman 6 to romans 5.
right

01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
won't affect the other paragraph four
 
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.350 align:start position:0%
won't affect the other paragraph four
okay

01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
right we'll just make sure that we get
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
by the executive session we noticed
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
that there were two section fours
 
01:33:30.159 --> 01:33:31.270 align:start position:0%
that there were two section fours
anything

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions comments or concerns on this
 
01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
questions comments or concerns on this
change

01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
that so section three is about
 
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.550 align:start position:0%
that so section three is about
pharmacists

01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacists
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
um i believe i believe we thought that
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
was a good idea miss marlin did we make
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
any changes to that section
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
i no we did not no so we we thought that
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
that was a good idea
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
um to allow the pharmacist's assistance
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
concern that was brought up by
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
the chair of hhs that they had
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist vaccines
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
in a different field
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
which i thought i had sent to
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
smarling but it did not include the
 
01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:32.470 align:start position:0%
smarling but it did not include the
testing

01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
01:34:34.239 --> 01:34:35.350 align:start position:0%
so let's
connect

01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
connect
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
look at that and take out the
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinations because
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the vaccine section
 
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the vaccine section
was

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the other bills number i forget was
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
more thorough and better integrated
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i thought that was in section four
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
i thought we were going to look at that
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it was covered before
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
we agreed to delete it to make sure that
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
the language was adequate
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
side by side did we get that smart
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
oh i did not
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
know about that request
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
the testing is new in this bill and
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
should stay but the vaccination part we
 
01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure doesn't
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
contradict what
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
another committee's done on a different
 
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
another committee's done on a different
field

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
right and so that's section five
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
correct uh section three
 
01:35:30.239 --> 01:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
correct uh section three
section

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
the second uh
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
i had thought that that's the one that
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted to remove section five
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
relative to the pharmacy tech
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
administration of vaccines
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
sections 3 and 4
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.149 align:start position:0%
sections 3 and 4
are

01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
about testing
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't that's duplicated anywhere
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
section 5. is
 
01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.870 align:start position:0%
section 5. is
um

01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
um
again

01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
we don't object to the idea we just
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to duplicate effort
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
right and that
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
that was the section i had thought we
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
were talking about removing
 
01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
were talking about removing
yes

01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
i have the number of the other bill by
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the chance anyone
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh 572
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
then on page five we go on to the next
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
section which is out of state pharmacy
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
as temporary limited licensed mail-order
 
01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:44.629 align:start position:0%
as temporary limited licensed mail-order
facilities

01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
and that that one we also agreed was a
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
good idea um
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we did not if i recall make any
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
changes to that
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.550 align:start position:0%
that's correct
um

01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
this would uh allow the out-of-state
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacies to fulfill these
 
01:37:00.159 --> 01:37:02.149 align:start position:0%
pharmacies to fulfill these
prescriptions

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah these are um
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's a very limited number of things
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's uh prescriptions for people who are
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a general thing
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
right and it saves people from having to
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
drive a long way to get their
 
01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.109 align:start position:0%
drive a long way to get their
prescriptions

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that would not otherwise be available
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and i believe
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative luck has spoke to that
 
01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.510 align:start position:0%
representative luck has spoke to that
personally

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
and the next is
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
protection of pre-existing
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
non-conforming use status for summer
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
games this one we did make some
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
significant changes to um
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
with regard i believe to a sunset and to
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
summer camps that were grandfathered did
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
not lose that status in the future mr
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
smalling do you have the language we
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative lekkis worked on
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
this section i'm sure he'll he he can
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
talk about it as well but basically he
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
he extended it to apply to summer camps
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
that were under operation in 2021
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
either it's currently
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
for the camps
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
that were closed rather in 2020 and
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's extended to include
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
um 2021.
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
or 2020.
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and and we there was a lot of
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether the sunset
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
should apply
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
and it was determined that it should not
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
that it should remain in the statute
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
just so summer camps that might have
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
sort of lapsed during this covid period
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to point to a
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
a clear law say in 2025 to show why they
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
had not been in operation
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's right thank you for
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
refreshing my memory we decided that if
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the road um the status of
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
a summer camp were challenged because of
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
their inability to operate these during
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
these two years
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
they would be able to point to the
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
specific statute that authorized them to
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
we added 2021 in addition because this
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't just
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
it can't be closed
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
but if they're operating at reduced
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
capacity because there might be some
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
requirements around that
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the concern is that we hope it's not
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to happen but it's possible
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
some camps could experience that this
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions on
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
but we're happy with that one
 
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.310 align:start position:0%
but we're happy with that one
uh

01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
next section is on continuing
 
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
next section is on continuing
construction

01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
can you read that again i didn't hear
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
what you said is on what
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
continuing construction during covet 19.
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
um okay so i don't know that we made any
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
changes to this one this morning did we
 
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.750 align:start position:0%
changes to this one this morning did we
represent

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
karen i believe we removed the whole
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
section because uh the testimony we got
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
indicated it was no longer an issue
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's right it was um
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct we we struck the entire
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
section because
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
um it really wasn't if
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
it didn't matter anymore at this point
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
because everything was opened back up
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
when construction had started again
 
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
when construction had started again
okay

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay section nine outdoor dinings
 
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.270 align:start position:0%
okay section nine outdoor dinings
[Music]

01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh this one uh representative grotto put
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of work into for us um checking on
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
it and uh i let her go ahead and tell us
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
what she came up with
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure there were two uh concerns one
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
had to do with um des and sept and those
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh phys those um businesses on subject
 
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.350 align:start position:0%
uh phys those um businesses on subject
systems

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
so it was uh the amendment
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me um addresses that concern by
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
those um establishments on septic
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
systems if they have um if they want to
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
have a capacity
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
larger than what they have um
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
that what they're normally allotted they
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
have to have review of their success
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
their system with des
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
per ds rsas and there is a let a
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
sentence in there that reinforces local
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
control in that all outdoor dining those
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
facilities that are not that are on
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
municipal systems
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
have to um follow the municipal
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines and the the you know the
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
municipality makes the decisions on that
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it gives local control to those
 
01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.070 align:start position:0%
so it gives local control to those
facilities

01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
if you'd like me to read the exact
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
sentences i can do that if you prefer
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay no i think that makes sense
 
01:42:15.679 --> 01:42:18.310 align:start position:0%
okay no i think that makes sense
uh

01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
i did i did hear from um yesterday from
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
someone from the liquor commission
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and they were requesting something
 
01:42:25.679 --> 01:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
um and they were requesting something
about

01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
having the statute put in the
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
having any change to the statute put in
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
with their their existing statutes and
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
he's supposed to be sending me
 
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
he's supposed to be sending me
um

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
specific language as to where they would
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
like that place
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
so once i get that um we'll represent
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
that to the committee just to
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
button that down i think that if if i
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
remember the discussion correctly it's
 
01:42:50.719 --> 01:42:52.950 align:start position:0%
remember the discussion correctly it's
178.24

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
178.24
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
which talks about
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
authorization for other areas
 
01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.070 align:start position:0%
authorization for other areas
um

01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
they they include that already has the
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for local local control and
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
local approval
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
and uh so anything that we you think you
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
need to add
 
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.550 align:start position:0%
need to add
in

01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
would would go
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
much more conveniently and that's in
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
that section of statute rather than
 
01:43:18.159 --> 01:43:20.070 align:start position:0%
that section of statute rather than
creating

01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay and that's the that's the last of
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
it other than the prospective repeals
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
and the effective dates
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has her
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
yes i just had
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
a question about the end date for the
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining did you change that or is
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
it still through
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
i do not believe we changed it did we
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
represent um smiling
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for the promotion though
 
01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:11.669 align:start position:0%
thanks for the promotion though
um

01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
we did not change that uh representative
 
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
we did not change that uh representative
fellows

01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and in in closing i would just like
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
to say a pox on the senate for all these
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh omnibus bills
 
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i just
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
i thought this goes to representative
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
roy i thought we had discussed changing
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
it uh to 2022
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
knowing that they would give two full
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
years and if it needed to be extended
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
out we could do that further on but uh
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to the end of 2023 seemed kind of
 
01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
going to the end of 2023 seemed kind of
lengthy

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
lengthy
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if he recalls that
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
discussion or not but i thought we were
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
going to change the end date
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
i recall that true
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
i i do recall that um i don't know that
 
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.270 align:start position:0%
i i do recall that um i don't know that
um

01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative grota didn't put
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
that in her
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis has a comment on
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that specific issue
 
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.430 align:start position:0%
that specific issue
representative

01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
the businesses to if they haven't
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
already expanded the outdoor dining
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's a certain amount of investment
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
in that to give them
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we took a formal vote
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the committee but
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
yeah if i recall the the reasons i'm
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
trying to remember who who testified um
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
but they they indicated that it would
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
give the businesses some some sense of
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
security as far as planning and
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
investment to at least know that they
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
had um another year without having to
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to make investments and
 
01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.590 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to make investments and
such

01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's great there was we had um let me
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
just think about who that would be
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
it was the municipal association perhaps
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
the municipal association i think was
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
margaret burns actually and i she um
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned that and this is you know i
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
know this is true in our own town
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
these businesses that are either having
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining are making significant
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
investments with
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
making things look less
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
more aesthetically pleasing
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
in order to um
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
they are they're wanting to make sure
 
01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.910 align:start position:0%
they are they're wanting to make sure
that

01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
should things continue they can can they
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
can continue to have these outdoor
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
dining through
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's how i think about this isn't that
 
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
the date that that we discussed madam
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
chair for me yes representative goalie
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly the discussion
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
was around the date and we the
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussion was that
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
they have all of this year
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
and all of 2022 which is two full
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
summers um
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
to get through this
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
and if need be
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
in 2022 if we need to go a third year
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
it could be extended at that time but i
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
thought the discussion was 2022 would
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
suffice and if needed we could extend it
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
out but this gives cities and towns two
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
full summers
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
and into the fall
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
of next year
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
to get through this and
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
gives us time to reassess if we go to
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
2022 as to whether or not it's needed in
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
2023. i think that's what the discussion
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
was that i recall
 
01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.790 align:start position:0%
was that i recall
okay

01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
your discussion is correct but i thought
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
we had another meeting that you weren't
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
you had a comment yeah i just uh said it
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
was interesting that the support for uh
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
keeping it extended inside of the call i
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
think you're right it was from uh
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
somebody from the municipal association
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
a little surprising but
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
i just i i seem to recall we had a
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
second meeting on this subcommittee and
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if representative goalie
 
01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:28.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if representative goalie
was

01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
present when we heard that testimony
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
i was not there
 
01:48:37.199 --> 01:48:38.149 align:start position:0%
i was not there
okay

01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
that case well i think
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
if there's still a question about it
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh the lat
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
from listening to people the
 
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.350 align:start position:0%
from listening to people the
um

01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
the summation that i hear is that
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be no change
 
01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
there's going to be no change
to

01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like i'd like to hear it
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative roy do you have a do you
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
plan to bring that up again
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
um based on the the testimony we heard
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
from the municipal association i did not
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
intend to to change it um
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
the only the only contrary um with
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
respect was representative goalie and i
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
understand where he's coming from
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
but based on the request of the people
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
actually out there dealing with it we
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm pretty um switzerland either way
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
represent fellows
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair i'm i'd just like
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
to say that that i'm
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
fine with keeping the date the way it is
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
now that i've heard the explanation i
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
listened to some of the subcommittee
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
meetings but i didn't listen to the
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that i listened to the first
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
discussion when it sounded like we were
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
going to change the date and i didn't
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
hear the second part so i'm i'm fine
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
i also think that if i may that's it i
 
01:50:19.590 --> 01:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
mean it doesn't mean i'm sorry this is i
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
should i i i meant to raise my hand
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i also um
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is this this is a sunset sunset
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
date but it doesn't mean that it can't
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
happen before that and that's why
 
01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
putting it under local control and
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
leaving it under local control is
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
important because for example in the
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
city of portsmouth if this gets to be
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
too cumbersome
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
and it's not needed then the city
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
themselves can the city council can
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
decide on their own as long as they're
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
following the rules
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
or if
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
if nashville for example decides that
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
they really need those two lanes of main
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
street again
 
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.229 align:start position:0%
street again
right

01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
downstream they they can
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
do that on a
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you call my name you
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
broke up
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's important we all know uh
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
how much restaurants uh have suffered as
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
a result of the pandemic uh and this is
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh to do as much as we can
 
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.070 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh to do as much as we can
always

01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
leaving the local control as a as an
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
important aspect
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
but to do as much as we can to try to do
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
the right thing here and now that we
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
have the full committee assembled and
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative judy has joined us as
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
some of you may have noticed uh i think
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
that to try to get the combined wisdom
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee a number of the members
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
are from the smaller towns
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
where it's a
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
different situation to some degree than
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
it is uh in the larger cities such as we
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
have um so i think we ought to try and
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
resolve this to the to the greatest
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
extent we can in favor of the
 
01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:20.350 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%

01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
the temporary health partners will be
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%

01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
has given us some additional language
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
and which she has discussed with you i'm
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
told uh and also with she has discussed
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
it with lindsay courtney she is here uh
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
that is to say dr warner is with us and
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering whether
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we can deal with this
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
reconsideration motion uh at this time
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
or when you would like to do it let's
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
put it that way
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
let's do it now
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
motion is
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
i move to reconsider on
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh that portion i don't have the thing
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
citation in front of me uh
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the bill with regard to telehealth
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
for psychologists
 
01:55:56.719 --> 01:55:58.070 align:start position:0%
for psychologists
um

01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we we had a a
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
successful committee vote but doctor but
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
we never got to dr warner's first
 
01:56:07.199 --> 01:56:08.229 align:start position:0%
we never got to dr warner's first
amendment

01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:56:08.239 --> 01:56:09.270 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
she i thought she was here and i was
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
trying to contact her she had to step
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
away at just the inopportune moment so
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm moving reconsideration on that
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
particular item
 
01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:23.830 align:start position:0%
particular item
that's

01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.109 align:start position:0%
that's
section

01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
of senator 133
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
and we adopted an amendment that
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
talked the language about
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
the telepaths
 
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:35.420 align:start position:0%
the telepaths
and

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:35.430 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:39.270 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
simply said that people that a temporary
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
emergency license can apply for a full
 
01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.510 align:start position:0%
emergency license can apply for a full
license

01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
not creating a movement
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
your understanding
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding madam chair and
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
as i say dr warner is with us right now
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
so she can testify to that if it's
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
if that meets with your approval
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes we need to repeat vote to
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
reconsider first
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
i understand that but i'm just pointing
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
out that this is an opportune moment if
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
it meets your approval
 
01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
it meets your approval
so

01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
let's see what the sense of the
 
01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.189 align:start position:0%
let's see what the sense of the
committee

01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
to you to all of you by last night so
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
that you'd have it as early as possible
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
this morning or very late last night i
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for it but
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
didn't have the language until late
 
01:57:32.239 --> 01:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
didn't have the language until late
myself

01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who wishes to speak on
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
no it's a perfectly germane amendment as
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
i understand it the latest language that
 
01:57:54.159 --> 01:57:58.390 align:start position:0%
i understand it the latest language that
um

01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
take it instead of
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
removing the section of on telepasses it
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
leaves it there with an additional
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
section that says if you have an
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
emergency license you could be
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
essentially promoted to a telepath mine
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
was a technical question
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
it is fully german
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
no question about that
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay working on fellows
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i just need a clarification here
 
01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:32.310 align:start position:0%
so i just need a clarification here
so

01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
what we voted on i'm not sure when it
 
01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.430 align:start position:0%
what we voted on i'm not sure when it
was

01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:37.030 align:start position:0%
was
um

01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it was the straw poll i think to to
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
be able to make the draft is we replaced
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
section 12
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
with something
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
related to emergency licenses
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
but now the suggestion is we want to
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
consider if we want to
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
do something different
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
keep the emergency but put the telepath
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:59:03.599 --> 01:59:06.550 align:start position:0%
back in
essentially

01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else questions comments
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay then the
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is to reconsider our
 
01:59:19.679 --> 01:59:20.790 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is to reconsider our
vote

01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
on section 12 where we adopted an
 
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:30.390 align:start position:0%
on section 12 where we adopted an
amendment

01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh verbs that they're psychic
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
i don't see any further discussion
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
so if you want to if you
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
would follow the rule on the question of
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
reopening that decision
 
01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:43.350 align:start position:0%
reopening that decision
okay

01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%

hard uh with regard to a number of
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
issues uh that required hard work and

excuse me improve this current section
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
by hearing from dr warner and the the
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
languages in front of the draft were
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
being worked on even as we speak so
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%

have voted yes
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%

approved fully
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
by the board and also incorporates the
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
input from the work session that was
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
chaired by representative yakubovic and
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
previously and also has the oplc
 
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.470 align:start position:0%
previously and also has the oplc
input

02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
input
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure in the latest
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
version which is advanced a little
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
further than the one that representative
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
schmidt was about to present last
 
02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
schmidt was about to present last
tuesday

02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.149 align:start position:0%
tuesday
uh

02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
this one has also a provision
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
to account for those directly
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
who have had emergency licenses
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
in psychology all this time
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
during the covid
 
02:05:45.119 --> 02:05:46.470 align:start position:0%
during the covid
pandemic

02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
and there are over a thousand of those
 
02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
and there are over a thousand of those
psychologists

02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
they as originally written this would
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
well for them but if we added the
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
section that they would automatically
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
immediately be given a
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
telepath license as soon as this
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
legislation passes
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that that will help them continue
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
the work that they're doing and have
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
continuity of care
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
with the many patients whom they've seen
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire during this time
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say there was one
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
question that had come up in several
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
discussions that i had with people
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that was what's the difference
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
between telemedicine and a full license
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
or basically those two types of practice
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
and they both must function under the
 
02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.470 align:start position:0%
and they both must function under the
law

02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
and i guess i have a good analogy for
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
you and that is that
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
riding a motorcycle follows the traffic
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
laws and so does driving a semi-tractor
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
trailer truck and yet we have different
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
licenses for them
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
all of the psychologists in new
 
02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire plus these emergency
 
02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:02.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire plus these emergency
psychologists

02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
have been doing telemedicine and we have
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
developed uh quite a bit of um
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
have new habits and also understanding
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
of how
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
the rules and our practices our habits
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
translate into this medium
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
there have been many many
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
trainings on this and the list serves
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
among psychologists
 
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.189 align:start position:0%
among psychologists
are

02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
full of discussion about this
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the psychologists who
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
have been granted entry uh to treat our
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
have likewise of course been involved in
 
02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.109 align:start position:0%
have likewise of course been involved in
this

02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
up gearing the tune-up that we're
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
getting to make sure that we have full
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
practice um
 
02:07:50.639 --> 02:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
practice um
adhesion

02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
adhesion
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
during our telemedicine sessions and
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
the attention that that has gotten is
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
very very good
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we do feel confident that this
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
psychologists who have been granted
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
will be able to function well with the
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
telepaths license
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
we are not um ready to grant full
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
licenses to everyone who has
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
been involved they would need to
 
02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.030 align:start position:0%
been involved they would need to
follow

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:25.750 align:start position:0%
follow
the

02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
board's rules in order to get a full
 
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
board's rules in order to get a full
license

02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a process new hampshire has
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
laws and rules in every one of the
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
boards to get a license
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh however in these discussions
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
we are also already looking at our emerg
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
our application
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
rules they are already
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
fully parsed apart and we're working on
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
that already
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
and in this discussion it's brought
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
forward that much more simplification is
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
desirable and so as we are working
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
through this process with jlcarr and uh
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
certainly with input
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
we are very very welcome to have input
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
from all of you of how you would like us
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
to proceed forward with our general
 
02:09:08.719 --> 02:09:09.830 align:start position:0%
to proceed forward with our general
license

02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
but we are very comfortable and
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
confident that we can accommodate the
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
emergency licensees
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
into practice in new hampshire and this
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
gives sort of a sheltered landing
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
for them into full-time
 
02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
for them into full-time
permanent

02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
practice and we're very comfortable with
 
02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:31.510 align:start position:0%
practice and we're very comfortable with
that

02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions you've all seen all
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
these materials that i've bombarded
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
everybody with so thank you
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
do we have questions
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes doctor
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
i apologize because i was working on two
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
other bills with my own committee so i
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
printed out
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
your proposed amendment but couldn't go
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
through it
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
in depth
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i think i see what may be a conflict
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
on i guess you would say page one
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh down under section two
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
d it says
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
in accordance with board rules and
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
payment of license
 
02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
payment of license
fees

02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then on the next page
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
the line under section 4c
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
any fees required to apply
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
is scratched out
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
so what exactly is the proposal for the
 
02:10:47.679 --> 02:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
so what exactly is the proposal for the
fees

02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
oh that's taken out i'm sorry because
 
02:10:55.109 --> 02:10:55.119 align:start position:0%
the board no longer sets their own fees
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's done in another section of live
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
believe it's
 
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
believe it's
i

02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
can't recall which section it is i'm
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
sorry but that's the one that has oplc
 
02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
um the office of professional license
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
they set the fee so it's not in our
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
statute anymore
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so the other question you
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
had was in was it roman three i just
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
pulled up the
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes are you looking at parentheses f as
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
it says um
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
parentheses c
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
parentheses c
 
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:45.270 align:start position:0%
parentheses c
okay

02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'll stop that must be coming out of
 
02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:48.390 align:start position:0%
i'll stop that must be coming out of
your

02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:11:50.550 --> 02:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
specific um
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
designated fees
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay so this is
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
roman three
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
licensees shall i agree to conditions
 
02:11:58.159 --> 02:11:59.350 align:start position:0%
licensees shall i agree to conditions
including

02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
and parentheses c
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
they need to recognize that even if
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
they're in another state that they must
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
surrender to our request
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
to comply and that would be sufficient
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
cause if we send them
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
an order to send information or reply to
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
us or to appear
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
for a discipline hearing and such or
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
any of the things that are required in
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
our discipline process that
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
in fact ignoring that is also cause for
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
revocation we really want because
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're out of state
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
agree to comply with the power
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
of the regulatory authority to have them
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
bring in information
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
i really do appreciate the opportunity
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
to bring this forward it's it's very
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
all right then the
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
this language looks clean enough to be
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
inserted into the not yet final
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
amendment for senate bill 133
 
02:13:35.119 --> 02:13:36.390 align:start position:0%
amendment for senate bill 133
so

02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
i believe the next thing to do
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
would be to vote on whether or not to do
 
02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:42.550 align:start position:0%
would be to vote on whether or not to do
so

02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
what used to be romans 12 but probably
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
isn't anymore
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
with this language as provided by
 
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:56.229 align:start position:0%
with this language as provided by
um

02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
question yes representative schmidt
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh well at this time it seems like a
 
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
uh well at this time it seems like a
motion

02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass would be appropriate
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh for our straw vote in any case
 
02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:18.310 align:start position:0%
uh for our straw vote in any case
right

02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's it okay so the motion is ought to
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
pass on this amendment to replace the
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
does do you wish to speak to your
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
amendment your motion representative
 
02:14:47.599 --> 02:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
amendment your motion representative
schmidt

02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
i believe this isn't uh still a further
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
improvement in the already
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
improved version that we voted on
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
previously so uh
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that we are making a
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
sincere effort to try to do the best
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
things we can for our citizens and for
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
our professions
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
that uh if we can if we can make it
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
better and this does that we should
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
support it so thank you
 
02:15:13.599 --> 02:15:15.589 align:start position:0%
support it so thank you
representative

02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
yes i will just say ditto to what he
 
02:15:17.599 --> 02:15:18.390 align:start position:0%
yes i will just say ditto to what he
said

02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it really does um
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
provide some opportunities for folks in
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
from sam blackis i'm still a little
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
fuzzy on this could someone in just a
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
few sentences give a summary of what
 
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
this change will do
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
it creates a new passive license
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
for out-of-state psychologists
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
to perform telehealth only
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
it gives the restrictions
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
that they need to
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
amendment versus what was already there
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
i forgot the difference between
 
02:16:02.079 --> 02:16:03.669 align:start position:0%
i forgot the difference between
the

02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
and this says that anyone who has an
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
emergency license gets a telepath
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
to practice remotely
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
the previous amendment deleted all
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
all reference to a telepath and simply
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
said that you had an emergency license
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
eliminating that first the full
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
when you said intermediate this
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
intermediate is
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
replacing their full licensure correct
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a limitation it's a
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
limitation on the licenses of people who
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
got emergency licenses
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
and but on the other hand
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
it does give them a
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
a life a license even if it's limited to
 
02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.190 align:start position:0%
a life a license even if it's limited to

uh one comment under roman five where it
 
02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh one comment under roman five where it
says

02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
people who have been granted emergency
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
licenses under the department of
 
02:20:36.319 --> 02:20:37.429 align:start position:0%
licenses under the department of
emergency

02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
shall be granted a telepath license i
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
think you will stay upon application to
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
they should have to take some action
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
to get the license
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
so yes i think it should be the board
 
02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:04.630 align:start position:0%
so yes i think it should be the board
okay

02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%

the non-german amendment and we seem to
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
be in fair agreement
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%

04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
separate from this amendment um
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
the stuff we agreed on earlier for 155
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
has to be merged together to
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
an official amendment
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we can't we can't exactly we're
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
still waiting for
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability corrections
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
well there is this uh there is the bill
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
about the total destruction of the
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
universe we might want to examine
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
what's that that's the way to do issues
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
that would have solved a lot of problems
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
leaving us to go carry a bag in the
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
clubs and uh head on out doing some
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
other work uh we'll let you go well i
 
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
got yard work this afternoon but yeah i
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
do have a tea time for 5 20 at december
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
do you have his cell number jeff
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes he does
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay i do as well and you do as well all
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
right i probably do too but i just
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible if you don't have
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
but you can't exactly parts of a bill
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
when you're at the final point it's you
 
04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
have to do the whole thing so that's
 
04:04:34.720 --> 04:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
have to do the whole thing so that's
great

04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh risk because rod penitent
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
was selling today for them this morning
 
04:04:41.600 --> 04:04:42.550 align:start position:0%
was selling today for them this morning
but

04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to cut them loose because
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
we might point out the typos to them
 
04:04:46.000 --> 04:04:47.189 align:start position:0%
we might point out the typos to them
also

04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:04:47.199 --> 04:04:49.429 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah this is definitely
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
this has titles in it so
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
what's the newest yep two of them
 
04:05:00.640 --> 04:05:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%

04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%

anybody
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
generally if
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you are the sponsor you don't even
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
sit at the table you usually sit
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%

it's an official household that seems to
happen

04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%

this committee has always
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
followed this rule
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
any bills where the sponsor is either at
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
a public hearing
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
does not sit at the table with the
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%

yeah just if he's readily available just
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
to ask if because it's an amendment
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%

04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%

quickly well make sure to mention that
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's a non-germane
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
amendment because that makes it really
 
04:16:13.030 --> 04:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%

04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%

04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
objection that's been raised i believe
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
is correct i don't think it's important
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
with whether whether you're sitting at
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
the table or not but uh i i don't
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
believe you should be chairing the
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
meeting under the circumstances however
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm completely comfortable with
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis or representative
 
04:17:38.720 --> 04:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis or representative
uh

04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:17:45.120 --> 04:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
um

it's facilitating the meetings what it's
 
04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
all about so i'm comfortable with
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative blechus taking over
 
04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
rather than wasting precious time uh
 
04:17:59.050 --> 04:17:59.060 align:start position:0%

04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
medicine or vaccine cannot be mandated

[Music]
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's interesting we're currently
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
conducting the largest experiment on
 
04:21:30.159 --> 04:21:31.349 align:start position:0%
conducting the largest experiment on
humanity

04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
with something that is only emergency
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
authorized these are not approved these
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
are not licensed and in the eua
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
approvals it clearly states that these
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
are not indicated uh for any condition
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually which is which is interesting
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
to read
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
um use of these excessively on a
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
population without long-term safety data
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
is technically a violation of the
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
nuremberg code
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the which we know what happened to
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
the doctors in germany after the
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
nuremberg trials
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
point i would like to bring up this is
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
technically by trying to mandate a
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's a public health hazard
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it decreases confidence when
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
something has to be mandated it
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
decreases the public's confidence in
 
04:22:19.199 --> 04:22:20.950 align:start position:0%
decreases the public's confidence in
that

04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
drug in that vaccine in that modality
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
this happened in the philippines several
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
years ago with the dengue vex
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
where a lot of children were injured and
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
after that the public confidence and
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination went from 88 down to in the
 
04:22:40.469 --> 04:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
high 20s low 30 percent
 
04:22:40.479 --> 04:22:41.349 align:start position:0%
high 20s low 30 percent
so

04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know it to to mandate something with
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
no long-term safety data is technically
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the vaccine those
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
who have wanted or needed the vaccine
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
that are in the high risk group have had
 
04:22:57.359 --> 04:22:58.309 align:start position:0%
that are in the high risk group have had
it

04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:22:58.319 --> 04:22:59.030 align:start position:0%
it
so

04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is to protect you from a
 
04:23:01.040 --> 04:23:02.149 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is to protect you from a
virus

04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
virus
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
and under you know the age of 65 this is
 
04:23:05.520 --> 04:23:06.269 align:start position:0%
and under you know the age of 65 this is
a

04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
99.99 survivable virus this becomes even
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
less than a flu
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
death rate if you look at the infection
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
fatality rate so we're looking at some
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
thing that obviously was scary at first
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
we used the precautionary principle but
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is something now that we know that
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
the the risk age for death from this
 
04:23:29.110 --> 04:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
virus and complications are age 65 and
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
older and those in that cohort of
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
individuals have had the opportunity to
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
receive this vaccine so far
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
now the one thing i think that we're
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
missing is if we look at the vaccine
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
adverse events reporting system
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
there are over 4 000 deaths associated
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
that are under investigation from the
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine itself that's more individuals
 
04:23:49.920 --> 04:23:51.670 align:start position:0%
vaccine itself that's more individuals
potentially

04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
dead from a vaccine than from 911 itself
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
there are over 100 point of order mr
 
04:23:56.560 --> 04:23:58.810 align:start position:0%
there are over 100 point of order mr

[Music]
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh the doctor is speaking about a
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
non-existent situation there is no
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
mandate under discussion
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
the bill of the non-german amendment is
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
a ban on vaccine passports and a ban on
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
mandate there are no mandates or vaccine
 
04:24:16.000 --> 04:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
mandate there are no mandates or vaccine
passports

04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
schmidt the testimony is jermaine
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to allow it thank you
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
please continue talking thank you mr

chair
um

04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:30.149 --> 04:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
so eight out of eight out of ten deaths
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
in north america have been in the
 
04:24:32.479 --> 04:24:33.750 align:start position:0%
in north america have been in the
high-risk

04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
high-risk
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
category so
 
04:24:37.990 --> 04:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
to to either mandate a vaccine or to
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
require a passport for something that is
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the younger age cohort more
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
survivable than
 
04:24:45.279 --> 04:24:46.550 align:start position:0%
survivable than
um

04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know an average flu season
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem medically
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
prudent in any way shape or form and
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
these vaccines additionally they didn't
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
submit to the fda their actual relative
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
risks their data points that are
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be submitted to the
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
government to approve vaccines they
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
submitted their relative risks and the
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
fda violated its own rule
 
04:25:10.479 --> 04:25:11.189 align:start position:0%
fda violated its own rule
in

04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
giving authorization to these the
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
absolute relative risk tells us that
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
120-ish people for the pfizer vaccine
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
would have to get both shots for one
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
person to have one less symptom
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
attributing to an experimental modality
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is technically at this point just
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
decreasing symptoms
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh and not providing you know
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
technically a full immunity as we've
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
seen ten or thousands of breakthrough
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
cases post-vaccine so
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
to require um
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
a vaccine or require a vaccine or a
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
passport or anything of that sort you
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
know this this is an experiment and
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
these these
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
have led to death hundreds of thousands
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
of adverse events and
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
we are pushing them forward as though
 
04:25:57.990 --> 04:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're an approved product they
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely are not
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing we're ignoring
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
is how many of us that have already in
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
our society had covid kovid provides the
 
04:26:05.520 --> 04:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
our society had covid kovid provides the
broadest

04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
broadest
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
most natural immunity of all studies out
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
of israel show that those who have had
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
covet have an equal if not better
 
04:26:12.560 --> 04:26:13.750 align:start position:0%
covet have an equal if not better
immunity

04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know to cover than you know the
 
04:26:17.279 --> 04:26:18.389 align:start position:0%
you know to cover than you know the
vaccine

04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing we're ignoring is how
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
many people actually have antibodies how
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
many people have a t cell response how
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
many people
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
if we look at the numbers within the
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
states your state as well
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
is very similar to my state presently
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
you know only a handful hundred two
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
hundred at most uh positive um cases per
 
04:26:41.110 --> 04:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
day were down at an endemic level and uh
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know were
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
close to getting back to functional if
 
04:26:47.670 --> 04:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
we actually look at the data
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
compared to the fears which we should be
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
overcoming by this point
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
um i know dr norcasm's here i
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
greatly admire and i hope he will talk
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
to the concept of screening before the
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine because we're putting a lot of
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
people at risk with vaccines
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
if we don't test to see if they have
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
cobit presently have had covet or have
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
antibodies ramping up so we're putting a
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
lot of our population at risk for
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
something that we
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
essentially as most of the nation have
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
gotten through already and we're getting
 
04:27:18.479 --> 04:27:19.349 align:start position:0%
gotten through already and we're getting
into

04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
a good uh level and health point and
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
we're ignoring critical public health
 
04:27:23.600 --> 04:27:24.710 align:start position:0%
we're ignoring critical public health
messages

04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%

04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to you know really

strong public health message
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
rather than you know have you had a shot
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
do you need a pass to have you had a
 
04:27:46.720 --> 04:27:48.469 align:start position:0%
do you need a pass to have you had a

04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
shot
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's that
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
children survive this at a hundred
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
percent rate statistically age 0 to 18.
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
our college-age students
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
140 000 patients in one study last year
 
04:27:59.920 --> 04:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
140 000 patients in one study last year
were

04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
out of 140 000 there were 17
 
04:28:03.439 --> 04:28:04.950 align:start position:0%
out of 140 000 there were 17
hospitalizations

04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
those had risk factors no deaths at that
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
point in a large study so we are looking
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
at this in an incorrect um medical
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
manner we've politicized something that
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
from a medical point of view we
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
understand very well now
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we know the risk groups they have
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
they are protected
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
we don't need to be pushing for
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
an experiment on humanity with unknown
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes and with the history of
 
04:28:31.040 --> 04:28:32.790 align:start position:0%
outcomes and with the history of
coronaviruses

04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
coronaviruses
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
prior to this we have never had a
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
coronavirus vaccine because we have
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
known that they lead to the hyperimmune
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
reactions down the road it's called an
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
antibody dependent enhancement reaction
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
we don't know if that's going to happen
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
with this one with my immunology
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
training there are five or six
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that can trigger this once
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
the virus becomes different enough and
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
we get exposed to it years from now
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
which could cause untold havoc if we
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
push too much vaccination
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.790 --> 04:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely okay absolutely
 
04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt would you like to
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
ask a question related to what you had
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
04:29:31.110 --> 04:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
to to to challenge the premise under
 
04:29:34.890 --> 04:29:34.900 align:start position:0%
which dr cole is testifying
 
04:29:34.900 --> 04:29:39.349 align:start position:0%
which dr cole is testifying
[Music]

04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm happy to do that
 
04:29:42.080 --> 04:29:43.910 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm happy to do that
okay

04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative schultz thank you
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i did hear your
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
point about wanting to keep the q a
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
parts brief i will have that goal
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
through this whole game
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh feel free to call me out of order
 
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's kind of fun okay
 
04:30:00.309 --> 04:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you dr cole
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
are you aware that
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
the very well respected factcheck.org
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
run by the annenberg
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
center which is a nonpartisan
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
journalism school
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
has actually fact checked a speech you
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
gave with all the same or similar points
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh at the in idaho at the um invitation
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
of the lieutenant governor i believe
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
they fact checked all the things that
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying and in fact determine that
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
to be woefully
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
um untrue are you aware of the annenberg
 
04:30:34.720 --> 04:30:41.189 align:start position:0%
um untrue are you aware of the annenberg
factcheck.org

04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
we seem to be accusing the uh witness of
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh spreading misinformation
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps even willfully
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that that is very germane in
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
this situation because
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
a respected independent fact check group
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
has determined his views
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to allow the uh
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
the question just um
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
only because it seems to me you're
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
trying to solicit whether or not the
 
04:31:11.670 --> 04:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
good doctor is aware of a counter study
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
just be careful about challenging his
 
04:31:15.359 --> 04:31:16.389 align:start position:0%
just be careful about challenging his
intent

04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
intent
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you i will
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
i'm quite a uh thank you representative
 
04:31:22.469 --> 04:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
schultz yes i'm quite aware of that
 
04:31:22.479 --> 04:31:23.990 align:start position:0%
schultz yes i'm quite aware of that
factcheck.org

04:31:23.990 --> 04:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
factcheck.org
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
i spoke spoke with a reporter i gave her
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
all my articles and counterpoints she
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
did not publish all the articles and
 
04:31:32.469 --> 04:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
counterpoints i had my medical evidence
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
that i did present to her they do have
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
their bias most certainly as well as
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
they're funded by
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
the vaccine industry so fact checking
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
the fact checkers yes they have funding
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine industry so there's
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
their fact check is with not without
 
04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
bias itself and as i said i'm not
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
affiliated with any party i'm not
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
affiliated with any political
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
organization and i did respond to them
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
and i wish that they would have actually
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
put the medical data with which i
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
responded which would have been the
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
ethical the proper
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the kind thing to do i'm i'm willing
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
to be uh challenged on any point i bring
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
up i have the science behind what i
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
state i have no ulterior motive other
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
than the wellness and the health of our
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
society your state my state and our
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
great nation thank you
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair just one quick follow-up
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
the one i'm citing is the annenberg um
 
04:32:25.600 --> 04:32:27.030 align:start position:0%
the one i'm citing is the annenberg um
organization

04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
are you saying that they're funded by um
 
04:32:30.880 --> 04:32:32.710 align:start position:0%
are you saying that they're funded by um
vaccine

04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
pharma type organizations because my
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
impression of black group is it's
 
04:32:37.279 --> 04:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
impression of black group is it's
independent

04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
of any influence
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
not true actually part of their funding
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
comes from the robert wood johnson
 
04:32:44.960 --> 04:32:46.070 align:start position:0%

04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative and they get a good
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of their funding from that
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
group so they're not without ties
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh representatives
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would like to ask
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
that um you limit
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
the speakers to three minutes of
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and then give us time for
 
04:33:12.000 --> 04:33:13.029 align:start position:0%
testimony and then give us time for
questions

04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
and also for all those out there waiting
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
to speak i would hope that they speak
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
specifically to this bill i don't think
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
we need a lesson about um viruses or
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the coba virus or any virus in general i
 
04:33:29.189 --> 04:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
think that they should be speaking
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
directly to
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
the benefits or the um
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
detrimental effects of this bill
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
i would say that it's pretty much
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
impossible to not talk about the
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
virus that causes the need for a vaccine
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
but your point is well taken and i'm
 
04:33:48.869 --> 04:33:48.879 align:start position:0%
trying to keep an eye on the time limits
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that the doctor didn't take
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
more than three minutes um oh i'm quite
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
sure he did
 
04:33:54.320 --> 04:33:55.349 align:start position:0%
sure he did
well

04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
we'll agree to disagree uh do you have a
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
no that was what i wanted to say all
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you for taking the time to
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
testify doctor
 
04:34:13.349 --> 04:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
mr norcasm
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%

specifically in your state so i
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%

04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
and i've served on the faculty of
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
medical schools at penn harvard and
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
thomas jefferson university in
 
04:35:14.799 --> 04:35:16.390 align:start position:0%
thomas jefferson university in
philadelphia

04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
philadelphia
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
and i want to start by stating that
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
i am a very very strong supporter of
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
this vaccine i believe this vaccine
 
04:35:23.039 --> 04:35:24.390 align:start position:0%
this vaccine i believe this vaccine
technology

04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:35:26.709 --> 04:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
is uh one of the most remarkable
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
achievements of immunological science
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
in the recent past
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
i do believe that it is my personal
 
04:35:33.279 --> 04:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
i do believe that it is my personal
opinion

04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:35:34.400 --> 04:35:35.189 align:start position:0%
opinion
that

04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
we ought to be offering this vaccine
 
04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
to as many uh non-immune americans as is
 
04:35:43.029 --> 04:35:43.039 align:start position:0%
possible as quickly as possible so we
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
can get a handle on this pandemic
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
so without a question as an immunologist
 
04:35:48.390 --> 04:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
that is my opinion about the vaccine and
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
about its efficacy
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
of course i have stated some concerns
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
about safety and that's available in the
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
public press and i invite you to
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
listen to those interviews and opinions
 
04:36:02.070 --> 04:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
that i've stated
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to make three points
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
specifically vis-a-vis this this bill uh
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
specifically focused on the idea of
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccination
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh the first point that i'd like to
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention for
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
consideration is that
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
um i you know i don't believe it's a
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
tenable position for a state
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
to allow private corporations businesses
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
and academic institutions to force or
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
coerce in any way citizens into
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
undergoing any kind of medical treatment
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
at risk to their civil liberties or
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
i i know that this would be a violation
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
core medical principle of autonomy and
 
04:36:39.990 --> 04:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
very certainly i believe
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
that that the legal experts will will
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
inform you that it also will likely be a
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
breach of the united states constitution
 
04:36:46.480 --> 04:36:47.429 align:start position:0%
breach of the united states constitution
herself

04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
herself
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the second point is uh something that dr
 
04:36:49.680 --> 04:36:50.629 align:start position:0%
the second point is uh something that dr
cole

04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
cole
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
alluded to and this is something that
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
i've been advocating with the cdc
 
04:36:56.470 --> 04:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
for quite some time and with the fda
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
which is that at present about 20 30
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
percent of our fellow americans are
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
already naturally immune and from an
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
immunological perspective
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
including the emerging data from israel
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
as well as prior studies these already
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
infected people um actually have a quite
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
substantial amounts of protective
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
antibodies the same kind of antibodies
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
that the vaccine induces in them and so
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
they are they stand to gain marginally
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
or uh not at all and therefore this uh
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
medical procedure in them would be an
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary one because these folks will
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
already be immune and that's about one
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
out of four americans right so i will
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
state to this committee with 100
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
certainty that mandating such
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or marginally beneficial
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
medical treatments
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
in a one-size-fits-all fashion as we're
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
doing as the cdc is promoting is really
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
the recipe for causing irreparable
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
medical harm in some unsuspecting
 
04:37:48.629 --> 04:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
citizens of your state and across the
 
04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
country so i would really urge you to
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
think about that concept very very
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
carefully the third point is these
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates i believe will be an
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
absolute disaster for civil rights and
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
equity and inclusion things that we
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
should all care about you have to
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
recognize that the same socio-economic
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
demographics in our nation who suffer
 
04:38:08.551 --> 04:38:08.561 align:start position:0%
disproportionately from a lack of access
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
to everything from health care to
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
adequate voting rights will be made to
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
suffer more using any sort of cumbersome
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate these vaccine mandates
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
are not going to be trivial to uh
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
introduce to people with disparities and
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic despair disparities so in
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
summary what i'd like to
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
clarify in this record for you is my
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to vaccine mandates
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
not to the vaccine itself this vaccine
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be deployed efficiently into
 
04:38:38.629 --> 04:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
people who need it myself i have i've
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated my teenage children have
 
04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated my elderly parents have
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated i believe in this
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine and i know the technology that
 
04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's based on but i think these mandates
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
will be a disaster and that they'll
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
promote irreparable medical harm and
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
inequities to minority subsets of
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting citizens around the country
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
and some of them some of these folks
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
will be some of the weakest amongst us
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i strongly urge you to support sb155
 
04:39:03.920 --> 04:39:04.869 align:start position:0%
so i strongly urge you to support sb155
um

04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
in in um
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to these mandates and to uh
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
consider very carefully that the
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
solution to um these these ideas of
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitancy is actually to respect
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
individual choices respect individual
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
americans and to respect the science the
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
truth and healing in our nation is going
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
to come in the center not in in a
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
polarized discourse as i see it right
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
now there's tremendous polarization on
 
04:39:34.230 --> 04:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
this idea some people believe this this
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine does not work that it's that
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's some sort of mind control device
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
that bill gates has designed right and
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
some people some people uh believe that
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
we should just give put it into anyone
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know i i have never heard of a
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
medical treatment ever
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
that is uh devoid of some some rate of
 
04:39:52.230 --> 04:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
complication and to assume that this
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
particular medical therapy is going to
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
have no complications associated is a
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
mistake to assume that we can give it to
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
people who don't need it and not expect
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
harm is unreasonable it is a violation
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
of medical ethical principles to give
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
people who are already immune
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
a therapy that they do not stand to
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
benefit from and the data on that is
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
unassailable both from a scientific
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
prognostication perspective as well as
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
from the clinical trials emerging from
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
places like israel and the united
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
kingdom so i would urge you to encourage
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
the cdc and the public health
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
departments to really
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
not mandate this to aim for education
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
public education as well as to really
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
ask the cdc whether already immune
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
people need this vaccine
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor will you entertain
 
04:40:39.120 --> 04:40:44.070 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor will you entertain
questions

04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
talk to me and say questions
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
of course yes
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for taking my question
 
04:41:00.150 --> 04:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh one of your statements that you had
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
made was that
 
04:41:02.080 --> 04:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
made was that
uh

04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
businesses forcing vaccines on their
 
04:41:06.000 --> 04:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
businesses forcing vaccines on their
workers

04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:41:11.110 --> 04:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh could be unconstitutional
 
04:41:13.750 --> 04:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
um could you explain to me how that
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
would happen when currently schools uh
 
04:41:19.030 --> 04:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
k-12 are allowed to require vaccinations
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
for students um and to my knowledge that
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
has not been found unconstitutional that
 
04:41:23.840 --> 04:41:24.708 align:start position:0%
has not been found unconstitutional that
why

04:41:24.708 --> 04:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
a business or a pub college would be
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
found unconstitutional for sure uh mr
 
04:41:30.628 --> 04:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
goldie i'm not an i'm not an attorney
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
and i if you if you noted i um um i um
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
qualified that by saying almost
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly i reached the united states
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
constitution i think anytime you use
 
04:41:39.520 --> 04:41:40.550 align:start position:0%
constitution i think anytime you use
coercion

04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
you know anytime you sort of use a
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism where where
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
which is designed to curtail
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
the uh capacity of a citizen to engage
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
in employment or educational
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities yeah you have to wonder
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
whether that action actually stands in
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
the face of the united states
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
constitution so in other words if we if
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
we are going to put into place
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that would curtail the
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity of of individual citizens to
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
um to employment to the basically the
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
pursuit of life um
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
and life uh and and liberty i i i think
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
you have to question whether that goes
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
against the grain of our constitution uh
 
04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps it goes against the grain of our
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
ethos uh it certainly should so i think
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
that you know right now we're dealing
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
with a with a very uncertain situation a
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
lot of people are operating based on
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
fear and i think a lot of those fears
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
are are irrational and unreasonable i
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't think we can disrespect that i i
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
think we if
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
we disrespect this concept that there
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
are many folks about 50 of the country
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
who either have doubts about this
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine or are hesitant i think this is
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to backfire so my my suggestion to
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
you respectfully is that um you know if
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
the lawyers tell you that it's not
 
04:42:49.120 --> 04:42:50.470 align:start position:0%
the lawyers tell you that it's not
unconstitutional

04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
i would say that it goes against the
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
american ethos and it goes against the
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
basic fundamental you know principles of
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
human decency to to threaten someone by
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
with this concept that they can't get
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
educated or they can't or they can't you
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
know make a living or they can't have a
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
job because they're not going to get a
 
04:43:05.120 --> 04:43:06.470 align:start position:0%
job because they're not going to get a
vaccine

04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't think this is right i i think
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to we're going to
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
make a very big mistake i mean it's
 
04:43:12.868 --> 04:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
going to turn into a draconian thing
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
where about 50 of the country half of
 
04:43:17.190 --> 04:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
our politics is basically shoving some
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
something down people's throats where
 
04:43:20.470 --> 04:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
where they just don't want it and and
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
really good that's the against the grain
 
04:43:25.510 --> 04:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
of being american frankly thank you okay
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:43:26.798 --> 04:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
follow up
yes

04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that you believe it
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
should be fun
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but it isn't
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as of what we know
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not a i'm not an attorney uh i'm
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
just suggesting that maybe because
 
04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
certainly it's a violation of medical
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
ethics to force anyone to do anything
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
including getting vaccinated
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative schultz
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'd love to keep talking about that but
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
i want to ask you a separate question
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
related to what you've said because it's
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
interesting that you say you actually
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
support the
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
you like this vaccine you've gotten this
 
04:44:05.190 --> 04:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's not that it's not that i
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
like it representative it's that i know
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
the immunology behind it when i was in
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
graduate school it was being developed i
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
know the technology it works very well
 
04:44:14.070 --> 04:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know you can't you can't you
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
can't argue no one can argue against you
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
know neutralizing igg antibodies and
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
prime t cells these antibodies are going
 
04:44:23.110 --> 04:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
to be protected and isn't this our um rm
 
04:44:23.120 --> 04:44:24.628 align:start position:0%
to be protected and isn't this our um rm
mrna

04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%

04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine technology it is actually not
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
new haven't we been researching this
 
04:44:29.040 --> 04:44:29.910 align:start position:0%
new haven't we been researching this
since

04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
maybe the late 90s yes
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
20 plus years this technology is about
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
30 years old it's been in the pipelines
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
of academia and industry this is not a
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
new technology however that doesn't
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
override the fact that the vast majority
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the public aren't familiar with it
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
like for example you can you remember
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
when the cell phones first came out
 
04:44:47.590 --> 04:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
right people thought they were going to
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
walk around with brain cancer right i
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
mean the technology for cell phones was
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
in the pipelines of the department of
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
defense and academia for two decades
 
04:44:56.310 --> 04:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
before the marketplace saw it so i think
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the fears of this vaccine are
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
irrational at the same time at the same
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
time we got to be very careful about
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
mandating anything because you know you
 
04:45:08.470 --> 04:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
know our our democracy is you know
 
04:45:09.990 --> 04:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're not a theocracy we're not we're
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
not a totalitarian system we have to
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
respect people's individual um
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
understanding and meet them where they
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
are so this vaccine mandate is going to
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
be an absolute disaster from that
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
perspective i appreciate you answering
 
04:45:23.180 --> 04:45:23.190 align:start position:0%
my question my pleasure representative
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:25.110 align:start position:0%
my question my pleasure representative
[Music]

04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
um yes doctor if
 
04:45:29.600 --> 04:45:30.550 align:start position:0%
um yes doctor if
um

04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
if i understood you correctly you said
 
04:45:32.480 --> 04:45:33.350 align:start position:0%
if i understood you correctly you said
that

04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 to 30 percent of
 
04:45:35.840 --> 04:45:37.190 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 to 30 percent of
americans

04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
americans
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
have a natural immunity
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
is there a simple
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
inexpensive efficient way
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
to test that
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative for asking
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
this so first of all the data that i'm
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
quoting comes from the from the red
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
cross the red cross recently published a
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
study that that demonstrated that
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 20 this is several
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
months ago so about 20 of americans were
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
donating blood actually uh were uh
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
positive for antibodies and those are
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
the folks who are immune those are the
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
people who are donating convalescent
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
plasma and incidentally we are mandating
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
those folks to get vaccinated too in
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
some places right so we're actually
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
taking their plasma to use to treat
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
people who are infected but at the same
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
time we're required to get vaccinated so
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't jive but but you know i have
 
04:46:25.510 --> 04:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
to say that the 20 number comes from
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
there and yes in fact the antibody tests
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
are quite uh vastly available every
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
corner lab core um across the country
 
04:46:33.990 --> 04:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
and what i've been advocating is this
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
concept of screen before vaccine and
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
i've been in direct communication with
 
04:46:39.430 --> 04:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
dr janet woodcock
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
at the fda about this that this idea
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
that we can actually if we can put a
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
rover on mars we can certainly get
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
americans especially high-risk americans
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
just get screened before vaccination and
 
04:46:53.110 --> 04:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
only deliver this vaccine when it's
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
medically necessary you know and i have
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
no objection to getting this vaccine
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
into younger kids but as i said my
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
teenagers have gotten it my younger kids
 
04:47:02.310 --> 04:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
will probably get it when it becomes
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
available but you know i think this idea
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
of putting this vaccine into people who
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't need it is absurd it's completely
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
absurd it's it's a dramatic error in in
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory policy at the level of the
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
fda and the cdc and we should all fight
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
it both parties this is this is going to
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
hurt people
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh follow up question
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is a question i have curiosity for
 
04:47:27.840 --> 04:47:28.948 align:start position:0%
this is a question i have curiosity for
mr

04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
norsham and for mr cole
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
you had signed in on the
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
sheet to testify
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
and you showed your title as an elected
 
04:47:40.240 --> 04:47:41.350 align:start position:0%
and you showed your title as an elected
official

04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
official
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
did you perhaps choose the wrong
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
category or what office are you elected
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
to oh i i apologize i i don't know i uh
 
04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
a representative uh lawsec
 
04:47:53.910 --> 04:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
from the state of
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
invited me to this i never signed up on
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
anything some that must be an error i'm
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
not an elected official i'm a physician
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
and an enologist and a public health
 
04:48:05.430 --> 04:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
advocate in philadelphia
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
all right and is that true of uh mr cole
 
04:48:09.280 --> 04:48:11.030 align:start position:0%
all right and is that true of uh mr cole
also

04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
we know
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
he's no longer here so
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this will be quick um
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know the the antibody test um that
 
04:48:23.680 --> 04:48:24.550 align:start position:0%
you know the the antibody test um that
you

04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
are mentioning the concern i have
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
because i don't think you are in new
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire you know certainly we're very
 
04:48:32.550 --> 04:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible here as i'm sure
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:48:36.628 --> 04:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
isn't that an expensive process
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it uh comparing the safety and
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be actually more
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable to just you know
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinate everybody but the isn't that
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
antibody test
 
04:48:55.990 --> 04:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
expensive um so so um representative
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
schultz you know i think that um the the
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
idea here is that that we have to decide
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
whether does every american life matter
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
or not number one and number two whether
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
we agree with the idea of medical
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
necessity so in other words are we going
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do things to people who need them or
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
stand to benefit from them or not right
 
04:49:14.948 --> 04:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
and if the answer to both those
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
questions is yes every single american
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
matters and b
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes we're not going to do anything
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's unnecessary or marginally
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
beneficial to people then the question
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
becomes how do we implement it so people
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
can have access look we built millions
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
of respirators at the on the front end
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
of this thing we activated the defense
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
production act right the reality is that
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
this thing this antibody test is already
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the supply chain around the country
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
almost every american has insurance
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
access many americans itself pay for
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
this i mean you know in most
 
04:49:44.470 --> 04:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas and even in most
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
rural areas there are lab wars within a
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
10-mile radius of everyone now if
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
president biden and and the democrats in
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
the white house and again this is not a
 
04:49:52.948 --> 04:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
partisan thing i think we should all
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
come together on this right
 
04:49:57.190 --> 04:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
if if there's willingness and capacity
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
to activate at a federal level then
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes and we can risk stratify
 
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
who needs it and who doesn't so for
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
example if you're in an institution if
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
you're like in a geriatrics institution
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know you're at high risk of having
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
the vaccine but if you're a suburban
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
soccer mom right you may be at low risk
 
04:50:14.550 --> 04:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
you may just need to have a choice but
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know if you remember the military
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
service if you're if you're in a
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
congested area say in north philly right
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
where you're actually at high risk you
 
04:50:24.550 --> 04:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
know to not screen folks and and exclude
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
people who are already immune is a
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
massive error the other dimension of
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
this representative schultz i wanted to
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
mention is that you know
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine to americans is one
 
04:50:36.550 --> 04:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
thing right but the reality is that
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
places like brazil and and india are the
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
breeding ground for new variants right
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
we should really focus some of our
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
activity and actions to delivering this
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine to the rest of the world now one
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
one pathway is to use intellectual
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
property to relax intellectual property
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
rights the other is to say hey wait a
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
minute we have like
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know an additional 100 or 200
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
million vaccine shots in america who
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
aren't necessary which aren't necessary
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
for people are already immune why don't
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
we share these with our partners and
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
allies right why don't we get out of our
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
own bubble right and actually look at
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
the global picture and say hey wait a
 
04:51:09.670 --> 04:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
minute look people are in india like dr
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
are dropping like flies why are vaccines
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
to americans who don't need it and again
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
i would suggest you that this is not a
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
partisan issue i know i'm here on behalf
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the republican side and advocating
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill but really unless we can
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
find the center unless we can somehow
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
have you know uh get out of this sort of
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach which is
 
04:51:31.590 --> 04:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
where harm lives and i want to also
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate to the committee an example
 
04:51:34.708 --> 04:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to take too much time
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
but look i'm going to have to go ahead
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
and cut you off here um we're running
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
really low on
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem you know the example i
 
04:51:43.110 --> 04:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to use was how medicine has
 
04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
become increasingly personalized mr
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and you know to to give up that
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
idea of personalization of medicine is a
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
mistake that's where harm is going you
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
know i lost my own wife to that exact
 
04:51:55.350 --> 04:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
catastrophe there was a medical
 
04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
procedure that was being applied to
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
women in a one-size-fits-all fashion
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
when we do that in medicine we end up
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
killing people unjustifiably we can't do
 
04:52:04.958 --> 04:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
killing people unjustifiably we can't do
that

04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:52:09.040 --> 04:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
okay

04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
next up i'm going to call
 
04:52:14.480 --> 04:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
next up i'm going to call
dr

04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:17.040 --> 04:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
lawson

04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
lawson
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
hello thank you chair um
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
i would say that uh my i don't have any
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
disclosures or anything like that can
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay
 
04:52:27.040 --> 04:52:28.628 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay
yes

04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay um i don't have any disclosures or
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
anything of the sort i'm a pediatrician
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
i'm at dartmouth hitchcock um who wanted
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
to speak today um and i'd say largely i
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
do agree with dr um north chasm that uh
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think that any one thing is
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
applicable to everything um that being
 
04:52:46.160 --> 04:52:46.948 align:start position:0%
applicable to everything um that being
said

04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
um i have been doing some recent
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
research funded by the state of new
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire so thank you for that on
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
pediatric causes um
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
or cancer causes for the pediatric
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
population and risk factors associated
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
with it i'm in doing some of that
 
04:53:03.510 --> 04:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
article research and review
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we have found that is not
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
like positive so much as preventative
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
and that is vaccines as a whole in
 
04:53:10.798 --> 04:53:12.070 align:start position:0%
and that is vaccines as a whole in
general

04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:53:15.750 --> 04:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
just kind of that being said
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines overall that have been approved
 
04:53:18.080 --> 04:53:19.510 align:start position:0%
vaccines overall that have been approved
and

04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
fda kind of screened have generally been
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
overall and that are here in the united
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
states have been improvements for
 
04:53:28.390 --> 04:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
children's health um
 
04:53:30.550 --> 04:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
and in the past when we've had
 
04:53:33.990 --> 04:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
incidences of decreased stringency with
 
04:53:34.000 --> 04:53:35.430 align:start position:0%
incidences of decreased stringency with
vaccines

04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
04:53:36.788 --> 04:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
in certain states
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
like texas california florida even here
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we've had increase in
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
health concerns and health costs such as
 
04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
with measles outbreaks and whooping
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
cough or pertussis outbreaks
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's something to kind
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
of keep in mind um and my kind of whole
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
purpose and
 
04:53:56.550 --> 04:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
intent behind you know
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
discussing this is ultimately i'm
 
04:53:59.910 --> 04:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
pediatrician i know no offense to the
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
adults but i care about kids
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
and we as adults can help take care of
 
04:54:04.798 --> 04:54:05.750 align:start position:0%
and we as adults can help take care of
kids

04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:54:08.550 --> 04:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
by getting vaccinated um
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
one big kind of uh take-home point that
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
i have to describe that
 
04:54:16.550 --> 04:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
and how vaccines are helpful for the
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
sickest to kids um is that here at
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
dartmouth we had a patient who's you
 
04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
know had leukemia um getting treated on
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
chemo had no immune system because he
 
04:54:27.670 --> 04:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
had just finished his last dose of chemo
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
everything was finished and he was going
 
04:54:29.200 --> 04:54:30.390 align:start position:0%
everything was finished and he was going
home

04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
but then ended up getting an infection
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
from a vaccine preventable disease
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
and eventually overtook his body and he
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
succumbed to the age of four
 
04:54:42.070 --> 04:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
secondary to a disease that could be
 
04:54:43.270 --> 04:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
prevented by
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know getting vaccines
 
04:54:47.110 --> 04:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
and so ultimately uh i agree with dr
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
north chasm is that you know people have
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
the right to decide but i also think
 
04:54:51.440 --> 04:54:52.310 align:start position:0%
the right to decide but i also think
that

04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:54.788 --> 04:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
we as a public have the right to take
 
04:54:57.030 --> 04:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
care of and you know
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
should be taking care of
 
04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
those who can't take care of themselves
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
like children um
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so you know taking care of those you
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
know little four-year-olds who can't
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
have an immune response and by
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know encouraging others to get the
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine is highly uh beneficial to that
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
population in addition to
 
04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
those that whether it be cancer or chemo
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
we just don't have a great immune
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um we take questions
 
04:55:28.230 --> 04:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'm representative schultz
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you dr
 
04:55:32.150 --> 04:55:32.160 align:start position:0%

[Music]
um

04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:35.830 --> 04:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
for the kids
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh it is
 
04:55:41.910 --> 04:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
concerns some folks
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
is the fact that schools mandate certain
 
04:55:49.910 --> 04:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that's
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the university system which i
 
04:55:51.920 --> 04:55:52.708 align:start position:0%
certainly the university system which i
guess

04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
those folks technically most of them are
 
04:55:56.230 --> 04:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
not children but
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh similarly some of our public
 
04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
universities are requiring
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
for students to return to in-person
 
04:56:06.240 --> 04:56:07.430 align:start position:0%
for students to return to in-person
learning

04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
learning
 
04:56:07.440 --> 04:56:08.550 align:start position:0%
learning
um

04:56:08.550 --> 04:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
do you
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
04:56:13.510 --> 04:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
causes a problem
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
or does this
 
04:56:18.150 --> 04:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
constitute having this mandate for kids
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
in schools or young adults in the
 
04:56:20.718 --> 04:56:22.550 align:start position:0%
in schools or young adults in the
university

04:56:22.550 --> 04:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
university
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
post-secondary schooling
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
causes any difficulty or problem
 
04:56:32.070 --> 04:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of difference in
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
the like kind of two parts of that
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
question in that um
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
yeah there are mandatory vaccines
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
required for you know public school
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
universities and um you know public
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
education system but i think that's
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
that's just what it is is the public
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
education system and so that's you know
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
the public the state um wherever it is
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
saying that these
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines are required to maintain a
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
general um healthy public as deemed by
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
you know government the state
 
04:57:06.150 --> 04:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
um and if you don't want your child to
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to get
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
um certain vaccines but they're required
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
at you know public schools then there
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
are private institutions that you know
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
are more welcome and opening to that um
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
they just understand that by opening
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
that they're increasing the potential
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
and risk for infections in their
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
population now that in the setting of
 
04:57:26.470 --> 04:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
covet vaccine so uh i would agree with
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
the previous um two speakers that the
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh covet vaccine is largely not as
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial for younger patients and that
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
so much other people around them being
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated is more beneficial because
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
while they're
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
not true
 
04:57:44.310 --> 04:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have had patients
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
pass away um with kovid
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:57:50.550 --> 04:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily it is definitely not as
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
common as an older population however
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
the most important point being that with
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
kovid you know we're looking at the
 
04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
whole picture not just individual you
 
04:58:03.270 --> 04:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
know young patients versus old patients
 
04:58:04.948 --> 04:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
and so i think that with that if you
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:58:07.830 --> 04:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
younger patient who needs a vaccine to
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
go to school
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not as concerned for that as opposed
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
to the people who they're going to share
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
the infection with if that makes sense
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
young young
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
adult and adolescent population have
 
04:58:23.670 --> 04:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
been shown to be the most kind of uh
 
04:58:26.230 --> 04:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
carriers um so to speak of the vaccine
 
04:58:28.230 --> 04:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
and so when they go home to their you
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
know elderly families and things like
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
that they're the ones that are most
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
likely going to suffer from it and so as
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
far as
 
04:58:36.788 --> 04:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
the age gap and
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations i think that we still
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
have we're still getting a lot of
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
information i know that dr cole said
 
04:58:43.990 --> 04:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
that you know we know this you know we
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
know a lot about this now and we
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
definitely know more about it now than
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
we did but we definitely don't know a
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
lot about it there's still a lot of
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
things we need to learn about the
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine and not just that not another
 
04:58:57.030 --> 04:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine the virus but in addition to
 
04:58:57.040 --> 04:58:58.310 align:start position:0%
vaccine the virus but in addition to
that

04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:00.788 --> 04:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
how it's affecting people um and not
 
04:59:00.798 --> 04:59:01.670 align:start position:0%
how it's affecting people um and not
just

04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
in certain kind of isolated situations
 
04:59:03.680 --> 04:59:04.788 align:start position:0%
in certain kind of isolated situations
there's

04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars spent on research
 
04:59:10.948 --> 04:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
for individual things one at a time and
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have you know a section of
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
information on this for the last year
 
04:59:14.948 --> 04:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
but that's you know pretty minuscule
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
comparative to other diseases and
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
processes that we've studied so i think
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of learning to do on that
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
i hope that answered your question
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much
 
04:59:28.948 --> 04:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question actually
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
04:59:31.440 --> 04:59:32.628 align:start position:0%
about the bill
so

04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
doctor do you think that it's
 
04:59:34.000 --> 04:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
doctor do you think that it's
appropriate

04:59:35.270 --> 04:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:59:35.280 --> 04:59:37.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate
or

04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:59:39.910 --> 04:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
or even reasonable for the a person or
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
the government to ask
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
another person or to discriminate
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
against those individuals based on their
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine status or immunity status when
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to matters of public
 
04:59:51.120 --> 04:59:54.070 align:start position:0%
it comes to matters of public
accommodation

04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.550 --> 04:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
um i think that depends
 
04:59:58.948 --> 04:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
so i i would agree with
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
norchasm in that you you can't you
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
globally group people together
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so if you say no we're not going to
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know provide services to any one
 
05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
person because they don't have an immune
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
status i think that that's wrong because
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
certain like like you said certain
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
people don't need it because they're
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
they're you know got it already and we
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
could be using those resources elsewhere
 
05:00:20.080 --> 05:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
could be using those resources elsewhere
or

05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
you're at the risk of sharing that
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
infection with other people
 
05:00:24.958 --> 05:00:25.750 align:start position:0%
infection with other people
so

05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
to answer your question no i don't think
 
05:00:29.110 --> 05:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
that it should be and i think that any
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
one kind of direction or the other is
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
trying to make it like a more partisan
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
and i agree it needs to be more centered
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.270 --> 05:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
they're seeing none thank you for your
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
time doctor
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman could could dr daley um
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
speak next
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh can you promote him
 
05:00:57.840 --> 05:01:06.868 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh can you promote him
or

05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:17.830 --> 05:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
great well good afternoon everyone thank
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak today i'm
 
05:01:21.030 --> 05:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
beth daly i'm the bureau chief for
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
infectious disease control here
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire dhhs and i'm here to
 
05:01:27.510 --> 05:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
provide testimony in opposition to this
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment first i just quickly wanted to
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
address cover 19 vaccines specifically
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
to remind you all that there are no
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
legal requirements for coven 19 vaccine
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and you've heard some
 
05:01:41.110 --> 05:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
testimony from people promoting
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
pseudoscience what sounds like science
 
05:01:45.270 --> 05:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
but it does not represent real science
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't want you all to forget that
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are still over 300 people that are
 
05:01:51.190 --> 05:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
dying in the united states each day from
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
cove at 19. and this number was over 3
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
000 each day
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
if you could refrain from characterizing
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony of previous witnesses
 
05:02:03.750 --> 05:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
as pseudoscience just stick to what you
 
05:02:03.760 --> 05:02:04.708 align:start position:0%
as pseudoscience just stick to what you
know

05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
the number of deaths was over 3 000 each
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
day prior to the availability of vaccine
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
and among these deaths have been around
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
500 children who have died from covet
 
05:02:13.520 --> 05:02:14.708 align:start position:0%
500 children who have died from covet
19.

05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
19.
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
it's not true that thousands of people
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
have not died from the vaccine so i do
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
think it's within my realm of my
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
testimony to tell you when things are
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
not true it's not true and it's
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous to imply or say otherwise
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go broader than covet 19
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine though because we're quite
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
concerned that these amendments are
 
05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
reaching beyond covet 19 we're very
 
05:02:37.110 --> 05:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about any restrictions on
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
existing vaccination requirements such
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
as those that are in place for schools
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
and certain types of healthcare
 
05:02:42.638 --> 05:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
and certain types of healthcare
employment

05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
because vaccine coverage is not 100 nor
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
are vaccines 100 effective vaccine
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
requirements are essential to the health
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and safety of our communities letting
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
children attend school without regard to
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination status will set us back over
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
100 years before we had safe and
 
05:03:02.868 --> 05:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
effective vaccines when millions of
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
children were infected and disabled by
 
05:03:06.868 --> 05:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine preventable diseases and
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
thousands died each and every year we
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to protect our
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
citizens and this amendment is dangerous
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't think our state wants to
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
take these steps backwards
 
05:03:18.788 --> 05:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
we also have concerns regarding the
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on documenting vaccination
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
status documenting vaccination status is
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
an important obligation for schools
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
employers and public health this
 
05:03:29.830 --> 05:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
information is critical to protecting
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
the public from vaccine preventable
 
05:03:31.440 --> 05:03:32.628 align:start position:0%
the public from vaccine preventable
diseases

05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
and it's also in the best interest of
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
the people documenting vaccination
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
status is part of an infectious disease
 
05:03:40.948 --> 05:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
investigation so there's a number of
 
05:03:43.110 --> 05:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
diseases that require quarantine if
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
you've been exposed including covin-19
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
however if you're vaccinated and you
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
have an exposure you do not need to
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
quarantine after that exposure if an
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
employer or school or the health
 
05:03:55.350 --> 05:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
department is not allowed to ask a
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
person's vaccination status the default
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
will be to exclude the exposed person
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing them to work if
 
05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
they have been fully vaccinated and this
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
will unnecessarily keep people out of
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
work in school
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
furthermore the state of new hampshire
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
and health care providers administering
 
05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine are required to document
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
information for every person who has
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
received a copic 19 vaccine
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is required under federal law and
 
05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're not able to access coven 19
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine if we do not comply with this
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
lastly i want to point out that this
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
amendment conflicts with several
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
existing state laws including school and
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
child care vaccine entry and the
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
immunization registry laws
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
our goal through our immunization policy
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
is to provide public health protection
 
05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
while also appropriately balancing
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
individual choice and under existing law
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
people already have a choice whether to
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
and this amendment would then be
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and not in the best interest
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor any questions for dr
 
05:04:56.798 --> 05:04:58.708 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor any questions for dr
daler

05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
daler
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative stewart
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
and of the population of
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are all that choose to be
 
05:05:15.920 --> 05:05:17.830 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are all that choose to be
vaccinated

05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
we could get into a situation where
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
folks who for medical reasons
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
cannot take the vaccine
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
would be higher risk because they would
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
say go grocery shopping and at that
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
point most likely no one would be
 
05:05:38.070 --> 05:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
wearing masks anymore or very few
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh and they would therefore have
 
05:05:40.638 --> 05:05:42.868 align:start position:0%
uh and they would therefore have
the

05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
added risk of exposure not knowing
 
05:05:50.310 --> 05:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative because the
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
very first part of your sentence cut out
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it did for others could
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
you just repeat the first part
 
05:05:59.190 --> 05:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm saying that
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
if say 50 percent
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of new hampshire decide
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
not to be vaccinated but 50 or so are
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
then there are a percentage of citizens
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
we know who cannot
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine for medical reasons
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
would they not be at higher risk to go
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
about in public
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
as it would likely end up with
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
very few people wearing masks and
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
protecting others
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
if this becomes the the norm
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so that's correct that is
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
why there are immunization requirements
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
in place for schools for example there
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
are a number of very vulnerable
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
children who can have permanent
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
disability and die if they get a vaccine
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
preventable disease but some of them
 
05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
aren't actually able to get vaccinated
 
05:06:52.708 --> 05:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
due to their own health conditions and
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
so they rely on high rates of immunity
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the people around them uh to protect
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
them from getting these these vaccines
 
05:07:01.590 --> 05:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's all sorry from getting these
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
diseases that's also true for
 
05:07:06.868 --> 05:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
covid19 we also need a high enough rate
 
05:07:09.430 --> 05:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
of people to get vaccinated in order to
 
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
protect people from getting coveted
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
again the vaccine's not 100 effective
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's very effective but not 100
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
and there are some people who can't get
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and those parents for example
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
want the people around their child to
 
05:07:24.628 --> 05:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated and they rely on that
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise they wouldn't send their
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
children to school if it's a dangerous
 
05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
environment we have that obligation to
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
protect everyone
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
miss daly
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure that i heard
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
you correctly did you say
 
05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
that if we were to stop keeping records
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
of who was vaccinated for cobit then we
 
05:07:54.150 --> 05:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
would be jeopardizing the availability
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
of those vaccines coming to us
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct under federal law and
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
in order for us to receive the vaccines
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
all health care providers are required
 
05:08:05.350 --> 05:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
to document
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
the vaccination of individuals and share
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
that with their state health department
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
and cdc and so that is why there's an
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
executive order in place mandating the
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
submission of that data in our state
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
so thank you and a really quick
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up would that apply to any any
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
other vaccines do we get other vaccines
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
for free from the federal government or
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure with that yes we
 
05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question we do get uh
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children we're a universal
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
state so we provide vaccines to all
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
would that be jeopardized also
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
no it would not that falls under state
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
law relative to our immunization
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
registry the providers do have to have
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
accountability for those publicly
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
purchased doses but it does not
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be main name based
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
unless there's requirement by the state
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
which falls under immunization registry
 
05:09:02.000 --> 05:09:02.788 align:start position:0%
which falls under immunization registry
law

05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:09:07.750 --> 05:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr leo quick question to
 
05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
clarify something i thought i heard
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
did you say that there are some people
 
05:09:16.080 --> 05:09:16.868 align:start position:0%
did you say that there are some people
who

05:09:16.868 --> 05:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
cannot be vaccinated for
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
reasons of medical risk
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
05:09:23.280 --> 05:09:25.110 align:start position:0%
that's correct
follow-up

05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
should they be prevented from flying on
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
airplanes or riding buses or getting
 
05:09:29.040 --> 05:09:32.470 align:start position:0%
airplanes or riding buses or getting
jobs

05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.480 --> 05:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:09:33.510 --> 05:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
in regards to immunization requirements
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
such as for schools which is really the
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
only thing the state requires regarding
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
immunizations there is a there is a
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
medical exemption so they can be
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
exempted for that purpose
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
should those be people be prevented from
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
riding on buses or in airplanes or from
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
getting jobs
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
there there is no requirement so i can't
 
05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
speak factually too that's exactly what
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm here to speak to what has been
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
specifically put into writing which we
 
05:10:05.040 --> 05:10:05.990 align:start position:0%
specifically put into writing which we
oppose

05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
05:10:06.000 --> 05:10:07.110 align:start position:0%
oppose
right

05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
ask again please
 
05:10:11.590 --> 05:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
should those people be prevented from
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
taking jobs or
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
taking an air flight or a bus ride thank
 
05:10:16.480 --> 05:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
taking an air flight or a bus ride thank
you

05:10:17.110 --> 05:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:10:20.830 --> 05:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
yeah believe the member is being
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
argumentative towards the witness he's
 
05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
asked his question and she answered as
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
best she could
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
mr chairman my question wasn't answered
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
and i find that highly entertaining um
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's okay i don't believe that that
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
falls within this witness's purview uh
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
our area of expertise
 
05:10:42.708 --> 05:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna move along
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative schultz
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious um
 
05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
maybe this is beating a dead horse
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
the conditions that would deem someone
 
05:11:02.230 --> 05:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
unable to have the vaccine
 
05:11:02.240 --> 05:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
unable to have the vaccine
is

05:11:03.030 --> 05:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:11:04.708 --> 05:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
can you describe
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
what those conditions are i imagine one
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
of them would be an allergy to
 
05:11:09.360 --> 05:11:10.150 align:start position:0%
of them would be an allergy to
um

05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
the other vehicles in the vaccine itself
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
i know egg can be one of those but what
 
05:11:17.590 --> 05:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
are what are typically
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
the health conditions that make it
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
impossible for someone to get a vaccine
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
so medical exemption for vaccine is very
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
rare i believe in our childhood
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
population for school entry it's
 
05:11:33.670 --> 05:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
point zero three or point zero four
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
percent of children get a medical
 
05:11:35.360 --> 05:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
percent of children get a medical
exemption

05:11:36.550 --> 05:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
05:11:38.550 --> 05:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
and it depends on the vaccine so for
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
coven 19 it's really focused around
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
allergies or having had a severe
 
05:11:44.550 --> 05:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
reaction to a prior dose of coven 19
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine that's similar for other
 
05:11:48.708 --> 05:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines however there might be some
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
children for example who have a very
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
rare you know immune deficiency and they
 
05:11:54.310 --> 05:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
might not be the time for them to get
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinated until their immune system is
 
05:11:57.200 --> 05:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
vaccinated until their immune system is
normal

05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
normal
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so they're probably not going on an
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
you probably can't answer that that's
 
05:12:04.638 --> 05:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
you probably can't answer that that's
okay

05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
i mean none thank you for your testimony
 
05:12:10.878 --> 05:12:11.830 align:start position:0%
i mean none thank you for your testimony
doctor

05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
05:12:14.708 --> 05:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
put his hand up that should shoot
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative marsh if you're out there
 
05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.878 --> 05:12:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
very good
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh for the record i'm representative
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
william marsh carroll county eight
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%

05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking opposition to this
 
05:13:18.310 --> 05:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment and will refer to
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
line numbers in 1468 h and i will email
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
a copy of my testimony
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendment 1468-h is a non-german
 
05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
amendment prohibiting discrimination
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
based on covet-19 vaccination status but
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
while this has a limited exception for
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
health care facilities the federal

05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
are quoted on page 2 lines 12-22 does
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
not just apply to medical facilities it
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
applies to all employers
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
what about meat packing plants for
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
instance around the country numerous
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
people have contracted covid and some
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
have died in meat packing plants and
 
05:13:59.830 --> 05:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
this has resulted in the closure of the
 
05:14:02.550 --> 05:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
plants new hampshire actually has 12

to protect themselves their employees
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%

add diseases to the list rapidly by
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is senseless when our

05:16:36.550 --> 05:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
given how connected our world is today
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
it is highly likely another virus will

emerge requiring a rapid response
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%

we will have another pandemic but when

will it happen

affairs found that bill and expedient to
 
05:17:28.070 --> 05:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
legislate on a 14-7 vote we heard
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that a similar measure in the
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
state of texas substantially raised the
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
cost of the vaccine registry the journal
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
of public health management practices
 
05:17:39.990 --> 05:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
published in september 2010 reporting
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
that it raised the cost to the health
 
05:17:46.628 --> 05:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
care system from 29 cents to 2.65 cents
 
05:17:47.910 --> 05:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
per child
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment is unnecessary federal
 
05:17:52.868 --> 05:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
law already prohibits mandating vaccines
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
unless there is a direct threat pursuant

the equal employment opportunity
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
commission has upheld this provision and
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
there's considerable case law about
 
05:18:06.550 --> 05:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
employees being terminated for refusing
 
05:18:09.110 --> 05:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinations we do not need to prohibit
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
a vaccine requirement in state law
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
because there is already such a
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
provision in federal law
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
last medically this amendment makes no
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
sense we all want to return to normal
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
where people can again have large group
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
gatherings a voluntary gathering of
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
people who share the knowledge that they
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
have been vaccinated allows this to
 
05:18:28.798 --> 05:18:29.670 align:start position:0%
have been vaccinated allows this to
happen

05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:18:32.070 --> 05:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
if people don't want to get vaccinated
 
05:18:34.390 --> 05:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
they don't need to participate but as a
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
state we need to move on from the social
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
distancing measures and their draconian
 
05:18:41.190 --> 05:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
effect on the economy
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination allows us to do so safely
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
and so the public interest is to
 
05:18:48.628 --> 05:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
encourage vaccination i urge the edna
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee to reject this amendment and i
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking my
 
05:19:07.840 --> 05:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
representative marsh for taking my
question

05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
did i hear you
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
correctly in your testimony that uh
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
number of uh portions of this bill
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
were brought in separate pieces of
 
05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
legislation before the
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
um what i think is the appropriate
 
05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee for this uh amendment the
 
05:19:27.430 --> 05:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
health and human services and was itl
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes the most recent draft of this
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill that i have seen which is 1468 h
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
you may have seen a more recent one i do
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
not know uh section 12
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
is a rewrite of bills we've seen in the
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
past section 13 is a rewrite of house
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill 221 uh and uh page one lines
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
fourteen to seven which i think has been
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
in prior versions of this amendment uh
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
is a rewrite of house bill 506. uh all
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
those bills were found in expedia to
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislate uh by the hhs committee uh but
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
none had final action on the house floor
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
due to the expiration of deadlines so i
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
do not believe it would be a violation
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the house rules to bring this forward
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
however you are correct in your
 
05:20:10.080 --> 05:20:11.670 align:start position:0%
however you are correct in your
assessment

05:20:11.670 --> 05:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:20:21.990 --> 05:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you dr marsh for your testimony
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'll use your
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
professional title instead of your
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
your elective title um because i respect
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
your medical expertise uh and your
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
testimony but my concern is with the
 
05:20:35.840 --> 05:20:36.868 align:start position:0%
testimony but my concern is with the
uh

05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:20:36.878 --> 05:20:38.708 align:start position:0%
uh
situation

05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
that currently exists in the world
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh that reminds me of what happened uh i
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
was not quite as old as i appear and
 
05:20:50.310 --> 05:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
didn't ex experience it in my own
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
lifetime but the great pandemic of 1918
 
05:20:56.550 --> 05:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
started out relatively benignly as i
 
05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
understand it and
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
and developed through mutation
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
into a much more virulent form
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm very concerned about the
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
mutations that are already uh in
 
05:21:12.310 --> 05:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
evidence and especially the situation in
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
india where the vaccine uh is inadequate
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh to the threat uh in terms of
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
availability not efficacy uh and now you
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
have a population of a billion three
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
hundred million people for the vaccine
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
for the virus uh to uh to run wild in
 
05:21:36.788 --> 05:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
does it concern you that the possibility
 
05:21:40.470 --> 05:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
of much more virulent strains uh
 
05:21:43.270 --> 05:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
being developed and subsequently being
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
transported to the united states
 
05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
would could be a tremendous threat to
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire if we do not
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinate our population as effectively
 
05:21:56.150 --> 05:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for that question uh
 
05:21:58.638 --> 05:21:59.590 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you for that question uh
peter

05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
peter
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
you are correct that the vaccine
 
05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
variants are are very much a threat to
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the world's health and the world's
 
05:22:08.470 --> 05:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
economy uh it is believed that the
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
indian variant will become the prevalent
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
strain in the united kingdom
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
i've heard that may very well happen
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
within a matter of days it has appeared
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
in the united states uh the previous
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
variant from united kingdom as i
 
05:22:22.550 --> 05:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
understand at this point in time the
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
prevalent variant in the united states
 
05:22:27.190 --> 05:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
and it has already been shown to be uh
 
05:22:30.550 --> 05:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
more contagious and also affects younger
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
population groups such as the children
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
in the schools uh the indian variant is
 
05:22:36.550 --> 05:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be even more so that way so
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
it may become even more important uh to
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
control uh the the disease through
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination should that happen
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is quite true that the
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination does not prevent all
 
05:22:47.200 --> 05:22:48.550 align:start position:0%
vaccination does not prevent all
infections

05:22:48.550 --> 05:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
infections
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
it reduces the incidence of infection in
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
populations uh however that's also
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's been fairly well established
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
and and just by doing that we minimize
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the spread of disease uh regarding the
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
influenza pandemic uh i was not alive at
 
05:23:07.110 --> 05:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
that time either my grandfather however
 
05:23:09.670 --> 05:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
was practicing medicine in the united
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
states army at the time and i remember
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
some of his stories before he died but
 
05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
not well enough to relate them to people
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up approximately how many
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
people are believed to have died in the
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
great pandemic of 1918 worldwide
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information at my
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
fingertips but i believe google could
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
supply it quite easily it was a large
 
05:23:30.480 --> 05:23:31.670 align:start position:0%
supply it quite easily it was a large
number

05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
right i believe the current estimate is
 
05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
55 million people
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
are believed to have perished at least
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
55 million people
 
05:23:41.360 --> 05:23:42.150 align:start position:0%
55 million people
so

05:23:42.150 --> 05:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:45.990 --> 05:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
we've we've been lucky so far with colby
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
05:23:47.760 --> 05:23:48.868 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
doctor

05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
05:23:52.958 --> 05:23:54.310 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
marsh

05:23:54.310 --> 05:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you pierce so to my friend
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative marsh here
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know you you've you said
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
something here that the prior three
 
05:24:04.320 --> 05:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
something here that the prior three
um

05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
physicians have also said you said that
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
you made the statement of encourage
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
people to get vaccinated
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm trying to as i'm reading through
 
05:24:18.628 --> 05:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
this i'm trying to see where this where
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
this does the opposite where it does not
 
05:24:22.868 --> 05:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
or discourages people from getting the
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine because i don't see that in the
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
light in the language of this
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
at all so
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
if i help me out here if i'm missing
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
this where anything in this
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
non-tremaine amendment here
 
05:24:35.120 --> 05:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
non-tremaine amendment here
discourages

05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
discourages
 
05:24:36.400 --> 05:24:37.270 align:start position:0%
discourages
um

05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
or prevents anybody from being
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
having access to vaccines
 
05:24:45.430 --> 05:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
the the only way it would prevent access
 
05:24:47.990 --> 05:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
to vaccine is an indirect effect if we
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
did not report things appropriately to
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government and therefore
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
lost our access to the coveted vaccines
 
05:24:55.110 --> 05:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
that we are currently being supplied
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
with by the federal government but i
 
05:24:58.948 --> 05:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
agree with you there's no language in
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
the draft of this amendment that i've
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
seen that specifically would prohibit
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you have another
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
question just not take a hand
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out that uh

tim horrigan it's in the waiting room
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
but he did not
 
05:25:30.628 --> 05:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
add representative to the beginning of
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%

today i'm speaking in support of this
 
05:26:20.550 --> 05:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to sb 155 the amendment is
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and is a bold step
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
that we need the legislature must take
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of the residents
 
05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
there isn't much that could be
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
considered more personable personal and
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
inalienable inalienable excuse me than
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
your right to privacy over your health
 
05:26:38.150 --> 05:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
information we have federal laws to
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
protect this privacy and an amendment in
 
05:26:41.830 --> 05:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
our state constitution specifically to
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
protect this right
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
where the federal law
 
05:26:47.110 --> 05:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me laws fall short and where our
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
constitution must be upheld
 
05:26:51.430 --> 05:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation fills in the gaps in
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring this protection
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the committee has heard
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
already from me on this topic so i'm

brief
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
and they are we need this because it
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
protects people from discrimination in
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
good services houses employment
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
education and places of public
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
accommodation based on vaccination or
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
immunity status
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
we need this because it prevents
 
05:27:15.270 --> 05:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
government from requiring vaccination or
 
05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
proof of immunity
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
we need it because it provides for
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
narrow circumstances where vaccines can
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
be required but with provisions for
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
certain exemptions we need this because
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
it takes away the power of the
 
05:27:28.868 --> 05:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dhhs to add vaccines to
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
the school requirements and gives that
 
05:27:33.190 --> 05:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
power to the most representative body of
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the people where it rightfully belongs
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
we need this because it makes the
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry an opt-in registry as
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
it was intended and will stop the
 
05:27:43.510 --> 05:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
practice of tricking people into having
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
their vaccination records including
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
records of declining vaccination entered
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
into a government database
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the point that there is no vaccine
 
05:27:54.628 --> 05:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
mandate requiring proof of immunity is a
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
backdoor mandate we are seeing that
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
government doesn't want to dirty its
 
05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
hands with requiring a mandate so
 
05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
they're using their public officials to
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
push out a message that businesses
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
should do the dirty work and require
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines for people to participate
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
um dr raymond wallston he he claims that
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines prevent cancer in children i i
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
am interested in seeing
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
what cancers and where that data comes
 
05:28:25.270 --> 05:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
from he's he's wrong and respectfully
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
about the school requirements for
 
05:28:28.390 --> 05:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines because in new hampshire we
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
have exemptions and the private and
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
public schools have the same
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for exemptions under the
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
law so
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
regardless of where you send your kids
 
05:28:38.548 --> 05:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
they're still subject to those
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
requirements and exemptions
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
i'm glad he brought up the anecdote of
 
05:28:44.708 --> 05:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
the child dying of a vaccine preventable
 
05:28:47.830 --> 05:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
illness but however you know no illness
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
is completely vaccine preventable as
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
every vaccine has a unique failure rate
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
and some are more effective than others
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to prove that an
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated person was responsible for
 
05:29:01.590 --> 05:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh unvaccinated child
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
contracting that illness when vaccines
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
are not 100 effective
 
05:29:08.230 --> 05:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
public schools are the only place we
 
05:29:11.030 --> 05:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
have ever had uh requirements for
 
05:29:13.510 --> 05:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry public and private schools and
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
children's day care so the only places
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
we've ever had school requirements in
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we've always had
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions so no one's forced to
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinate their children and it's not
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
just medical exemptions we have
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions as well
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and unvaccinated children go
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
to school together and that medical
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
information of of who is vaccinated and
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
who's not is protected and private
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
um it is true that over four thousand
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
deaths have been reported to the vaccine
 
05:29:40.948 --> 05:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
adverse event reporting system
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
associated with coving 19 vaccinations
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
you can check the varus data for
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
yourself it's open to the public and to
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
ignore this and pretend it's not
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
happening as dr daley did is dangerous
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
and harmful
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
what she said highlights the nature of
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
the problem with vaccine sciences touted
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
by public health officials
 
05:30:00.150 --> 05:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
they're complicit in overstating the
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
benefits while downplaying the risks
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
medical exemption for vaccination is
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
rare because we have a negative feedback
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
loop where
 
05:30:11.670 --> 05:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory agencies and
 
05:30:13.830 --> 05:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
public health officials say that vaccine
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
injury doesn't happen there's no adverse
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
effects it's super rare one in a million
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
so doctors don't recognize it when a
 
05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
patient tells them they've had a
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
reaction they they ignore it or tell
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
them that it's not from that and then
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
they don't report them to the vaccine
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
adverse um event reporting system
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
uh which feeds back into the idea that
 
05:30:36.708 --> 05:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
there are none none happening i have
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
patients who have experienced this
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
and i am a registered nurse i don't know
 
05:30:42.310 --> 05:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
if i mention that
 
05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
to representative marsha's point that
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the federal rules allow for vaccination
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions i'm i'm very familiar with
 
05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
that most employers are not and they
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
believe they can require vaccinations
 
05:30:53.830 --> 05:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
and they do and they get away with it
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
because it's expensive and time
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
consuming to sue for wrongful
 
05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
termination the federal rule only
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
protects employees and only when they
 
05:31:02.470 --> 05:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
have a religious objection or medical
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
condition that contradicts getting the
 
05:31:04.000 --> 05:31:05.350 align:start position:0%
condition that contradicts getting the
vaccine

05:31:05.350 --> 05:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
so you know even
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you have a philosophical or a
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge or a values based or cultural
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
based reason
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
you should still not have to get a
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
vaccination in my opinion it should be
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
for any reason
 
05:31:18.480 --> 05:31:19.910 align:start position:0%
for any reason
uh

05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative marsh is right about
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
including measles and that was probably
 
05:31:24.390 --> 05:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
an overlooked by the sponsor when
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
writing the bill trying to ensure that
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
all the required school vaccinations
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently in place are in statute when
 
05:31:32.948 --> 05:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
we take away that authority from the
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
dhhs commissioner as we should um to his
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
mention of the osha requirement uh dr
 
05:31:39.360 --> 05:31:40.310 align:start position:0%
mention of the osha requirement uh dr
marsh

05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
about um
 
05:31:44.708 --> 05:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
offering hepatitis b vaccines offering a
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination is different than from
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
requiring it
 
05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
it's important unfortunate that some
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
members of the health human services and
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
elderly affairs committee in the house
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
um have not internalized their training
 
05:31:59.270 --> 05:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
in medical ethics those have had that
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
have had it but i didn't forget what i
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
learned in in nursing ethics and the or
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
the oath that i swore to uphold the code
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
of ethics that governs my nursing
 
05:32:08.558 --> 05:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
of ethics that governs my nursing
practice

05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
um and the first provision of that code
 
05:32:13.270 --> 05:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
of ethics is for me to protect the
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
rights of my patients it's to protect
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
their dignity and that includes their
 
05:32:17.600 --> 05:32:19.030 align:start position:0%
their dignity and that includes their
autonomy

05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
um and their self-determination so we
 
05:32:23.350 --> 05:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
can never force coerce
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
um we can't overly push anybody into
 
05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
taking a medical treatment
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
um i the oath i took as a legislator is
 
05:32:32.310 --> 05:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
to uphold the constitution of new
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and all of this brings statute
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
in line with the constitution the proper
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
role of government is to protect the
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
rights of the people separating people
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
into different classes based on their
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
private health information is an
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
abomination that flies in the face
 
05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
of all medical ethics
 
05:32:49.120 --> 05:32:50.548 align:start position:0%
of all medical ethics
advancement

05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
advancement
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
this committee must stand strong and not
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
be swayed by bureaucrat bureaucrats who
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
will testify in opposition to this bill
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
no matter what industry talking points
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
they they have the rights of individuals
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
are first and foremost please do the
 
05:33:06.788 --> 05:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
right thing
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
i will not take questions thank you
 
05:33:14.548 --> 05:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:33:14.558 --> 05:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
representative

05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
i did want to answer one point she
 
05:33:17.600 --> 05:33:19.670 align:start position:0%
i did want to answer one point she
raised

05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
raised
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
she asked for information about cancer
 
05:33:26.310 --> 05:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
the adpd vaccine
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.670 --> 05:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schulzel though
 
05:33:37.750 --> 05:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think you were out of order
 
05:33:37.760 --> 05:33:38.628 align:start position:0%
i think you were out of order
um

05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
i understand that but he did not make
 
05:33:43.590 --> 05:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
that distinction and that's why i was
 
05:33:43.600 --> 05:33:44.788 align:start position:0%
that distinction and that's why i was
questioning

05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
05:33:46.390 --> 05:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of data they were looking at
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
it sounded like it was broad childhood
 
05:33:50.470 --> 05:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
cancer data
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
children are the ones who get the hpv
 
05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going to uh engage in argument
 
05:34:05.430 --> 05:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
with the witnesses please and everyone
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
please be reminded unless i recognize
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
you um no speaking all right it's going
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
to get contentious enough as it is sorry
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
i wasn't trying to be contentious just
 
05:34:16.628 --> 05:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
05:34:22.830 --> 05:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
oregon will be next with some
 
05:34:25.350 --> 05:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
promotions and also mr chairman uh
 
05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
senator sherman has asked to be
 
05:34:27.440 --> 05:34:29.430 align:start position:0%
senator sherman has asked to be
recognized

05:34:29.430 --> 05:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:34:29.440 --> 05:34:30.470 align:start position:0%
recognized

dr sherman needs to leave he tells me
 
05:34:32.798 --> 05:34:33.590 align:start position:0%
dr sherman needs to leave he tells me
and

05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
and

we should hear him before we hear
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
senator you you are good to go
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh members of the committee
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
can you hear me mr chair
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
we hear you thank you
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
okay for the record my name is uh
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
senator tom sherman
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
i represent district 24 i'm also a
 
05:35:10.708 --> 05:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
physician in clinical practice
 
05:35:10.718 --> 05:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
physician in clinical practice
for

05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
and so today i speak
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
in both roles and i i have to tell you
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
that uh i couldn't
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's remarkable to me
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
how much you've heard today that just is
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
and i'll stick with the science first of
 
05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
all there are multiple vaccines
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
that protect against cancer in my world
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
in gastroenterology the hepatitis b
 
05:35:41.120 --> 05:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
in gastroenterology the hepatitis b
vaccine

05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
is probably the most prominent
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
it prevents hepatocellular carcinoma
 
05:35:51.430 --> 05:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
but hpv also present prevents both
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
oral i'm sorry ear nose and throat
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
cancer so
 
05:36:02.470 --> 05:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
another fact that is not a fact that you
 
05:36:02.480 --> 05:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
another fact that is not a fact that you
heard

05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that antibodies if you have positive
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
antibodies you don't need a vaccine that
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
is false
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
if you have antibodies and have prior
 
05:36:11.840 --> 05:36:13.270 align:start position:0%
if you have antibodies and have prior
exposure

05:36:13.270 --> 05:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
05:36:16.948 --> 05:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's unclear your level of protection
 
05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is becoming clearer as studies are
 
05:36:19.520 --> 05:36:20.868 align:start position:0%
it is becoming clearer as studies are
being

05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:36:20.878 --> 05:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
being
completed

05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
completed
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
but the vaccines have shown
 
05:36:25.360 --> 05:36:27.030 align:start position:0%
but the vaccines have shown
remarkable

05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
remarkable
 
05:36:27.040 --> 05:36:28.470 align:start position:0%
remarkable
persistent

05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
persistent
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
protection across multiple variants
 
05:36:31.520 --> 05:36:32.548 align:start position:0%
protection across multiple variants
and

05:36:32.548 --> 05:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
based on the immunology of uh of
 
05:36:35.600 --> 05:36:36.948 align:start position:0%
based on the immunology of uh of
exposure

05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
an antibody to one
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
particular strain of the virus
 
05:36:44.470 --> 05:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
with which you were infected does not
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily confer
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh immune immunity to other strains
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and in the vaccines case that's why
 
05:36:54.150 --> 05:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about whether or not
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
a booster is necessary to broaden the
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
coverage or to reinforce the coverage
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:04.788 --> 05:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
i would point out that you have some
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
people who came in
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
by zoom from out of town
 
05:37:10.708 --> 05:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
who do not have clinical experience a
 
05:37:13.350 --> 05:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
pathologist does not see patients they
 
05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
see slides and they do forensics
 
05:37:16.558 --> 05:37:17.670 align:start position:0%
see slides and they do forensics
so

05:37:17.670 --> 05:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
you are hearing from clinical
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
practitioners from dartmouth and from me
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
05:37:28.548 --> 05:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
who are
 
05:37:31.830 --> 05:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
fully in support of our current statute
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
and i do not believe that this broad
 
05:37:34.160 --> 05:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
and i do not believe that this broad
brush

05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
brush
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh is going to be at all helpful in fact
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
it is likely going to harm the people of
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i'll repeat that this
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendment would harm the people of new
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire because what we understand
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
about vaccines
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that vaccines
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent based on the science not based
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
on several of the people who've been
 
05:37:56.788 --> 05:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
talking today
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
based on the science they represent the
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
second most important
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
tool we have in public health the first
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
most important
 
05:38:07.990 --> 05:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
occurred back in the 1800s which was the
 
05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
development of public septic and
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water supply
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
the second most important was vaccine if
 
05:38:16.708 --> 05:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
you look at its effectiveness whether
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's polio small packs smallpox
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
these vaccines have saved hundreds of
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
millions of lives across the world and
 
05:38:26.310 --> 05:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
yet this
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill this amendment
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
would prohibit reduce and otherwise
 
05:38:31.200 --> 05:38:32.470 align:start position:0%
would prohibit reduce and otherwise
decrease

05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh our ability to follow the public
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
health and science on vaccination
 
05:38:38.480 --> 05:38:39.270 align:start position:0%
health and science on vaccination
and

05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
really the last thing i would say is
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
that the way i think about vaccines
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
there are some that benefit just the
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
person getting the vaccine a great
 
05:38:51.510 --> 05:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
example is tetanus you get a tetanus
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine if you can get one
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't have an adverse reaction
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
and you don't get tetanus
 
05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the vaccines varicella
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
rubiola pertussis
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
these are ones that protect not just me
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
but they protect many other people and
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
i was in a hearing on the senate side
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
where a gentleman
 
05:39:20.230 --> 05:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
testified he was a doctor he testified
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
he came from out of town i won't say
 
05:39:22.240 --> 05:39:23.350 align:start position:0%
he came from out of town i won't say
where

05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
but his advice given to a community
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
resulted in the second largest measles
 
05:39:30.470 --> 05:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
outbreak in the country
 
05:39:33.270 --> 05:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
and he was removed from the board of
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
practice by the board of medicine from
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
practicing in a state in
 
05:39:39.510 --> 05:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the united states
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important to know
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
who's giving the testimony
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
and when i look across the board at our
 
05:39:50.230 --> 05:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
doctor from dartmouth or dr marsh
 
05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
or my own testimony you're talking
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
people from new hampshire
 
05:39:56.788 --> 05:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
love new hampshire
 
05:39:56.798 --> 05:39:57.750 align:start position:0%
love new hampshire
and

05:39:57.750 --> 05:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:59.590 --> 05:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
love the people of new hampshire are
 
05:40:02.150 --> 05:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated both in the legislature and
 
05:40:04.948 --> 05:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
also in our practice of madison
 
05:40:06.628 --> 05:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
and our number one thing in our
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
hippocratic oath is do no harm and we
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
fully support the public health tools
 
05:40:13.990 --> 05:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
that are needed to provide vaccination
 
05:40:17.350 --> 05:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
to as many people as can and will
 
05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing in there that says
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
that an adult who does not want a
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and i'll take any
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
05:40:31.510 --> 05:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:40:32.788 --> 05:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
senator thank you for taking that
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
question you you are wearing two hacks
 
05:40:38.470 --> 05:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
today and uh so i'll ask one to your
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
other side uh not the physician side and
 
05:40:44.310 --> 05:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
do you think that people should be
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
um i think the key word there is force i
 
05:40:56.868 --> 05:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
am not i am not in favor of vaccine
 
05:40:56.878 --> 05:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
am not i am not in favor of vaccine
passports

05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
passports
 
05:41:01.350 --> 05:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
i am not in favor of vaccine mandates
 
05:41:01.360 --> 05:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
i am not in favor of vaccine mandates
except

05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
except
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
where they
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
affect the public health which is what
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
we currently have which are children who
 
05:41:09.430 --> 05:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
are going into a
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
public system like the public schools
 
05:41:13.830 --> 05:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i also don't believe it's the role
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to tell businesses
 
05:41:17.910 --> 05:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
what they can and can't do
 
05:41:19.990 --> 05:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
if a business feels that
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
they want their employees to be
 
05:41:21.680 --> 05:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
they want their employees to be
vaccinated

05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's up to the business
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
is it um follow-up question please um
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard this um point made several
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
times about us
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
stepping outside of our role telling
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
businesses what they should and
 
05:41:41.110 --> 05:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do
 
05:41:41.120 --> 05:41:42.070 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do
i

05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
find this interesting because in the
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature here in new hampshire and
 
05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
across the country that's what we do on
 
05:41:50.830 --> 05:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
again i'm not sure i
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
got the answer to my question should
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
be allowing other citizens to force
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
other citizens to be vaccinated
 
05:42:06.788 --> 05:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
and again
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
well again i will i will ask you know as
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment is that
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
coercing or forcing
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:42:16.948 --> 05:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
that that's part of the definition i
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe
 
05:42:20.948 --> 05:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
if an adult makes a sound a sound mind
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
and body makes a choice
 
05:42:23.360 --> 05:42:24.470 align:start position:0%
and body makes a choice
uh

05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know to not get a vaccine there are
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
likely going to be consequences
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
that come along with that
 
05:42:34.070 --> 05:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
does that mean that i'm forcing them to
 
05:42:35.830 --> 05:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
get a vaccine absolutely not i'm not
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
coercing them i'm not forcing them i'm
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
saying that's your choice
 
05:42:42.070 --> 05:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
and as a private business owner i also
 
05:42:43.590 --> 05:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
have a choice
 
05:42:43.600 --> 05:42:44.470 align:start position:0%
have a choice
and

05:42:44.470 --> 05:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:45.510 --> 05:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's unusual to hear you
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
saying that you want to write regulate
 
05:42:52.470 --> 05:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
private businesses but that's what i'm
 
05:42:52.480 --> 05:42:53.670 align:start position:0%
private businesses but that's what i'm
hearing

05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
or regulate them more i'm surprised at
 
05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:42:59.500 --> 05:42:59.510 align:start position:0%
that's what you're telling me
 
05:42:59.510 --> 05:43:00.868 align:start position:0%
that's what you're telling me
[Music]

05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
no actually i'm i'm not
 
05:43:04.708 --> 05:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
saying that but that's neither here nor
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
there it's not so important what i say
 
05:43:07.360 --> 05:43:08.230 align:start position:0%
there it's not so important what i say
um

05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:08.240 --> 05:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
um
coercion

05:43:09.350 --> 05:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
05:43:09.360 --> 05:43:10.390 align:start position:0%
coercion
force

05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
force
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the word be
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
is it not forcing someone
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you tell them you'll be vaccinated or
 
05:43:19.590 --> 05:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
you can't have this job or
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
you can't ride this bus or
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
is that not coercion thank you and
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
that'll follow up no i'll answer that
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'll say no that's not coercion
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
coercion is if i said
 
05:43:31.520 --> 05:43:32.470 align:start position:0%
coercion is if i said
uh

05:43:32.470 --> 05:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot walk down a road without a
 
05:43:37.510 --> 05:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine and say you cannot leave your
 
05:43:37.520 --> 05:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
vaccine and say you cannot leave your
house

05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:43:39.910 --> 05:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
without a vaccine
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
that is something where you know we had
 
05:43:43.830 --> 05:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
a stay-at-home order and i know some
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
people disagreed with that
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
that is a public health measure
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
but if you have available vaccine and a
 
05:43:53.430 --> 05:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
private business says to you
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
i choose as a business owner not to have
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
people working here putting in my other
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
employees at risk
 
05:44:04.080 --> 05:44:04.948 align:start position:0%
employees at risk
then

05:44:04.948 --> 05:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
you can choose as a potential employee
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not to participate in that
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
business you have that choice that
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit under any definition of
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
coercion or forced employment in my
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of the dictionary
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
05:44:22.000 --> 05:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
representative

05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
senator sherman is as serious as all
 
05:44:28.230 --> 05:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is i've got to ask you 35 years
 
05:44:31.510 --> 05:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
where's your fountain of youth
 
05:44:33.670 --> 05:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i started well i went to med school
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
let's see i graduated in 1987.
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
so i've been in clinical medicine since
 
05:44:38.798 --> 05:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
so i've been in clinical medicine since
then

05:44:40.390 --> 05:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative judy
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair uh senator
 
05:44:48.628 --> 05:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh i received so many emails
 
05:44:48.638 --> 05:44:50.310 align:start position:0%
uh i received so many emails
from

05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
my constituents in one three
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
one of them uh
 
05:44:54.798 --> 05:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
one of them uh
could

05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
i think the long-term effects
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:45:03.990 --> 05:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine may be very destructive
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
to our natural broad-based human system
 
05:45:12.070 --> 05:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to know uh if
 
05:45:14.868 --> 05:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
this constitute is uh is what he's
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
saying is true or not please
 
05:45:18.320 --> 05:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
saying is true or not please
so

05:45:19.510 --> 05:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:45:20.948 --> 05:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
let me make sure i've got the question
 
05:45:20.958 --> 05:45:21.830 align:start position:0%
let me make sure i've got the question
correct

05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
are you asking whether i believe there
 
05:45:26.708 --> 05:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
is long-term destruction to the immune
 
05:45:28.150 --> 05:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
system from
 
05:45:32.628 --> 05:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
because the the amendment is all
 
05:45:36.628 --> 05:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines so
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
although the title says covet the
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:42.798 --> 05:45:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:45:47.430 --> 05:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
so so i'm just trying to clarify
 
05:45:49.430 --> 05:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
are you asking about the covet vaccine
 
05:45:52.390 --> 05:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
or all vaccines
 
05:45:52.400 --> 05:45:54.868 align:start position:0%
or all vaccines
especially

05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
especially
 
05:45:56.390 --> 05:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
i know of
 
05:45:56.400 --> 05:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
i know of
no

05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:45:57.680 --> 05:45:58.868 align:start position:0%
no
evidence

05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
05:45:58.878 --> 05:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
evidence
that

05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:02.470 --> 05:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
a a long-term
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
immune destruction or impact on the
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
immune system other than
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
protection against getting
 
05:46:10.320 --> 05:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
protection against getting
coveted

05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
coveted
 
05:46:15.510 --> 05:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
is a side effect of the vaccine
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
what i would say though is that people
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
have quoted the number of deaths from
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and i think that has to be
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
taken in the context of the
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
more than 100 million people who have
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:32.470 --> 05:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know 4 000 or 2 000 deaths that's
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
any death is one too many
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
but when you look at covid in any age
 
05:46:36.878 --> 05:46:38.948 align:start position:0%
but when you look at covid in any age
group

05:46:38.948 --> 05:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:46:41.270 --> 05:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
it has a much higher mortality than that
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:50.160 --> 05:46:52.868 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:46:55.030 --> 05:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is my question
 
05:46:55.040 --> 05:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
this is my question
um

05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
what do you think
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
if someone take the cove vaccine shots
 
05:47:03.670 --> 05:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
that will protect that person from
 
05:47:11.110 --> 05:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
does it protect them from variants
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
is that what you're asking
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes well you know that we haven't
 
05:47:17.040 --> 05:47:17.910 align:start position:0%
yes well you know that we haven't
studied

05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
studied
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
or all of the variants have not been
 
05:47:22.470 --> 05:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
studied because variants keep emerging
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
but it's very encouraging that at least
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
the pfizer
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
and the moderna vaccines
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
do offer fairly broad immunity
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh not a hundred percent by any stretch
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
but as uh earlier stated no vaccine
 
05:47:39.430 --> 05:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
offers a hundred percent immunity
 
05:47:39.440 --> 05:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
offers a hundred percent immunity
but

05:47:40.390 --> 05:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:47:43.270 --> 05:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
it does offer broad immunity against
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
most of the variants that are out there
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
we know yet about india
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
but the beauty of this process
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
is that you can take the variants that
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
are known say in the fall
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
they develop a
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
a booster that would address the new
 
05:48:02.958 --> 05:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
a booster that would address the new
variants

05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
variants
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
then you don't need to go through the
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
two vaccine series that you went through
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
for modern or pfizer you would get
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
updated with a booster like you do for
 
05:48:11.520 --> 05:48:12.708 align:start position:0%
updated with a booster like you do for
tetanus

05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
tetanus
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
but it would
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
be a booster that would not only
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
reinforce what you've already
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
gained immunity to but also be able to
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i was trying to find the button
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
um dr sherman is it not true that um
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
with most viruses particularly
 
05:48:47.990 --> 05:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
the coveted strains
 
05:48:50.548 --> 05:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
that we can expect to see variants
 
05:48:52.470 --> 05:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
coming forward
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.360 --> 05:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:58.400 --> 05:49:00.390 align:start position:0%
um
that's

05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
so your question is are we anticipating
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
more variants in the future
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
from what it's my understanding that
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
it's the nature of viruses too
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes it is kind of a path around
 
05:49:13.920 --> 05:49:16.868 align:start position:0%
yes it is kind of a path around
preventions

05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:19.590 --> 05:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
well it yeah it actually is and some of
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
the more wily viruses like hepatitis c
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
for example we don't have a vaccine to
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
it because it changes
 
05:49:28.470 --> 05:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
so quickly that we can't develop a
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
reach a persistent marker on the virus
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have a vaccine
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have treatment
 
05:49:36.558 --> 05:49:37.750 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have treatment
um

05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
albeit very expensive treatment um
 
05:49:40.240 --> 05:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
albeit very expensive treatment um
the

05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:44.628 --> 05:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the options we have for
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
05:49:46.320 --> 05:49:47.750 align:start position:0%
dealing with
um

05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
covid for the future since it will
 
05:49:52.948 --> 05:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
continue to mutate like viruses do
 
05:49:56.310 --> 05:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
our number one we could continue
 
05:49:56.320 --> 05:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
our number one we could continue
to

05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:50:00.070 --> 05:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
be uh to practice the same level of
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
social distancing and masking and all
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
the other
 
05:50:03.680 --> 05:50:07.190 align:start position:0%
the other
uh

05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:09.190 --> 05:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
precautions that we have put in place
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
until we develop the virus the vaccine
 
05:50:14.830 --> 05:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
or we could continue to
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
um move the vaccine as robustly as
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
people will allow so that
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
we get ahead of the variance so that we
 
05:50:23.280 --> 05:50:24.628 align:start position:0%
we get ahead of the variance so that we
provide

05:50:24.628 --> 05:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
a level of immunity and you know what
 
05:50:30.628 --> 05:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
they have seen which is which is true of
 
05:50:33.030 --> 05:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
many vaccines is that there is some
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
degree of what's called cross reactivity
 
05:50:37.830 --> 05:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
in other words the vaccine will actually
 
05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
help even if it's a variant and that's
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
what they're seeing
 
05:50:44.310 --> 05:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
the original vaccines were designed for
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
type of of
 
05:50:47.120 --> 05:50:48.708 align:start position:0%
type of of
covid

05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
covid
 
05:50:50.708 --> 05:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
but we're finding that they are actually
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
effective across many of the different
 
05:50:54.150 --> 05:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
variants and
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
so not only will vaccines decrease the
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
spread of covid through our population
 
05:51:02.788 --> 05:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
but they also
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide a certain amount of protection
 
05:51:06.000 --> 05:51:07.110 align:start position:0%
provide a certain amount of protection
um

05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:09.190 --> 05:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
against the variants even ones that they
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator
 
05:51:19.800 --> 05:51:19.810 align:start position:0%
you bet thank you
 
05:51:19.810 --> 05:51:21.430 align:start position:0%
you bet thank you

next i will call uh representative leon
 
05:51:27.510 --> 05:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
you had your hand raised
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you very much mr chair for
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question and committee members
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
for hearing such uh
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
thorough discussions from from from
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
everyone for the record i am erica leon
 
05:51:40.150 --> 05:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
state representative from derry and a
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
former wall street medical device
 
05:51:41.600 --> 05:51:43.110 align:start position:0%
former wall street medical device
analyst

05:51:43.110 --> 05:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
analyst
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
i speak to you today as somebody who
 
05:51:46.948 --> 05:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
worked in drug and device development
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
who was highly involved in the fda
 
05:51:51.350 --> 05:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
approval process
 
05:51:54.150 --> 05:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
who has studied a lot of medical ethics
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
and has also been involved in the
 
05:51:59.350 --> 05:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
learning process after the sars pandemic
 
05:52:00.628 --> 05:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
and how
 
05:52:02.470 --> 05:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
the knowledge there could have been was
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
used in order to streamline the vaccine
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
development process and make sure that
 
05:52:09.270 --> 05:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
something gets out to people
 
05:52:11.830 --> 05:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
my first point is that despite best
 
05:52:14.230 --> 05:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
efforts this is a long process there are
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of necessary stops along the way
 
05:52:17.990 --> 05:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
as you find
 
05:52:20.708 --> 05:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
a vaccine candidate as you develop it
 
05:52:22.708 --> 05:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
and as you grow it along the process in
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that it's not going
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
to hurt people and hopefully it will
 
05:52:26.000 --> 05:52:27.350 align:start position:0%
to hurt people and hopefully it will
help

05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
when we had the best minds from industry
 
05:52:31.750 --> 05:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
they they saw it as a pipe dream to get
 
05:52:33.030 --> 05:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
something based off of standard
 
05:52:35.510 --> 05:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
technology out the door in nine months
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we've seen practically a miracle
 
05:52:39.030 --> 05:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
with the availability of this coveted
 
05:52:39.040 --> 05:52:40.470 align:start position:0%
with the availability of this coveted
vaccine

05:52:40.470 --> 05:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's clear that there is a lot of
 
05:52:43.830 --> 05:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
interest in it and if we look at the
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
fact that a third of americans are
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
already vaccinated without any coercion
 
05:52:50.470 --> 05:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
or force it shows that education is
 
05:52:50.480 --> 05:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
or force it shows that education is
working

05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we have one of the
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
highest seat belt
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
rates in the country
 
05:53:00.628 --> 05:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
yet we don't mandate seat belts for
 
05:53:00.638 --> 05:53:01.830 align:start position:0%
yet we don't mandate seat belts for
adults

05:53:01.830 --> 05:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
adults
 
05:53:03.750 --> 05:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
we trust that people here can look at
 
05:53:06.310 --> 05:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
the information make wise decisions and
 
05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
not be forced to act in a way that
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
protects themselves and others
 
05:53:12.948 --> 05:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
what we're debating here is whether or
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
not businesses can be used to implement
 
05:53:19.110 --> 05:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
public health policy
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
if we can if we allow businesses
 
05:53:24.868 --> 05:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
to require proof of vaccination or
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
immunity to
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
conduct business or go into a facility
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is a huge leap
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
this is a problem if we are asking or
 
05:53:39.670 --> 05:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
allowing businesses to be an enforcement
 
05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
arm for public health
 
05:53:44.470 --> 05:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
there is informed consent
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
there is informed consent that is
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
required for anybody to take or
 
05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
participate in the clinical trial and
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
while we have a large amount of
 
05:53:55.510 --> 05:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
information that suggests that this
 
05:53:57.670 --> 05:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine is beneficial we don't have
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
enough to force its use among the
 
05:54:02.470 --> 05:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
population we can't force people to make
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
that choice
 
05:54:06.070 --> 05:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
and if you look to other states we have
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
california where they're opening up and
 
05:54:09.910 --> 05:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
they're allowing people into the
 
05:54:11.670 --> 05:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
amusement parks but if you're from out
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
of state you need to prove your status
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is the sort of thing that moves
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
across the country obviously we're not
 
05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to do that as government
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
but we also need to make sure that there
 
05:54:25.510 --> 05:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
is no discrimination based upon vaccine
 
05:54:25.520 --> 05:54:26.708 align:start position:0%
is no discrimination based upon vaccine
status

05:54:26.708 --> 05:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:54:29.110 --> 05:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
we worked incredibly hard in the 80s to
 
05:54:30.070 --> 05:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was not
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon a far more
 
05:54:35.430 --> 05:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
fatal disease hiv
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've worked on many other issues that
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
do have public health implications to
 
05:54:41.190 --> 05:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is not
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination on that basis
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm confident that with information
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
many people will make a choice to get
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
take the coven 19 vaccine
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
but coercing people is going to dig in a
 
05:54:56.948 --> 05:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
lot of heels and make some people who
 
05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise might get the vaccine
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
say no you're not going to force me to
 
05:55:02.310 --> 05:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
and we need to not lie to ourselves if
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
we allow businesses to do this we are
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
allowing this back doorway to force
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
people to be vaccinated
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
and that is unacceptable
 
05:55:15.430 --> 05:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:16.390 --> 05:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair representative leon
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
how is it forcing someone
 
05:55:28.470 --> 05:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
to take vaccine if an employer
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
just says this condition of employment
 
05:55:33.510 --> 05:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
but you can choose to be employed
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
someplace that does not force you to do
 
05:55:35.680 --> 05:55:37.990 align:start position:0%
someplace that does not force you to do
that

05:55:37.990 --> 05:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:55:38.948 --> 05:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:55:38.958 --> 05:55:40.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

05:55:40.310 --> 05:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
do we allow employers to fire people for
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
other personal decisions say as to
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
say as to um
 
05:55:50.470 --> 05:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other choices that you
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
have you know you can say whether or not
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
who you love is a person is a choice
 
05:55:58.628 --> 05:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
but to just openly discuss your status
 
05:56:01.270 --> 05:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
is is a choice that some people make i
 
05:56:02.628 --> 05:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
have family members who have been very
 
05:56:04.470 --> 05:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
quiet about that are we allowed to
 
05:56:13.990 --> 05:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
05:56:24.310 --> 05:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative um for your testimony
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful um
 
05:56:30.230 --> 05:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
my question to you is uh i have received
 
05:56:33.830 --> 05:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
lots of lots of emails with this uh
 
05:56:33.840 --> 05:56:34.948 align:start position:0%
lots of lots of emails with this uh
amendment

05:56:34.948 --> 05:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
um and i've tried to read each one of
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
them even if they're saying the same
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
thing over and over again in many cases
 
05:56:43.750 --> 05:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh i still look to see who they are and
 
05:56:46.150 --> 05:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
where they're from and what their issues
 
05:56:46.160 --> 05:56:47.030 align:start position:0%
where they're from and what their issues
are

05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that uh is coming
 
05:56:52.150 --> 05:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
up pretty frequently is the idea of
 
05:56:54.788 --> 05:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
of the idea of uh not wanting to create
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
a two-tiered system
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
um and you're you've kind of been
 
05:57:01.190 --> 05:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
cutting at that the edge of that
 
05:57:03.270 --> 05:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
in your testimony as well
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
but the the amendment
 
05:57:08.548 --> 05:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh restricts
 
05:57:09.590 --> 05:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
all the
 
05:57:11.670 --> 05:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
business entities that
 
05:57:14.230 --> 05:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh that do business with the state in
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
virtually any way
 
05:57:20.070 --> 05:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
and would deny them uh their
 
05:57:21.910 --> 05:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
continuation of their contracts and so
 
05:57:23.430 --> 05:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
forth i don't know whether you've gotten
 
05:57:24.548 --> 05:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
any of these
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
emails or not
 
05:57:26.000 --> 05:57:26.708 align:start position:0%
emails or not
but

05:57:26.708 --> 05:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:57:28.150 --> 05:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
if we
 
05:57:30.150 --> 05:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
if we prohibit all the businesses that
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
do business with the state
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
05:57:35.910 --> 05:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
doing anything along the lines of
 
05:57:35.920 --> 05:57:37.030 align:start position:0%
doing anything along the lines of
requiring

05:57:37.030 --> 05:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
05:57:39.030 --> 05:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination or
 
05:57:42.830 --> 05:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
coercing vaccination or or suggesting
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination phrased in different ways
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
if if if we prohibit that group of thing
 
05:57:50.548 --> 05:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
and we don't prohibit all businesses
 
05:57:52.230 --> 05:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
from doing it
 
05:57:55.510 --> 05:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh aren't we creating a two-tier system
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
thoughtful question um
 
05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
this is the question of the carrot or
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
the stick if we are using this if we're
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
allowing business some businesses to use
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
the stick to say that without proof of
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine you may not do business with us
 
05:58:11.680 --> 05:58:12.390 align:start position:0%
vaccine you may not do business with us
that

05:58:12.390 --> 05:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
that absolutely is a problem and i i
 
05:58:15.670 --> 05:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
think that this should apply to all
 
05:58:17.830 --> 05:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
businesses because just because
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
hannaford market basket and chaws don't
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
receive government i'm not sure if they
 
05:58:23.510 --> 05:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
receive government funding but i don't
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
think they do just because they don't
 
05:58:27.670 --> 05:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
may not receive it doesn't mean that if
 
05:58:29.190 --> 05:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
they all decide
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
that they want to require proof of
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination in order to shop
 
05:58:33.440 --> 05:58:34.150 align:start position:0%
vaccination in order to shop
i

05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:58:36.628 --> 05:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
will be left going to other places like
 
05:58:38.868 --> 05:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
growing my own garden raising my own
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
food or going to co-ops
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
denial of access to a whole class of
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
industries say if all of the grocery
 
05:58:48.080 --> 05:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
industries say if all of the grocery
stores

05:58:49.270 --> 05:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
stores
 
05:58:51.670 --> 05:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
require proof of vaccination that would
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
be an undue hardship and that would go
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
even further than jim crow laws did in
 
05:58:57.430 --> 05:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
the south
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
schmidt just for a point of
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
clarification the current uh iteration
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the amendment actually prohibits all
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
business not just businesses that do
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
aha that's the newest version is this a
 
05:59:13.590 --> 05:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on that amendment as well
 
05:59:15.990 --> 05:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it doesn't seem like it is
 
05:59:16.000 --> 05:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it doesn't seem like it is
yes

05:59:17.080 --> 05:59:17.090 align:start position:0%
yes

my testimony um
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
i've been a new hampshire doctor for now
 
05:59:50.628 --> 05:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
for more than 40 years and if i count as
 
05:59:52.868 --> 05:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh dr sherman did from the time i
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
graduated medical school um
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
25 44 years i think
 
05:59:59.600 --> 06:00:00.548 align:start position:0%
25 44 years i think
um

06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
and with apologies i came in quite late
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
i was tied up at a meeting so i missed
 
06:00:09.830 --> 06:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
all of the arguments um until just most
 
06:00:09.840 --> 06:00:10.868 align:start position:0%
all of the arguments um until just most
recently

06:00:10.868 --> 06:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
recently
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and so i'm speaking just based on my
 
06:00:16.070 --> 06:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
reading of of the amendment
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
and if i'm reading this correctly mr
 
06:00:19.200 --> 06:00:20.150 align:start position:0%
and if i'm reading this correctly mr
chairman

06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:00:20.160 --> 06:00:20.948 align:start position:0%
chairman
this

06:00:20.948 --> 06:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:00:20.958 --> 06:00:22.788 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
um would establish a very broad
 
06:00:25.520 --> 06:00:26.788 align:start position:0%
um would establish a very broad
prohibition

06:00:26.788 --> 06:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
06:00:29.830 --> 06:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
um against keeping records
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
about against
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
initiating conversations
 
06:00:33.520 --> 06:00:34.390 align:start position:0%
initiating conversations
um

06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:37.270 --> 06:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
about vaccination status
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:43.430 --> 06:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
this seems to me although i'm i'm a
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
practicing doctor i used to practice up
 
06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the north country in a north country
 
06:00:52.230 --> 06:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
conservative community which highly
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
values personal liberty i now currently
 
06:00:56.708 --> 06:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
am working at the va
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not a bureaucrat i'm a practicing
 
06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
doctor and teacher this seems to me
 
06:01:06.070 --> 06:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
so overly broad as to be extremely
 
06:01:06.080 --> 06:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
so overly broad as to be extremely
dangerous

06:01:07.670 --> 06:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
when i practice in that conservative
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
north country community
 
06:01:16.070 --> 06:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
my patients expected me to care for them
 
06:01:19.750 --> 06:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
they expected me to be a professional
 
06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
which means that i would consider their
 
06:01:24.708 --> 06:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
health to be more important than my own
 
06:01:26.948 --> 06:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
personal political beliefs
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
they expected me to advocate for their
 
06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
there's clearly established
 
06:01:34.798 --> 06:01:36.310 align:start position:0%
there's clearly established
appropriateness

06:01:36.310 --> 06:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
appropriateness
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
for schools to require vaccinations
 
06:01:42.788 --> 06:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
there's clearly established
 
06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
law and statute that permits businesses
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
and other institutions
 
06:01:51.590 --> 06:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
to protect their employees and their
 
06:01:51.600 --> 06:01:53.990 align:start position:0%
to protect their employees and their
customers

06:01:53.990 --> 06:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
this amendment as i read it and again
 
06:01:58.628 --> 06:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
with apologies um
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not a a lawyer or a legislator but
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this amendment is so
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
broadly prohibitive
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
um of behaviors that will
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that would let
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
institutions protect their
 
06:02:19.190 --> 06:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
clients their students their customers
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
and their employees as to be extremely
 
06:02:21.600 --> 06:02:22.830 align:start position:0%
and their employees as to be extremely
dangerous

06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
and if i take seriously my role as an
 
06:02:28.788 --> 06:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
advocate for the health of my patients
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
and my community i see this as being
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
very dangerous
 
06:02:34.948 --> 06:02:34.958 align:start position:0%

06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
there i'm representing timothy horrigan
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm from trafford county district six
 
06:03:21.670 --> 06:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for calling on me um traffic
 
06:03:23.190 --> 06:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
county just exists in the towns of
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
durham and madbury
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
durham is not coincidentally the home of
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
unh some which
 
06:03:29.680 --> 06:03:30.470 align:start position:0%
unh some which
had

06:03:30.470 --> 06:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:03:32.868 --> 06:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
a very extensive uh testing program
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
which was far ahead of what was being
 
06:03:35.750 --> 06:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
done in the rest of the state in fact
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's pretty much no program at all
 
06:03:39.990 --> 06:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
early in the pantheon income and they
 
06:03:41.910 --> 06:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
are also ahead of the curve for
 
06:03:43.110 --> 06:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinations even though there's a
 
06:03:45.910 --> 06:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of hiccup when
 
06:03:45.920 --> 06:03:46.948 align:start position:0%
little bit of hiccup when
the

06:03:46.948 --> 06:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
governor decided that they should only
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
be vaccinating students
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
who were residents of new hampshire
 
06:03:53.120 --> 06:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
who were residents of new hampshire
although

06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
although
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
technically they're all residents of new
 
06:03:56.788 --> 06:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire because they're all they've
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
all been here
 
06:04:00.150 --> 06:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
all these months so anyway
 
06:04:02.868 --> 06:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
um this certainly um could have been an
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
especially huge catastrophe in my town
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
with all the uh young people living in
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
close quarters and they did a lot of
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
things um including having a remote
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
classes to ameliorate that but um
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
and it would have been serious even for
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh for for young people uh it has killed
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
some young people and even people who
 
06:04:23.670 --> 06:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
survived have uh
 
06:04:26.868 --> 06:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes very unsettling and uh
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know life
 
06:04:30.230 --> 06:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know life-altering symptoms like for
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
example my uh my nephew who
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
he goes to school bu not a unh but still
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know he still hasn't regained his
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
sense of taste and smell and um you know
 
06:04:41.190 --> 06:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
he's a
 
06:04:42.548 --> 06:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
bit of a foodie so that has been
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
extremely distressing to him so like
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
just the uh
 
06:04:45.760 --> 06:04:46.868 align:start position:0%
just the uh
um

06:04:46.868 --> 06:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
even just saying it's got a 99 survival
 
06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
rate that's still like one out of 100.
 
06:04:52.868 --> 06:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
so i think you know the consequences are
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
aside from death death is not the only
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
bad consequence of this that's a very
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
very serious disease um it's
 
06:05:01.030 --> 06:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
killed just the united states
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
600 000 uh people which makes it the
 
06:05:05.030 --> 06:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
worst catastrophe since the civil war so
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's definitely not a hoax it's
 
06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
definitely um hasn't been exaggerated i
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
guess there's people who think even the
 
06:05:11.670 --> 06:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
civil war was a hoax but that's a
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
besides the point so it's
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
really one of the worst things that ever
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
happened in asia's history so it was
 
06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
even worse than um what we've seen in
 
06:05:22.470 --> 06:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
the media and so and the vaccines
 
06:05:24.230 --> 06:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say they're i'm not
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to say they're they're perfect but
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
they've been effective and um you know
 
06:05:29.910 --> 06:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
like uh i guess what representative
 
06:05:33.430 --> 06:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
cushman mentioned the uh
 
06:05:35.190 --> 06:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
aids epidemic i was living in new york
 
06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
city when the aids epidemic started that
 
06:05:39.030 --> 06:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
was for the episode united states it was
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh not as deadly as kobe it was it was
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
horrible but uh you know covet is
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
you know a magnitude of or worse than
 
06:05:48.470 --> 06:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
anything else we've ever seen and
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
certainly is um
 
06:05:50.718 --> 06:05:51.590 align:start position:0%
certainly is um
uh

06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:53.190 --> 06:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
certainly there's no
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
constitution maybe it may be con there's
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
no constitutional right or human right
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
to affect others you know so there's uh
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease as serious as cova
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's just like um you know if you have
 
06:06:03.680 --> 06:06:05.030 align:start position:0%
that's just like um you know if you have
uh

06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have the right to infect
 
06:06:07.910 --> 06:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody with ebola you know you don't
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
write somebody with with hiv even though
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't um
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
that was not nearly as contagious as
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
coving so that's the idea
 
06:06:18.070 --> 06:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
that somehow there's a constitutional
 
06:06:21.510 --> 06:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
right to infect others is i think a
 
06:06:23.430 --> 06:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
fallacious argument and i'm usually an
 
06:06:25.750 --> 06:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
extremist when it comes to it
 
06:06:27.910 --> 06:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
it comes to liberty and also we already
 
06:06:27.920 --> 06:06:29.110 align:start position:0%
it comes to liberty and also we already
uh

06:06:29.110 --> 06:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
we already have a large number of other
 
06:06:33.510 --> 06:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
health requirements for schools and jobs
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
um you know like uh most many jobs you
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
have to get drug tested um i've had i
 
06:06:40.708 --> 06:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
was a uh
 
06:06:42.150 --> 06:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
i worked in a
 
06:06:43.830 --> 06:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
i worked in public transportation while
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
i had to be uh i myself had to be drug
 
06:06:47.350 --> 06:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
tests and i didn't like it but you know
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
it was not a violation of my human
 
06:06:50.230 --> 06:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
rights so it's not
 
06:06:52.628 --> 06:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
illegal um you have to have tb tests for
 
06:06:54.150 --> 06:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
many jobs you have to have your child
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against very various
 
06:06:57.430 --> 06:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
childhood diseases
 
06:06:59.430 --> 06:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
during the children so this is um
 
06:07:01.590 --> 06:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
basically the same principle
 
06:07:03.910 --> 06:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
the same principle that for for decades
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
has uh
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
has required those types of vaccinations
 
06:07:08.788 --> 06:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
and those types of tests um those type
 
06:07:10.948 --> 06:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
of precautions and also apply here in my
 
06:07:12.310 --> 06:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
opinion and
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
once again i'll repeat
 
06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is one of the worst catastrophes in
 
06:07:17.590 --> 06:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
our nation's history perhaps in world
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
history and uh by the way
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
um i was just in a meeting about vital
 
06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
records a few days ago and
 
06:07:26.548 --> 06:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
this was a 12-month period just ended i
 
06:07:28.230 --> 06:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
believe it was the first time that
 
06:07:29.670 --> 06:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
they've ever recorded that more people
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
died in new hampshire than were born and
 
06:07:32.788 --> 06:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
true in lots of other places and true
 
06:07:36.628 --> 06:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
nationwide and so that's including both
 
06:07:38.150 --> 06:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
the deaths that were coded being
 
06:07:40.150 --> 06:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
directed in covid
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
as well as a
 
06:07:43.830 --> 06:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
death from from from other causes and
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
certainly it's
 
06:07:45.600 --> 06:07:46.310 align:start position:0%
certainly it's
just

06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:07:48.070 --> 06:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
infinitely more serious than many things
 
06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
that were much more worked up into this
 
06:07:51.270 --> 06:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislature it's more dangerous for
 
06:07:52.708 --> 06:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
example than
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats for example so
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:07:59.430 --> 06:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's i think
 
06:08:02.470 --> 06:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
businesses uh and even government i mean
 
06:08:03.670 --> 06:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't like everything the government
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
does but um
 
06:08:06.788 --> 06:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
it's necessary and frankly i've been a
 
06:08:08.708 --> 06:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
legislator for 13 years
 
06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm part of the government it's not
 
06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
something entirely separate from me you
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
know it's uh
 
06:08:14.390 --> 06:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know this is a
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
it's pandemic is it's only been around
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
we've only known about it's only been
 
06:08:20.310 --> 06:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
around for like a little over a year
 
06:08:21.990 --> 06:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's we there's a lot we don't know
 
06:08:23.910 --> 06:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
about it but one thing we do know is
 
06:08:25.350 --> 06:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:08:27.670 --> 06:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
first of all preventative measures such
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
such as mass and so forth work we also
 
06:08:32.310 --> 06:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
know there isn't really
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
that much in the way of effective
 
06:08:35.510 --> 06:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
treatments if you do catch it and also
 
06:08:37.590 --> 06:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
but the vaccines uh yes they're
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
developed basically this is still
 
06:08:40.200 --> 06:08:40.210 align:start position:0%
experimental they actually
 
06:08:40.210 --> 06:08:53.660 align:start position:0%
experimental they actually

rochester new hampshire
 
06:09:47.590 --> 06:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to speak in support
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
of amendment number 11 1443 h back on
 
06:09:55.510 --> 06:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
december i mean i'm sorry april 21st the
 
06:09:58.470 --> 06:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on amendment number 11 40
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
49 in today's testimony much of it has
 
06:10:03.110 --> 06:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
centered around the dangers and the
 
06:10:05.110 --> 06:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the vaccine
 
06:10:07.830 --> 06:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
neither this amendment or amendment 1149
 
06:10:09.990 --> 06:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
addresses that instead they deal with
 
06:10:12.150 --> 06:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
employee employer demands that their
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
employees or that those attending public
 
06:10:17.350 --> 06:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
events receive a vaccine
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
the intent of this amendment is to
 
06:10:21.190 --> 06:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
protect liberty and a person's right to
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
choose without this legislation
 
06:10:25.430 --> 06:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
businesses will be free to exercise
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
authority over people's personal health
 
06:10:29.590 --> 06:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
decisions there may be some reluctance
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
on the part of legislators to interfere
 
06:10:33.910 --> 06:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
with private business decisions but we
 
06:10:36.948 --> 06:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
already do that many ways age sex gender
 
06:10:39.750 --> 06:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
identity race creed color marital status
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%

origin of any person
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
are already protected by government why
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
then should the choice of what a person
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
puts in their body be protected as well
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
our constitutions both federal and state
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
address our right of privacy to move
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
about freely beyond that hipaa laws
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
provide additional privacy rights
 
06:11:02.390 --> 06:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
and ada protects us from discrimination
 
06:11:04.470 --> 06:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
based on medical conditions
 
06:11:06.310 --> 06:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
without the protections afforded by this
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
amendment a person's only recourse their
 
06:11:10.788 --> 06:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
employer mandates that they take this
 
06:11:13.030 --> 06:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
experimental drug is to file suit
 
06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
against their employer should protection
 
06:11:17.590 --> 06:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
from discrimination only be available to
 
06:11:19.830 --> 06:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
people that can afford legal counsel i'd
 
06:11:21.510 --> 06:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
like to add that
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
if someone were to ask about someone's
 
06:11:27.030 --> 06:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh hiv status or whether or not they
 
06:11:29.190 --> 06:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
have hepatitis they would be violating
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the law if an employer did that
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
this vaccination has only received
 
06:11:35.830 --> 06:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
emergency eu thought use authorization
 
06:11:38.788 --> 06:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
by the fda as such it is considered an
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
experimental drug
 
06:11:42.310 --> 06:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
the nuremberg code and this was
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously of permissible
 
06:11:46.948 --> 06:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
medical experiments prohibits compelled
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
use of experimental drug the code in
 
06:11:51.990 --> 06:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
part states that you should be voluntary
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
should be based on successful animal
 
06:11:56.390 --> 06:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
experimentation and should be conducted
 
06:11:59.190 --> 06:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
only by scientifically qualified persons
 
06:12:01.110 --> 06:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
especially when there are alternative
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
treatments available which in this case
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
06:12:06.150 --> 06:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
given these facts people should be able
 
06:12:08.628 --> 06:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
to freely choose or not to take any
 
06:12:10.868 --> 06:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
vaccination that does not have a proven
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
safety record and has not been
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
thoroughly tested and this bill
 
06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
requires that any vaccination that's
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
mandated be thoroughly tested
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
what about people that have had covered
 
06:12:23.670 --> 06:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
and have developed a natural immunity
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i think the two doctors that spoke
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of today's testimony
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
have addressed that are we going to
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and wastefully force them
 
06:12:34.230 --> 06:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
to take the vaccine what harm could come
 
06:12:36.628 --> 06:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
about from taking a vaccination when
 
06:12:38.628 --> 06:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
you've already got an immunity we don't
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
know that
 
06:12:41.910 --> 06:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't let the testimony of the 21st
 
06:12:43.750 --> 06:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
distract you from what's at issue here
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that is the compelled use of a drug
 
06:12:48.150 --> 06:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
possibly unnecessarily through the
 
06:12:50.230 --> 06:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
threat of unemployment and denial of a
 
06:12:51.910 --> 06:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
person's freedom to participate in
 
06:12:55.670 --> 06:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
society and to that point if i spent 30
 
06:12:57.750 --> 06:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
or 40 years in my career and then
 
06:12:59.510 --> 06:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly my employer comes to me and
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
says you have to take this vaccine or
 
06:13:03.990 --> 06:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to be terminated am i to
 
06:13:06.948 --> 06:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
give up my lifelong career because my
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
employer demanded it of me i don't think
 
06:13:11.110 --> 06:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
that would be right
 
06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of talk about
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
so-called vaccine passports the biden
 
06:13:17.590 --> 06:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
administration has been clear will not
 
06:13:20.230 --> 06:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccine passports but what is
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between a government
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
mandate and a private sector mandate in
 
06:13:26.470 --> 06:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
either case your rights have infringed
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
if people's rights are violated it's
 
06:13:30.150 --> 06:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
irrelevant if they are violated by
 
06:13:32.310 --> 06:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
government or industry the fact remains
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
they were violated
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to point out uh something
 
06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
that uh others have said and that is
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
that they they have said in their words
 
06:13:43.280 --> 06:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
that they they have said in their words
that

06:13:44.310 --> 06:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
they don't support
 
06:13:47.910 --> 06:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports but if you read
 
06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
between the lines it's clear that they
 
06:13:49.520 --> 06:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
between the lines it's clear that they
do

06:13:51.510 --> 06:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:13:53.270 --> 06:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
in order to safeguard people's rights of
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
privacy employment and the right to
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
choose i urge the committee to support
 
06:13:59.190 --> 06:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
passage of senate bill 155 with
 
06:14:04.230 --> 06:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
amendment number 1443-h thank you
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
there being none it was good to see you
 
06:14:12.310 --> 06:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your testimony
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
likewise thank you
 
06:14:17.190 --> 06:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh at this point i'm going to call on
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:23.750 --> 06:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for uh letting me
 
06:14:27.030 --> 06:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
testify i'll do my best to be concise so
 
06:14:29.350 --> 06:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
i wrote it down
 
06:14:29.360 --> 06:14:30.230 align:start position:0%
i wrote it down
um

06:14:30.230 --> 06:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:30.240 --> 06:14:31.030 align:start position:0%
um
i

06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:14:33.590 --> 06:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
i am fully in support of this amendment
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
because we need protection from
 
06:14:37.750 --> 06:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination against people who either
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
know they cannot take vaccines
 
06:14:42.390 --> 06:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
or they think they are at risk for
 
06:14:42.400 --> 06:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
or they think they are at risk for
complications

06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
complications
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
there have been scores of double-blind
 
06:14:47.040 --> 06:14:48.310 align:start position:0%
there have been scores of double-blind
placebo

06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
placebo
 
06:14:51.750 --> 06:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
in international clinical trials on
 
06:14:54.150 --> 06:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
thousands of people that prove the
 
06:14:58.948 --> 06:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
efficacy of old proven well-tested safe
 
06:15:01.110 --> 06:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
medication combinations
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
that have treated covet 19 successfully
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
but you probably have never heard of
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
them unless you look them up because for
 
06:15:11.190 --> 06:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
some reason the news media is not
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
interested in them and when they post on
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
things like facebook

06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%

piles

06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
piles
 
06:15:26.150 --> 06:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
of of our mountains as they say of data
 
06:15:29.030 --> 06:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the nih finally decided that they
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
could look at it in january they issued
 
06:15:35.110 --> 06:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
um a neutral position where as they said
 
06:15:37.590 --> 06:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
before they were against it now they put
 
06:15:39.590 --> 06:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
it equal to um
 
06:15:42.390 --> 06:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
the same uh let's see the
 
06:15:42.400 --> 06:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
the same uh let's see the
um

06:15:44.470 --> 06:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
shoot and
 
06:15:48.150 --> 06:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
it escapes me it's what they gave
 
06:15:48.160 --> 06:15:49.190 align:start position:0%
it escapes me it's what they gave
president

06:15:49.190 --> 06:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
president
 
06:15:49.200 --> 06:15:50.470 align:start position:0%
president
uh

06:15:50.470 --> 06:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:15:54.070 --> 06:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
president trump that healed him
 
06:15:56.868 --> 06:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh i think the real issue here
 
06:16:00.150 --> 06:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
is the public health benefits that we're
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're trying to protect
 
06:16:04.070 --> 06:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
everyone the best we can
 
06:16:06.070 --> 06:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
so number one
 
06:16:08.708 --> 06:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
vaccinated people shouldn't have to be
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
worried about being exposed to
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated people
 
06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's that simple
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
if the taking a vaccine protects you
 
06:16:20.708 --> 06:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
then why are you demanding not you but
 
06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
the people who say oh everybody needs to
 
06:16:26.310 --> 06:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
take it that doesn't make sense because
 
06:16:28.628 --> 06:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
if the vaccine protects you then by
 
06:16:30.470 --> 06:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
golly you should be protected and it
 
06:16:32.948 --> 06:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't matter who you're exposed to
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then the other people that you
 
06:16:37.350 --> 06:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
that i do hear people concerned about
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
are the ones i just mentioned people who
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
cannot take a vaccine because they know
 
06:16:45.190 --> 06:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
that it's dangerous for them
 
06:16:47.670 --> 06:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
well it's not just covet they are at
 
06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
risk from
 
06:16:51.750 --> 06:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
if they can't if they if they're if they
 
06:16:54.310 --> 06:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
are immunodeficient
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
there are lots of things that are
 
06:16:59.030 --> 06:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous to them so just everybody
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking a covered vaccine does not mean
 
06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
that they can go out in public and be
 
06:17:07.430 --> 06:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
exposed to everybody
 
06:17:07.440 --> 06:17:08.548 align:start position:0%
exposed to everybody
um

06:17:08.548 --> 06:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:14.708 --> 06:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
the statistical uh evaluation
 
06:17:18.230 --> 06:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
shows that people most at risk for covid
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
are not only elderly
 
06:17:23.670 --> 06:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
and plenty of us fit in there
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
but we
 
06:17:27.030 --> 06:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have comorbidities the people
 
06:17:29.510 --> 06:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
who are at risk are elderly and have
 
06:17:29.520 --> 06:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
who are at risk are elderly and have
comorbidities

06:17:31.750 --> 06:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
comorbidities
 
06:17:31.760 --> 06:17:32.470 align:start position:0%
comorbidities
the

06:17:32.470 --> 06:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
other people who are serious at risk are
 
06:17:35.280 --> 06:17:36.470 align:start position:0%
other people who are serious at risk are
obese

06:17:36.470 --> 06:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
obese
 
06:17:39.110 --> 06:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i just read something that explains
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the factors that contributes to
 
06:17:41.040 --> 06:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
one of the factors that contributes to
that

06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
vitamin d deficiency the research has
 
06:17:48.788 --> 06:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
shown that vitamin d deficiency relates
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
correlates highly with uh susceptibility
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
to covid
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
and the more fat somebody sells somebody
 
06:18:00.070 --> 06:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
has the d that they have taken in is
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
diluted throughout their body so the
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
more the more fat cells you need more d
 
06:18:08.230 --> 06:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
to get the level up in your bloodstream
 
06:18:11.110 --> 06:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
that's where it fights the disease and
 
06:18:12.948 --> 06:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
some doctors are really good now about
 
06:18:16.868 --> 06:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
testing serum d3 levels but others have
 
06:18:19.430 --> 06:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
we have doctors we need to remind but
 
06:18:21.990 --> 06:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
they used to say 30 nanograms per
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
milliliter was high normal
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
what they found now
 
06:18:29.190 --> 06:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
a hundred is high normal and the people
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
who measure 65 and above
 
06:18:35.590 --> 06:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
not only have a much
 
06:18:37.590 --> 06:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
either they don't get coveted at all or
 
06:18:39.750 --> 06:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
they get very mild cases
 
06:18:42.390 --> 06:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
and as a side benefit the incidence of
 
06:18:46.150 --> 06:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
breast cancer is reduced by 87
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
so that's something you know that would
 
06:18:50.470 --> 06:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
be wonderful to hear more research i
 
06:18:52.548 --> 06:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
wish the government would pay for that
 
06:18:55.510 --> 06:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
because d3 is super cheap and extremely
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to get in our in our
 
06:18:58.080 --> 06:18:59.190 align:start position:0%
difficult to get in our in our
diet

06:18:59.190 --> 06:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
diet
 
06:19:01.590 --> 06:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
you take those little pills fortunately
 
06:19:02.948 --> 06:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
they're pretty small
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
and they're inexpensive and available
 
06:19:06.718 --> 06:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
and they're inexpensive and available
um

06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:10.868 --> 06:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
the clinical trials
 
06:19:13.590 --> 06:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately are being
 
06:19:15.430 --> 06:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
i already said that they've already been
 
06:19:17.430 --> 06:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
suppressed so you really have to look at
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
them two of the organizations that have
 
06:19:23.190 --> 06:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
real good data are the flccc which is
 
06:19:26.548 --> 06:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
frontline coving critical care they have
 
06:19:26.558 --> 06:19:27.750 align:start position:0%
frontline coving critical care they have
done

06:19:27.750 --> 06:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:19:30.548 --> 06:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
enormous numbers of clinical trials one
 
06:19:34.070 --> 06:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the most impressive was the one in
 
06:19:36.230 --> 06:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
in south america
 
06:19:37.750 --> 06:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
where they tested
 
06:19:38.868 --> 06:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
they gave
 
06:19:41.510 --> 06:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
12 1200 health care workers were
 
06:19:41.520 --> 06:19:42.548 align:start position:0%
12 1200 health care workers were
involved

06:19:42.548 --> 06:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:19:44.788 --> 06:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
and 400 of them
 
06:19:46.470 --> 06:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
got the placebo
 
06:19:48.628 --> 06:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
and 800 of them
 
06:19:52.310 --> 06:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
got the ivermectin combined with another
 
06:19:56.628 --> 06:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
another drug the results were astounding
 
06:19:59.670 --> 06:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the 400 people who got the uh the
 
06:19:59.680 --> 06:20:01.030 align:start position:0%
of the 400 people who got the uh the
placebo

06:20:01.030 --> 06:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
placebo
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
58 of them tested positive or got sick
 
06:20:09.030 --> 06:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the 800 who got the preventive
 
06:20:11.350 --> 06:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
nobody got sick
 
06:20:13.190 --> 06:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's pretty impressive
 
06:20:15.430 --> 06:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
so the old fear that if you don't take a
 
06:20:17.670 --> 06:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine you have no treatment you're at
 
06:20:20.390 --> 06:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
risk for death is wrong
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is look for it
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
and go down your pharmacy that's what
 
06:20:26.708 --> 06:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
i'm doing i'm taking the vitamin d but
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'm taking a whole lot of the vitamins
 
06:20:32.070 --> 06:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
that are recommended by the flccc
 
06:20:34.788 --> 06:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
so again i think oh that bears data
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
somebody questioned
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
the vares data i'm sorry my
 
06:20:41.270 --> 06:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
my internet apparently was playing
 
06:20:44.470 --> 06:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
little little games uh the vares which
 
06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
stands for vaccine adverse event
 
06:20:48.868 --> 06:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
reporting system which has been around
 
06:20:51.270 --> 06:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
for a long time but a lot of times
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
people don't report that they have a
 
06:20:55.990 --> 06:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine response or they the doctors
 
06:20:58.310 --> 06:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
just say of course that's normal but the
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
doctors have to report deaths so the
 
06:21:04.548 --> 06:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
number of deaths in which the cdc says
 
06:21:07.190 --> 06:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
they think they're under reported
 
06:21:09.990 --> 06:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's well over 4 000 people have died
 
06:21:11.990 --> 06:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
and even if that's a low percentage
 
06:21:14.310 --> 06:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
compared to the millions of people who
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
have taken the vaccines
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
if it happens to you or your family
 
06:21:22.150 --> 06:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred percent
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
so please protect protect me from
 
06:21:28.070 --> 06:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination do not do not keep me
 
06:21:30.788 --> 06:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
from being able to travel or to go and
 
06:21:33.350 --> 06:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
stay at a restaurant go to a restaurant
 
06:21:35.510 --> 06:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
or stay in a hotel
 
06:21:37.750 --> 06:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm protecting myself and if you've had
 
06:21:40.230 --> 06:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
your vaccine you really should not be at

can you hear me
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%

it'll protect my rights
 
06:22:46.868 --> 06:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
i want i've heard a lot of science today
 
06:22:48.628 --> 06:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
so forgive me i want to bring up one
 
06:22:50.310 --> 06:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
more little tiny piece of science that i
 
06:22:52.150 --> 06:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
think everybody should hear
 
06:22:53.910 --> 06:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the germ theory of disease
 
06:22:56.470 --> 06:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
versus the terrain theory of disease
 
06:22:58.390 --> 06:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
the germ theory of disease is what all
 
06:23:00.390 --> 06:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are based on and it has
 
06:23:03.110 --> 06:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
never been proven never not even for one
 
06:23:03.120 --> 06:23:04.310 align:start position:0%
never been proven never not even for one
disease

06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
disease
 
06:23:06.708 --> 06:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
it is it is nonsense
 
06:23:08.548 --> 06:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
the terrain theory of disease is the
 
06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
correct theory of disease and that says
 
06:23:13.030 --> 06:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
that disease is caused by a buildup of
 
06:23:15.350 --> 06:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
toxins in the body and or a lack of
 
06:23:15.360 --> 06:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
toxins in the body and or a lack of
nutrition

06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
nutrition
 
06:23:19.590 --> 06:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
nutrition also helps you to remove
 
06:23:21.510 --> 06:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
toxins from the body things like vitamin
 
06:23:21.520 --> 06:23:22.548 align:start position:0%
toxins from the body things like vitamin
c

06:23:22.548 --> 06:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
c
 
06:23:24.868 --> 06:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
i also heard some discussion today about
 
06:23:26.470 --> 06:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
some diseases so let me tell you the
 
06:23:29.190 --> 06:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
truth about them spanish flu
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
was not caused by any infectious agent
 
06:23:34.150 --> 06:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
no virus no bacteria caused the spanish
 
06:23:34.160 --> 06:23:35.350 align:start position:0%
no virus no bacteria caused the spanish
flu

06:23:35.350 --> 06:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
flu
 
06:23:37.830 --> 06:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
doctors used hundreds of volunteers back
 
06:23:40.948 --> 06:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
then and tried to infect them
 
06:23:43.270 --> 06:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
with material from from cadavers who had
 
06:23:45.110 --> 06:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
died from the spanish flu they were
 
06:23:47.350 --> 06:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
unable to get anybody sick
 
06:23:50.150 --> 06:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
they also had sick animals like horses
 
06:23:52.310 --> 06:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
that died they tried to infect healthy
 
06:23:55.190 --> 06:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
horses they could not
 
06:23:56.788 --> 06:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
so yeah a lot of people died from the
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
spanish flu but it was not caused by any
 
06:24:01.990 --> 06:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
infectious agent so down goes with the
 
06:24:03.590 --> 06:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
germ theory there
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
one of the things that killed people
 
06:24:06.948 --> 06:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
during the spanish flu was the vaccines
 
06:24:10.310 --> 06:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
they had for it and also an extreme
 
06:24:13.190 --> 06:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
overdose of aspirin a lot of people were
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
bleeding to death we now know that
 
06:24:18.150 --> 06:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
aspirin causes bleeding
 
06:24:20.470 --> 06:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
so that was the spanish flu polio is
 
06:24:23.190 --> 06:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
another nonsense uh virus
 
06:24:26.470 --> 06:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
polio is actually caused by ddt
 
06:24:26.480 --> 06:24:27.670 align:start position:0%
polio is actually caused by ddt
uh

06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:29.270 --> 06:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
this fear of uh
 
06:24:31.590 --> 06:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
these mosquitoes caused ddt being
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
sprayed all over the place and some
 
06:24:35.830 --> 06:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
people could detox it some could not
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
those who could not got nerve damage and
 
06:24:39.910 --> 06:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
they got paralysis
 
06:24:41.990 --> 06:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that was polio and they called that
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
from a virus that was nonsense
 
06:24:47.510 --> 06:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh aids is another fake virus the
 
06:24:47.520 --> 06:24:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh aids is another fake virus the
inventor

06:24:49.190 --> 06:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
inventor
 
06:24:51.510 --> 06:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
of carrie mullis the inventor of the pcr
 
06:24:53.110 --> 06:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
test and by the way carrie mueller said
 
06:24:55.430 --> 06:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
you can't use his pcr test to diagnose
 
06:24:57.190 --> 06:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
any disease
 
06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
well they're using it to diagnose
 
06:25:01.030 --> 06:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
diagnose covid
 
06:25:02.868 --> 06:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's how they they've created this
 
06:25:04.788 --> 06:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
what i call scandemic with all these
 
06:25:08.628 --> 06:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
cases cases mostly of healthy people
 
06:25:11.270 --> 06:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
could you possibly
 
06:25:13.990 --> 06:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
limit your testimony to the bill and not
 
06:25:15.510 --> 06:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
to actual
 
06:25:17.670 --> 06:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
theories on science on past viruses
 
06:25:17.680 --> 06:25:19.110 align:start position:0%
theories on science on past viruses
please

06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
well okay but everybody else was talking
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
science so i figured i could i could
 
06:25:23.830 --> 06:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
bring up some of these things to tell
 
06:25:25.190 --> 06:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
the truth about the other things that
 
06:25:26.470 --> 06:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
people were talking about that other
 
06:25:28.470 --> 06:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
people mentioned polio and
 
06:25:30.708 --> 06:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
spanish flu etc as far as the bill is
 
06:25:30.718 --> 06:25:32.150 align:start position:0%
spanish flu etc as far as the bill is
concerned

06:25:32.150 --> 06:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
06:25:34.310 --> 06:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
i don't believe in the in the germ
 
06:25:36.310 --> 06:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
theory of disease i will not take any
 
06:25:38.708 --> 06:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine i don't belong to that church of
 
06:25:38.718 --> 06:25:39.470 align:start position:0%
vaccine i don't belong to that church of
uh

06:25:39.470 --> 06:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:41.830 --> 06:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
vaccineology i don't want to be forced
 
06:25:44.070 --> 06:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
to join that church
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i hope you people will protect my
 
06:25:48.390 --> 06:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
rights i moved to new hampshire in 2012
 
06:25:50.070 --> 06:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
because it was the free estate on the
 
06:25:51.750 --> 06:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
east coast
 
06:25:53.430 --> 06:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i hope i don't have to move out of
 
06:25:55.750 --> 06:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but if i can't travel and
 
06:25:57.750 --> 06:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
i can't shop and i can't live a normal
 
06:25:58.948 --> 06:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
life then i'm going to have to go to
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
florida or texas or somewhere
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:07.510 --> 06:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
protected thank you

raise your hand i know some people have
 
06:26:22.948 --> 06:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
signed up but they're no longer with us
 
06:26:24.548 --> 06:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
in the room so
 
06:26:26.310 --> 06:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if you raise your
 
06:26:28.708 --> 06:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
hand so we're going to go with

hampshire
 
06:27:18.230 --> 06:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
and um i mostly want to just echo a lot
 
06:27:21.270 --> 06:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
of things that were said by dr sherman
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
dr marsh
 
06:27:24.708 --> 06:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:27:27.510 --> 06:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes i'm name blocking at the moment um
 
06:27:29.110 --> 06:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
the head of the bureau of infectious
 
06:27:29.120 --> 06:27:30.150 align:start position:0%
the head of the bureau of infectious
disease

06:27:30.150 --> 06:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
disease
 
06:27:33.990 --> 06:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
um the they're all entirely correct but
 
06:27:36.230 --> 06:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
i wanted to just emphasize some things
 
06:27:38.150 --> 06:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
number one um
 
06:27:40.070 --> 06:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
we are talking about
 
06:27:41.750 --> 06:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment not the one that you
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
heard three weeks ago that was specific
 
06:27:46.948 --> 06:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
to code but and this is a really um
 
06:27:46.958 --> 06:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
to code but and this is a really um
terrible

06:27:48.070 --> 06:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
idea to try to say that all vaccines
 
06:27:54.390 --> 06:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
can be um
 
06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
a source of
 
06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
someone discriminated against
 
06:28:00.628 --> 06:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
another person for failing to get
 
06:28:03.110 --> 06:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's well
 
06:28:05.590 --> 06:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
well established in law including
 
06:28:07.590 --> 06:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision
 
06:28:10.628 --> 06:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
that infectious diseases there can be
 
06:28:10.638 --> 06:28:12.468 align:start position:0%
that infectious diseases there can be
requirements

06:28:12.468 --> 06:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:28:12.478 --> 06:28:13.270 align:start position:0%
requirements
and

06:28:13.270 --> 06:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:15.190 --> 06:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
i think this whole issue around
 
06:28:17.750 --> 06:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
employment is an extremely important one
 
06:28:19.670 --> 06:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
06:28:22.628 --> 06:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
this amendment states that
 
06:28:24.548 --> 06:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
it would have to be a direct threat well
 
06:28:27.430 --> 06:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
how do you assess a direct threat of
 
06:28:30.628 --> 06:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
aerosol transmitted disease which has
 
06:28:33.270 --> 06:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic spread that is people who
 
06:28:34.468 --> 06:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
have not
 
06:28:36.788 --> 06:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
got symptoms are spreading it and that's
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
true of covid which isn't even mentioned
 
06:28:40.390 --> 06:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
in this amendment
 
06:28:42.468 --> 06:28:42.478 align:start position:0%
it's true of a number of other diseases
 
06:28:44.468 --> 06:28:44.478 align:start position:0%
and things that we are very thankful we
 
06:28:46.708 --> 06:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
have good vaccines for
 
06:28:46.718 --> 06:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
have good vaccines for
and

06:28:47.590 --> 06:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
i have in my own experience seeing
 
06:28:50.400 --> 06:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
i have in my own experience seeing
a

06:28:51.350 --> 06:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
baby with german measles terribly
 
06:28:54.240 --> 06:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
baby with german measles terribly
afflicted

06:28:55.830 --> 06:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
afflicted
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
that's just really unnecessary and if
 
06:29:00.390 --> 06:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
you say an employer
 
06:29:02.310 --> 06:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
can't require
 
06:29:02.320 --> 06:29:03.270 align:start position:0%
can't require
that

06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:06.468 --> 06:29:06.478 align:start position:0%
a child care place or any place that a
 
06:29:08.548 --> 06:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman might
 
06:29:09.750 --> 06:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
end up
 
06:29:11.990 --> 06:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
can't require that i mean
 
06:29:14.468 --> 06:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
that that's ridiculous so
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
we we did in fact at the time i was
 
06:29:19.590 --> 06:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
going through training require anyone
 
06:29:21.750 --> 06:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
who worked in our hospitals
 
06:29:24.788 --> 06:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
to have german measles vaccine or
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
immunity proven
 
06:29:26.400 --> 06:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
immunity proven
by

06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:29:29.110 --> 06:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
um blood tests
 
06:29:31.350 --> 06:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of thing we need and
 
06:29:33.030 --> 06:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
06:29:35.830 --> 06:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
we found out about 40 years ago after a
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
debacle from bad science where someone
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
invented their data
 
06:29:43.910 --> 06:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
and got a whole lot of people to stop
 
06:29:45.750 --> 06:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
immunizing their children against
 
06:29:47.910 --> 06:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
whooping cough that whooping cough
 
06:29:50.548 --> 06:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
actually is transmitted regularly among
 
06:29:52.070 --> 06:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
adults it just doesn't look like
 
06:29:53.430 --> 06:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
whooping cough it looks like any
 
06:29:55.270 --> 06:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
ordinary bronchitis
 
06:29:57.670 --> 06:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
and so it gets reintroduced immediately
 
06:29:59.910 --> 06:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
into pediatric populations some of the
 
06:30:01.830 --> 06:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
children would die
 
06:30:01.840 --> 06:30:02.548 align:start position:0%
children would die
so

06:30:02.548 --> 06:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know this is not an easy thing and i
 
06:30:07.110 --> 06:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to just
 
06:30:09.030 --> 06:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
quickly state that there is a
 
06:30:11.990 --> 06:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about the vares system
 
06:30:14.468 --> 06:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
the vaccine advance adverse event
 
06:30:16.468 --> 06:30:16.478 align:start position:0%
reporting system
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
you are reporting stuff that has not
 
06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
been proven to be
 
06:30:23.230 --> 06:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine and a lot of
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
coincidental things are happening
 
06:30:28.468 --> 06:30:28.478 align:start position:0%
after people receive vaccine
 
06:30:30.788 --> 06:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
and unless you have done a placebo
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
control you don't know
 
06:30:34.948 --> 06:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
and actually placebo-controlled trials
 
06:30:37.510 --> 06:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
on the influenza vaccine have been done
 
06:30:39.430 --> 06:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
and shown that all of these people who
 
06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
say oh influenza vaccine gives me
 
06:30:44.948 --> 06:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
influenza i can't take it are incorrect
 
06:30:47.430 --> 06:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
because the rate of adverse events from
 
06:30:50.390 --> 06:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine is identical to a
 
06:30:52.708 --> 06:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
saline injection salt water injection
 
06:30:54.548 --> 06:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
except for sore arm
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the sore arm is expected
 
06:30:57.120 --> 06:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
and the sore arm is expected
so

06:30:57.990 --> 06:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about the vares reports
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
of 4000 deaths after covid19 vaccine
 
06:31:05.990 --> 06:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
that indicates the copenhagen vaccine
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
has killed anyone we do know that the
 
06:31:11.990 --> 06:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
astrazeneca and the j j vaccine have
 
06:31:15.990 --> 06:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
triggered some immune thrombocytopenic
 
06:31:16.000 --> 06:31:17.030 align:start position:0%
triggered some immune thrombocytopenic
um

06:31:17.030 --> 06:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:17.040 --> 06:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
um
bleeding

06:31:18.150 --> 06:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
bleeding
 
06:31:20.868 --> 06:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
and it's really that's terrible but it's
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily rare and the vaccines
 
06:31:24.868 --> 06:31:24.878 align:start position:0%
that have mostly been used in this
 
06:31:27.990 --> 06:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
country the pfizer and the moderna have
 
06:31:30.230 --> 06:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
not triggered any such things and
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's only rare immune reactions and
 
06:31:34.948 --> 06:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
most of them have been successfully
 
06:31:34.958 --> 06:31:36.390 align:start position:0%
most of them have been successfully
treated

06:31:36.390 --> 06:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
treated
 
06:31:36.400 --> 06:31:37.670 align:start position:0%
treated
um

06:31:37.670 --> 06:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:37.680 --> 06:31:38.548 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:31:38.548 --> 06:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:41.670 --> 06:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
i i think all in all this this bill
 
06:31:43.190 --> 06:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
number one doesn't address covert
 
06:31:45.110 --> 06:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
directly and it would have all kinds of
 
06:31:46.830 --> 06:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
negative effects that dr
 
06:31:49.750 --> 06:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
daly spoke to you about
 
06:31:52.868 --> 06:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
and i would just also reiterate that
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines are not a hundred percent
 
06:31:58.708 --> 06:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
so that if we allow
 
06:32:03.670 --> 06:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't want people to be
 
06:32:05.590 --> 06:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
forced to vaccinate to
 
06:32:08.948 --> 06:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
work in certain places they will infect
 
06:32:10.310 --> 06:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
other people
 
06:32:11.350 --> 06:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
if they
 
06:32:13.750 --> 06:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
get the disease and pass it on whether
 
06:32:15.910 --> 06:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're symptomatic or not which is
 
06:32:17.910 --> 06:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
definitely the case with a number of
 
06:32:20.708 --> 06:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
diseases including covet 19
 
06:32:22.628 --> 06:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
and those other people might have had
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
their vaccines and they might be very
 
06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
susceptible and yes there are treatments
 
06:32:30.788 --> 06:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
that help but they don't 100 percent
 
06:32:32.230 --> 06:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
prevent death
 
06:32:34.230 --> 06:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
or serious illness
 
06:32:37.350 --> 06:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i think we're making great progress
 
06:32:39.990 --> 06:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
it correlates well with the vaccine to
 
06:32:40.000 --> 06:32:40.868 align:start position:0%
it correlates well with the vaccine to
uh

06:32:40.868 --> 06:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
put a a quite
 
06:32:43.200 --> 06:32:44.708 align:start position:0%
put a a quite
definite

06:32:44.708 --> 06:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
definite
 
06:32:46.868 --> 06:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
you're listening to fake science when
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
people tell you the vaccine doesn't work
 
06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:32:54.548 --> 06:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
drop in infections here has been largely
 
06:32:58.628 --> 06:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
correlated with the extension of vaccine
 
06:33:00.868 --> 06:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
and we don't have anywhere near enough
 
06:33:03.670 --> 06:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
natural infection to think that's the
 
06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason and i would also point out that
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
there have been no reports
 
06:33:08.080 --> 06:33:08.948 align:start position:0%
there have been no reports
yet

06:33:08.948 --> 06:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
that getting the vaccine after having
 
06:33:14.230 --> 06:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
had natural infection causes problems
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't really expect there will be
 
06:33:19.510 --> 06:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
and in point of fact there is some
 
06:33:19.520 --> 06:33:20.548 align:start position:0%
and in point of fact there is some
evidence

06:33:20.548 --> 06:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
that you will have improved immunity
 
06:33:24.830 --> 06:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
against reinfection if you get
 
06:33:27.830 --> 06:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated despite having had covert 19
 
06:33:27.840 --> 06:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
vaccinated despite having had covert 19
before

06:33:29.350 --> 06:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:33:30.868 --> 06:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
i think i've talked enough if you have
 
06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
any questions i'd be happy to answer
 
06:33:32.400 --> 06:33:34.628 align:start position:0%
any questions i'd be happy to answer
them

06:33:34.628 --> 06:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:33:37.910 --> 06:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:39.430 --> 06:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:33:43.030 --> 06:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh dr uh i wonder whether
 
06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
you could address the question that i
 
06:33:46.548 --> 06:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
asked of
 
06:33:46.558 --> 06:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
asked of
um

06:33:47.830 --> 06:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:47.840 --> 06:33:48.868 align:start position:0%
um
of

06:33:48.868 --> 06:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:33:51.670 --> 06:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
dr sherman i believe with regard to the
 
06:33:51.680 --> 06:33:52.708 align:start position:0%
dr sherman i believe with regard to the
uh

06:33:52.708 --> 06:33:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:33:55.830 --> 06:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
maybe with dr marsh with regard to the
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
development of mutations that are
 
06:33:58.320 --> 06:33:59.270 align:start position:0%
development of mutations that are
already

06:33:59.270 --> 06:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to be rapidly spreading
 
06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh and to have some significant
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
differences in characteristics in terms
 
06:34:09.270 --> 06:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
of contagiousness
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
and also lethality uh and with the
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
population of india being a billion 300
 
06:34:17.670 --> 06:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
million people and the disease is
 
06:34:20.548 --> 06:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
running wild there uh
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
are you fearful of the implications of a
 
06:34:25.990 --> 06:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
of a more
 
06:34:26.000 --> 06:34:27.270 align:start position:0%
of a more
dangerous

06:34:27.270 --> 06:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh variant
 
06:34:31.830 --> 06:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
rapidly spreading in the united states
 
06:34:33.350 --> 06:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
if we don't have enough people
 
06:34:33.360 --> 06:34:35.510 align:start position:0%
if we don't have enough people
vaccinated

06:34:35.510 --> 06:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
06:34:37.830 --> 06:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah i think that's a legitimate
 
06:34:40.390 --> 06:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
concern i don't think we know i mean
 
06:34:40.400 --> 06:34:41.270 align:start position:0%
concern i don't think we know i mean
yes

06:34:41.270 --> 06:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:34:44.468 --> 06:34:44.478 align:start position:0%
all viruses mutate some more readily
 
06:34:47.270 --> 06:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
than others and sometimes that allows
 
06:34:49.270 --> 06:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
them to escape immune surveillance but
 
06:34:50.788 --> 06:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always
 
06:34:50.798 --> 06:34:51.590 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always
and

06:34:51.590 --> 06:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
in point of fact it may well be that we
 
06:34:57.110 --> 06:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
already have the most infectious one
 
06:34:58.708 --> 06:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have we have the uk
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
variant now predominantly and the uk
 
06:35:03.910 --> 06:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
variant is more infectious it does not
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
seem to be causing more
 
06:35:07.830 --> 06:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
severe illness
 
06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
it does in fact
 
06:35:12.150 --> 06:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
have good coverage by both of our
 
06:35:15.430 --> 06:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
well even by the jnj vaccine but pfizer
 
06:35:17.750 --> 06:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
and modern are definitely have good
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
coverage for that now will something
 
06:35:21.750 --> 06:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
come back into our population that we
 
06:35:23.670 --> 06:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
have less good coverage or dr sherman
 
06:35:25.350 --> 06:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
did address that
 
06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i think he's correct that it could
 
06:35:29.430 --> 06:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
happen and we may end up needing a
 
06:35:31.990 --> 06:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
booster if that happens but i don't
 
06:35:33.430 --> 06:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
think that's something where we
 
06:35:35.830 --> 06:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily will see that happen the
 
06:35:39.270 --> 06:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
south africa variant um unfortunately
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
the astrazeneca which they were using
 
06:35:45.110 --> 06:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
widely um was not actually effective
 
06:35:48.628 --> 06:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
enough um so that became a real problem
 
06:35:51.510 --> 06:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
will something become that bad here it
 
06:35:55.510 --> 06:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
could i hope not i i'm pretty old myself
 
06:35:57.750 --> 06:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know i've been pretty locked
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
down for most of a year plus and
 
06:36:03.430 --> 06:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
now that i'm vaccinated i'm
 
06:36:05.590 --> 06:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
enjoying life a little more now thank
 
06:36:05.600 --> 06:36:06.390 align:start position:0%
enjoying life a little more now thank
you

06:36:06.390 --> 06:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:36:09.510 --> 06:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up question mr chairman uh what
 
06:36:12.628 --> 06:36:12.638 align:start position:0%
about the long-haul phenomenon that is
 
06:36:14.788 --> 06:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh that we're learning more about people
 
06:36:17.190 --> 06:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
who are losing their sense of taste and
 
06:36:19.430 --> 06:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
smell as an example
 
06:36:19.440 --> 06:36:20.948 align:start position:0%
smell as an example
and

06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
they say if you don't get it back
 
06:36:24.150 --> 06:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly
 
06:36:25.670 --> 06:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
you probably won't get your taste to
 
06:36:29.430 --> 06:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
smell back a taste and smell back and
 
06:36:31.430 --> 06:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a terrible thing for a
 
06:36:33.270 --> 06:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
person to go through their lives and
 
06:36:35.670 --> 06:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous as well with no sense of taste
 
06:36:37.670 --> 06:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
or smell
 
06:36:39.430 --> 06:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
i i think there are other other long
 
06:36:42.708 --> 06:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
hauler phenomena as well i think those
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
are serious issues and and you know i
 
06:36:46.468 --> 06:36:46.478 align:start position:0%
think there are other long-haul kinds of
 
06:36:48.548 --> 06:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
things that some people are developing
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
chronic fatigue type symptoms um which
 
06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
may or may not be due to some other
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
viruses we've never recognized maybe a
 
06:36:59.270 --> 06:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
covet virus that we i mean another
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
coronavirus a covet um
 
06:37:02.958 --> 06:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
coronavirus a covet um
and

06:37:03.750 --> 06:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:37:06.070 --> 06:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's just it's something that would be
 
06:37:08.628 --> 06:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
wonderful to prevent and
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know maybe more people wearing masks
 
06:37:12.788 --> 06:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
all winter
 
06:37:15.350 --> 06:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
when more respiratory viruses are spread
 
06:37:17.350 --> 06:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
because we're confined indoors with each
 
06:37:19.430 --> 06:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
other might be a good thing in the long
 
06:37:21.030 --> 06:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
run so we might have learned something
 
06:37:23.350 --> 06:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
great about reducing the spread of
 
06:37:24.468 --> 06:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
things that
 
06:37:26.468 --> 06:37:26.478 align:start position:0%
we didn't even know were causing such
 
06:37:28.548 --> 06:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
serious problems for a small percentage
 
06:37:29.990 --> 06:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
of people
 
06:37:32.070 --> 06:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you doctor thank you
 
06:37:35.190 --> 06:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:51.270 --> 06:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:53.590 --> 06:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me chairman
 
06:37:53.600 --> 06:37:54.628 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me chairman
yes

06:37:54.628 --> 06:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:37:56.708 --> 06:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you for taking my
 
06:37:59.430 --> 06:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is linda ray camarota
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
from bedford new hampshire
 
06:38:06.310 --> 06:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm a registered nurse i have children
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
that have been vaccinated
 
06:38:08.878 --> 06:38:10.070 align:start position:0%
that have been vaccinated
um

06:38:10.070 --> 06:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
i want i'm responding to amendment 1468
 
06:38:14.878 --> 06:38:16.230 align:start position:0%
i want i'm responding to amendment 1468
h

06:38:16.230 --> 06:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
h
 
06:38:17.990 --> 06:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i just want to
 
06:38:20.788 --> 06:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
put in a couple of comments with regard
 
06:38:23.270 --> 06:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
to what i've heard this afternoon
 
06:38:23.280 --> 06:38:25.110 align:start position:0%
to what i've heard this afternoon
um

06:38:25.110 --> 06:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:27.510 --> 06:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reps wanted to know what it
 
06:38:30.628 --> 06:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
might cost to have antibody tests done i
 
06:38:33.110 --> 06:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
happen to have one done and it was ten
 
06:38:35.190 --> 06:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
dollars cost me ten dollars out of
 
06:38:35.200 --> 06:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
dollars cost me ten dollars out of
pocket

06:38:37.750 --> 06:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:37.760 --> 06:38:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
childhood

06:38:39.190 --> 06:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
childhood
 
06:38:39.200 --> 06:38:40.948 align:start position:0%
childhood
vaccinations

06:38:40.948 --> 06:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
06:38:43.190 --> 06:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
are mandated in the state of new
 
06:38:43.200 --> 06:38:44.788 align:start position:0%
are mandated in the state of new
hampshire

06:38:44.788 --> 06:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:38:48.310 --> 06:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
because they have been fda approved
 
06:38:50.628 --> 06:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about today what i'm
 
06:38:53.990 --> 06:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking about today is as it relates to
 
06:38:54.000 --> 06:38:55.030 align:start position:0%
talking about today is as it relates to
the

06:38:55.030 --> 06:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:38:55.040 --> 06:38:57.110 align:start position:0%
the
coronavirus

06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
coronavirus
 
06:39:00.628 --> 06:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine it should be understood that
 
06:39:02.468 --> 06:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
it's experimental
 
06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
and because it's experimental
 
06:39:07.430 --> 06:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is one of my strongest positions that
 
06:39:09.990 --> 06:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
it should not be mandated if it got to
 
06:39:11.830 --> 06:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
the point where the fda did what it
 
06:39:14.150 --> 06:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
normally does when it's not under
 
06:39:16.708 --> 06:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization use
 
06:39:16.718 --> 06:39:18.070 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization use
then

06:39:18.070 --> 06:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:39:20.070 --> 06:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know we couldn't come back to the
 
06:39:22.310 --> 06:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
drawing table
 
06:39:25.270 --> 06:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
somebody also said that
 
06:39:27.030 --> 06:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of the doctors that testified
 
06:39:29.030 --> 06:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
earlier was
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
not um really his credentials were not
 
06:39:34.468 --> 06:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
up to speed but he did state he's an
 
06:39:37.670 --> 06:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
immunologist so i put value into his
 
06:39:37.680 --> 06:39:39.910 align:start position:0%
immunologist so i put value into his
testimony

06:39:39.910 --> 06:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:39:42.948 --> 06:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
and last i haven't read my testimony but
 
06:39:45.990 --> 06:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
on page two of
 
06:39:48.150 --> 06:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:39:48.160 --> 06:39:49.270 align:start position:0%
the amendment
section

06:39:49.270 --> 06:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:39:49.280 --> 06:39:50.548 align:start position:0%
section
12

06:39:50.548 --> 06:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
12
 
06:39:54.150 --> 06:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
clearly states that all parents and
 
06:39:58.788 --> 06:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
legal guardians shall
 
06:40:00.788 --> 06:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
have their children who are residing in
 
06:40:02.948 --> 06:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
the state immunized against certain
 
06:40:05.670 --> 06:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
diseases so i don't see anything in here
 
06:40:05.680 --> 06:40:07.110 align:start position:0%
diseases so i don't see anything in here
that

06:40:07.110 --> 06:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:40:07.120 --> 06:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
that
creates

06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
creates
 
06:40:10.310 --> 06:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
a dangerous situation
 
06:40:12.628 --> 06:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
for our children
 
06:40:14.788 --> 06:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
so testimony come before you today in
 
06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
full support of this amendment
 
06:40:18.948 --> 06:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
the past 14 months have turned our
 
06:40:21.510 --> 06:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
worlds upside down and we now have the
 
06:40:23.910 --> 06:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reflect on the actions
 
06:40:26.150 --> 06:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
taken in attempt to mitigate the impact
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic many actions resulted in
 
06:40:31.670 --> 06:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
positive outcomes here in new hampshire
 
06:40:34.150 --> 06:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
and some will have unintended
 
06:40:37.270 --> 06:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
consequences it's much too early to
 
06:40:40.070 --> 06:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
see what the future holds for us the
 
06:40:42.150 --> 06:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
learning curve has been significant and
 
06:40:45.030 --> 06:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
now we're here to rebalance our families
 
06:40:47.590 --> 06:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
communities and the state i want to
 
06:40:50.390 --> 06:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
address three areas of utmost concern as
 
06:40:52.628 --> 06:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
it relates to this amendment
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
one is we heard a little bit about human
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
rights and discrimination
 
06:40:59.270 --> 06:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
and as it relates to the experimental
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
nature of this injection
 
06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
um no emergency authorized medical
 
06:41:07.350 --> 06:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
product i'm talking about the vaccine
 
06:41:09.510 --> 06:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
that people call a vaccine i call it an
 
06:41:13.030 --> 06:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
injection can be mandated under 21 us
 
06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
code section 360.
 
06:41:18.468 --> 06:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
as an astute observer and researcher of
 
06:41:21.670 --> 06:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
this entire matter of the pandemic it is
 
06:41:23.590 --> 06:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
understood that the fda has not
 
06:41:25.350 --> 06:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
officially approved it it is only
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
authorized under this emergency
 
06:41:29.510 --> 06:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
authorization and i do believe that
 
06:41:32.390 --> 06:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization as a
 
06:41:32.400 --> 06:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
emergency authorization as a
country

06:41:33.430 --> 06:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:41:35.430 --> 06:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
should soon
 
06:41:35.440 --> 06:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
should soon
be

06:41:37.510 --> 06:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:41:40.150 --> 06:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
stopped because we are doing so well at
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
this point and i anticipate that that
 
06:41:44.230 --> 06:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
will continue the amendment addresses
 
06:41:46.628 --> 06:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination beginning on page 1 line
 
06:41:50.230 --> 06:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
13 a passport infringes upon the
 
06:41:52.628 --> 06:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
americans disability act and the fourth
 
06:41:52.638 --> 06:41:54.230 align:start position:0%
americans disability act and the fourth
amendment

06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:41:56.788 --> 06:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
second point medical privacy rights are
 
06:41:59.750 --> 06:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
valued by most i as a registered nurse
 
06:42:01.830 --> 06:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
and instructor have instilled in my
 
06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
students the legal obligations and
 
06:42:07.590 --> 06:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of violating the hipaa law
 
06:42:10.390 --> 06:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
such privacy rights must be honored
 
06:42:12.628 --> 06:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
society should not be divided into those
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and those not it's it is not
 
06:42:19.030 --> 06:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
right it is divisive the amendment does
 
06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
highlight healthcare healthcare workers
 
06:42:23.830 --> 06:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
and their employer and the definition of
 
06:42:25.430 --> 06:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
direct threat
 
06:42:28.390 --> 06:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
and number three communicable disease
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
immunization registry
 
06:42:34.548 --> 06:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
page three lines five through eight
 
06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to respecting patients
 
06:42:38.868 --> 06:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
patients privacy
 
06:42:40.948 --> 06:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
and informed consent
 
06:42:43.670 --> 06:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
the registry should be an opt-in versus
 
06:42:46.390 --> 06:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
an opt-out procedure what i've seen over
 
06:42:46.400 --> 06:42:47.190 align:start position:0%
an opt-out procedure what i've seen over
my

06:42:47.190 --> 06:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:42:49.670 --> 06:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
i hate to say this 40 years as a
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
registered nurse is that if it's
 
06:42:55.430 --> 06:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
an opt-out both in the school system and
 
06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the medical field
 
06:43:00.868 --> 06:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's just assumed that everybody unless
 
06:43:04.708 --> 06:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
you hear otherwise wants this to be done
 
06:43:08.390 --> 06:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you ask the medical professionals
 
06:43:11.510 --> 06:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
to have it as an opt-in registry
 
06:43:13.510 --> 06:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
then you are respecting the patient
 
06:43:16.150 --> 06:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're giving them informed consent
 
06:43:17.910 --> 06:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
patients expect physicians and
 
06:43:20.310 --> 06:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturers for example
 
06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
to itemize potential risks and benefits
 
06:43:26.310 --> 06:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
when proposing surgery or medications
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
have you listened to a tv ad marketing
 
06:43:31.030 --> 06:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
the new biological drug sometimes the
 
06:43:32.868 --> 06:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
side effects sound scarier than the
 
06:43:32.878 --> 06:43:34.390 align:start position:0%
side effects sound scarier than the
diagnosis

06:43:34.390 --> 06:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
06:43:36.788 --> 06:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
a vaccine registry with opt out
 
06:43:36.798 --> 06:43:37.990 align:start position:0%
a vaccine registry with opt out
mechanism

06:43:37.990 --> 06:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
06:43:39.990 --> 06:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
has a high probability that the health
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
care provider will not be spending the
 
06:43:44.868 --> 06:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
time with the patient explaining the
 
06:43:47.270 --> 06:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
registry and sharing
 
06:43:47.280 --> 06:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
registry and sharing
the

06:43:47.990 --> 06:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:43:50.390 --> 06:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
and regarding sharing the immunization
 
06:43:53.270 --> 06:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
records opt-out is not an acceptable
 
06:43:55.430 --> 06:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
policy in my opinion with an opt-in
 
06:43:57.110 --> 06:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
policy the patient is assured the
 
06:43:59.590 --> 06:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
provider explains the purpose and then
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
the patient chooses to share the medical
 
06:44:02.000 --> 06:44:03.190 align:start position:0%
the patient chooses to share the medical
record

06:44:03.190 --> 06:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
record
 
06:44:05.910 --> 06:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
to authorize it or not authorize it the
 
06:44:07.750 --> 06:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
government is not supposed to collect
 
06:44:09.910 --> 06:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
medical records of their citizens
 
06:44:12.070 --> 06:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
without informed consent
 
06:44:14.070 --> 06:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
when schools and colleges require
 
06:44:16.708 --> 06:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
immunization records and they do for
 
06:44:19.030 --> 06:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
public health reasons the current
 
06:44:21.270 --> 06:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
process of retrieving the required
 
06:44:23.430 --> 06:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
records from the health care provider by
 
06:44:26.070 --> 06:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
the individual or the parent and
 
06:44:27.910 --> 06:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
producing those school
 
06:44:30.628 --> 06:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
records the immunization
 
06:44:33.350 --> 06:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh works very well for the past 40 years
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
and even longer so i don't think that
 
06:44:38.468 --> 06:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
that would infringe on
 
06:44:41.110 --> 06:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that the schools and the
 
06:44:42.788 --> 06:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
children are protected
 
06:44:44.788 --> 06:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time and consideration
 
06:44:46.708 --> 06:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
please go one step further and support
 
06:44:48.468 --> 06:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
this amendment i do believe new
 
06:44:50.628 --> 06:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens will appreciate your
 
06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
thoughtfulness and respect for their
 
06:44:55.910 --> 06:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
cherished rights i'd be happy to take
 
06:44:58.548 --> 06:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you mr chairman
 
06:45:00.070 --> 06:45:00.080 align:start position:0%

thank you very much

thank you mr chair um
 
06:45:08.548 --> 06:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
miss camarada you stated that you had
 
06:45:12.230 --> 06:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
the antibody test is that correct yes i
 
06:45:13.990 --> 06:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:45:14.000 --> 06:45:16.708 align:start position:0%

follow-up

06:45:17.750 --> 06:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:45:20.468 --> 06:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
you said the cost was ten dollars was
 
06:45:20.478 --> 06:45:21.350 align:start position:0%
you said the cost was ten dollars was
that

06:45:21.350 --> 06:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:24.868 --> 06:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
the actual cost of the lab process to
 
06:45:26.708 --> 06:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
analyze or was that
 
06:45:29.510 --> 06:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
an insurance copay
 
06:45:31.590 --> 06:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
well that's a very good question um
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
labcorp if you go online they
 
06:45:37.190 --> 06:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
tell you that they will offer the test
 
06:45:39.110 --> 06:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the only out-of-pocket
 
06:45:41.670 --> 06:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
expense is ten dollars
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
so and they didn't ask well they had my
 
06:45:45.670 --> 06:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
insurance information for other lab
 
06:45:48.310 --> 06:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
tests so i can't be definite i can't be
 
06:45:51.670 --> 06:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
certain that they didn't charge but um i
 
06:45:54.708 --> 06:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
asked them if my record would be shared
 
06:45:56.948 --> 06:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
with anyone and they said no so i have a
 
06:46:01.430 --> 06:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
so is it likely that the rest of the
 
06:46:06.150 --> 06:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
cost was covered by
 
06:46:08.070 --> 06:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
either state or federal government or
 
06:46:08.080 --> 06:46:09.350 align:start position:0%
either state or federal government or
something

06:46:09.350 --> 06:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:46:11.270 --> 06:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
i cannot answer that question
 
06:46:11.280 --> 06:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
i cannot answer that question

representative
 
06:46:15.910 --> 06:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
i doubt it my sense is no because
 
06:46:17.990 --> 06:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're not sharing that i have the test
 
06:46:18.000 --> 06:46:20.548 align:start position:0%
they're not sharing that i have the test
done

06:46:20.548 --> 06:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:22.708 --> 06:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
well i i'm sure they can't share
 
06:46:24.628 --> 06:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
personal information because of hipaa
 
06:46:26.070 --> 06:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
laws but
 
06:46:28.230 --> 06:46:28.240 align:start position:0%

paula minihan senior vice president
 
06:47:34.708 --> 06:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
state government relations with the new
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association

representing all our hospitals in the
 
06:47:37.920 --> 06:47:38.948 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
state

06:47:38.948 --> 06:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:47:40.788 --> 06:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
we will be testifying on amendment
 
06:47:42.948 --> 06:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
number 1443
 
06:47:46.230 --> 06:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
h to senate bill 155.
 
06:47:47.670 --> 06:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
we do not have any concerns with the
 
06:47:50.548 --> 06:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
underlying bill of one senate bill 155
 
06:47:52.868 --> 06:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
but we do have significant concerns with
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
the amendment number 1443 h
 
06:47:59.830 --> 06:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i will just go through um the items
 
06:48:03.350 --> 06:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
line 20 line item number three lines 23
 
06:48:06.310 --> 06:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
and 25 that language of this provision
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
appears to prohibit vaccines registry
 
06:48:10.948 --> 06:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
which is a current law
 
06:48:10.958 --> 06:48:11.670 align:start position:0%
which is a current law
so

06:48:11.670 --> 06:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:48:13.590 --> 06:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
we support the vaccine registry for
 
06:48:15.430 --> 06:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
public health and medical treatment
 
06:48:17.750 --> 06:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
purposes so we are opposed to that this
 
06:48:17.760 --> 06:48:18.788 align:start position:0%
purposes so we are opposed to that this
provision

06:48:18.788 --> 06:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:48:22.708 --> 06:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
item 4 lines 26 and 27
 
06:48:24.788 --> 06:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
our read of this provision is that this
 
06:48:27.110 --> 06:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
would effectively create and opt-in for
 
06:48:28.868 --> 06:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry which we are
 
06:48:32.070 --> 06:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to again current law allows for
 
06:48:34.708 --> 06:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
an opt-out if the patient or the parent
 
06:48:37.430 --> 06:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
so chooses requiring an opt-in for the
 
06:48:39.430 --> 06:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry is not workable and
 
06:48:40.868 --> 06:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
would be extremely burdensome and
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
problematic it also seems to contradict
 
06:48:46.230 --> 06:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
with the provisions in item three which
 
06:48:48.230 --> 06:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
i commented above
 
06:48:48.240 --> 06:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
i commented above
or

06:48:49.590 --> 06:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:48:51.830 --> 06:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
alternatively is this intended to
 
06:48:53.670 --> 06:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
require vaccine information to be
 
06:48:55.830 --> 06:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
separated from the person's medical
 
06:48:59.030 --> 06:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
record it's very unclear to us
 
06:48:59.040 --> 06:49:02.070 align:start position:0%
record it's very unclear to us
item

06:49:02.070 --> 06:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:02.080 --> 06:49:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
six

06:49:03.510 --> 06:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
six
 
06:49:05.990 --> 06:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we already previously testified in
 
06:49:08.788 --> 06:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to on a similar provision to
 
06:49:11.430 --> 06:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
this um to a previous amendment when it
 
06:49:13.868 --> 06:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
was heard in this committee um number
 
06:49:13.878 --> 06:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
was heard in this committee um number
1149

06:49:15.510 --> 06:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
1149
 
06:49:18.788 --> 06:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
heard on april 27th this language is
 
06:49:21.670 --> 06:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
problematic and unworkable as previously
 
06:49:25.590 --> 06:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
stated um a direct threat as as is
 
06:49:29.350 --> 06:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
defined is um and i won't i won't
 
06:49:31.990 --> 06:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
quote it because i'm i know you're
 
06:49:34.708 --> 06:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
running out of time but it is really
 
06:49:36.788 --> 06:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
problematic because it requires
 
06:49:40.230 --> 06:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
individual assessments of every employee
 
06:49:42.070 --> 06:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state of new hampshire
 
06:49:44.310 --> 06:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
employ approximately forty one thousand
 
06:49:46.628 --> 06:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
individuals the requirement to
 
06:49:49.030 --> 06:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
individually assess each individual
 
06:49:51.270 --> 06:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
employee is not feasible and equates to
 
06:49:53.190 --> 06:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate
 
06:49:55.590 --> 06:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals care for sick people including
 
06:49:58.628 --> 06:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
those that have contracted covid19 this
 
06:50:01.510 --> 06:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
must they must ensure that their staff
 
06:50:03.670 --> 06:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
their patients and others that enter the
 
06:50:06.070 --> 06:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
hospital are always safe the amendment
 
06:50:07.750 --> 06:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
does not address public safety and
 
06:50:10.230 --> 06:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
public health which must be contemplated
 
06:50:12.230 --> 06:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
when considering safeguards focused on
 
06:50:14.708 --> 06:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
privacy for these reasons we do not
 
06:50:16.468 --> 06:50:16.478 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and we ask that
 
06:50:18.708 --> 06:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
you find it in expedient to legislate
 
06:50:22.468 --> 06:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to testify
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:29.910 --> 06:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:50:31.270 --> 06:50:31.280 align:start position:0%

thank you

06:50:41.590 --> 06:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you called on julia beam she
 
06:50:44.310 --> 06:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
has been admitted to the
 
06:50:46.868 --> 06:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
no to the
 
06:50:48.788 --> 06:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
people who are allowed to testify so
 
06:50:50.868 --> 06:50:50.878 align:start position:0%

maybe call on her
i

06:50:51.990 --> 06:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:50:53.670 --> 06:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
i called her when she was already a
 
06:50:58.868 --> 06:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:02.310 --> 06:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime i'm going to call on
 
06:51:06.310 --> 06:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:08.310 --> 06:51:08.320 align:start position:0%

myself my name is ani malachi i am the
 
06:51:22.230 --> 06:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
executive director of the commission for
 
06:51:23.910 --> 06:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
human rights
 
06:51:26.628 --> 06:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
we are a state agency and we are
 
06:51:29.990 --> 06:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the enforcement of rsa
 
06:51:30.000 --> 06:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
responsible for the enforcement of rsa
354-a

06:51:31.670 --> 06:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
354-a
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is where amendment 1443-h
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
is attempting to
 
06:51:40.230 --> 06:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
attach and let me if you stand by just
 
06:51:41.830 --> 06:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
one moment let me
 
06:51:44.468 --> 06:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
unhook my camera and put it back in here
 
06:51:50.830 --> 06:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:50.840 --> 06:51:52.548 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:51:52.548 --> 06:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:51:56.468 --> 06:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
okay here we are back back with it
 
06:52:00.390 --> 06:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh this amendment is uh germaine
 
06:52:02.708 --> 06:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
well it's a non-german amendment
 
06:52:06.230 --> 06:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
relative to rsa 354-a
 
06:52:07.590 --> 06:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
06:52:08.868 --> 06:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire laws against
 
06:52:11.990 --> 06:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination and specifically these
 
06:52:13.670 --> 06:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
laws deal with
 
06:52:13.680 --> 06:52:14.868 align:start position:0%
laws deal with
employment

06:52:14.868 --> 06:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
employment
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
housing public accommodation and k-12
 
06:52:21.030 --> 06:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
education specifically dealing with the
 
06:52:23.990 --> 06:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
1964 civil rights act as it relates to
 
06:52:26.150 --> 06:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
immutable characteristics
 
06:52:30.468 --> 06:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
of individuals i.e age sex race creed
 
06:52:33.430 --> 06:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
color marital status familial status
 
06:52:37.110 --> 06:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
physical or mental disability and
 
06:52:39.750 --> 06:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
national origin
 
06:52:39.760 --> 06:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
national origin
so

06:52:41.030 --> 06:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:52:43.350 --> 06:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
let me try to go through this as quickly
 
06:52:44.948 --> 06:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
06:52:47.030 --> 06:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
in respect to time
 
06:52:50.548 --> 06:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
one of the big concerns for the
 
06:52:50.558 --> 06:52:52.390 align:start position:0%
one of the big concerns for the
commission

06:52:52.390 --> 06:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:52:55.430 --> 06:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
is we weren't invited into the process
 
06:52:58.070 --> 06:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's no conversation to look at what
 
06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
it means for us to enforce something
 
06:53:02.628 --> 06:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
like this which we are responsible for
 
06:53:06.230 --> 06:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
enforcing these laws that you all would
 
06:53:06.240 --> 06:53:07.190 align:start position:0%
enforcing these laws that you all would
create

06:53:07.190 --> 06:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
create
 
06:53:09.670 --> 06:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
um and as well as looking at the
 
06:53:12.788 --> 06:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
financial piece along with this
 
06:53:15.990 --> 06:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are several considerations here
 
06:53:19.430 --> 06:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
starting on the on the very front page
 
06:53:21.590 --> 06:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's deference given to the
 
06:53:23.990 --> 06:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
cdc but there is no deference given to
 
06:53:26.468 --> 06:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
the fda who's in charge of looking at
 
06:53:28.628 --> 06:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
our drugs and determining
 
06:53:30.310 --> 06:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
what has approval and what doesn't have
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
approval so leaving that out
 
06:53:35.830 --> 06:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
could quite possibly create
 
06:53:39.590 --> 06:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
issues for employees employers
 
06:53:39.600 --> 06:53:41.110 align:start position:0%
issues for employees employers
businesses

06:53:41.110 --> 06:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
06:53:43.030 --> 06:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
06:53:46.628 --> 06:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
also with the primary care physician
 
06:53:49.510 --> 06:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
information that's stated there
 
06:53:51.270 --> 06:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
specifically for the college students i
 
06:53:52.628 --> 06:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
believe well i think it was for all
 
06:53:52.638 --> 06:53:53.670 align:start position:0%
believe well i think it was for all
students

06:53:53.670 --> 06:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's specific to new hampshire positions
 
06:53:57.200 --> 06:53:59.030 align:start position:0%
it's specific to new hampshire positions
however

06:53:59.030 --> 06:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:54:01.270 --> 06:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
that is that is arduous because there
 
06:54:03.270 --> 06:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
are some people who live in the state of
 
06:54:05.110 --> 06:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but who have doctors
 
06:54:08.070 --> 06:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
potentially in vermont or massachusetts
 
06:54:10.230 --> 06:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
so now you're forcing them to find a
 
06:54:13.110 --> 06:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
doctor here to have this
 
06:54:13.120 --> 06:54:14.548 align:start position:0%
doctor here to have this
information

06:54:14.548 --> 06:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:54:17.750 --> 06:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
dispersed as necessary
 
06:54:19.750 --> 06:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
and before i go any further one of the
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
biggest hiccups with this that i see
 
06:54:24.548 --> 06:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
is that rsa354-a
 
06:54:28.150 --> 06:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
if you read it it already provides for
 
06:54:28.160 --> 06:54:29.430 align:start position:0%
if you read it it already provides for
medical

06:54:29.430 --> 06:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
medical
 
06:54:31.350 --> 06:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
waivers if you want to call it that as
 
06:54:32.948 --> 06:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
well as religious i should say
 
06:54:35.430 --> 06:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions those are already
 
06:54:38.548 --> 06:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
in practice in use and have been since
 
06:54:40.788 --> 06:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the
 
06:54:42.468 --> 06:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
of the commission we've been here since
 
06:54:42.478 --> 06:54:44.230 align:start position:0%
of the commission we've been here since
1965

06:54:44.230 --> 06:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
1965
 
06:54:46.868 --> 06:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
so those things are already
 
06:54:49.510 --> 06:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
allowed and people do use those and what
 
06:54:52.070 --> 06:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
it calls for in a situation in a work
 
06:54:54.150 --> 06:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
environment is that the individual
 
06:54:56.708 --> 06:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
employee enters into the interactive
 
06:54:59.190 --> 06:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
process with the employer
 
06:55:02.708 --> 06:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
so if there were some uh discrimination
 
06:55:05.270 --> 06:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
then they would have a way to address
 
06:55:07.910 --> 06:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
that within the confines of the business
 
06:55:10.150 --> 06:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
provided they have done those steps and
 
06:55:12.468 --> 06:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
exhausted the process within the within
 
06:55:14.948 --> 06:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
the company if they don't seek the
 
06:55:17.750 --> 06:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
remedy that they need they come to us
 
06:55:19.830 --> 06:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
we do not charge for our services you do
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
not have to have an attorney we will
 
06:55:24.390 --> 06:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
listen to the the citizen take their
 
06:55:27.670 --> 06:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
charge and then if it crosses the the
 
06:55:30.070 --> 06:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
threshold which is prima facie then we
 
06:55:32.708 --> 06:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
will docket that charge and serve that
 
06:55:34.948 --> 06:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
business with the charge of
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination in whatever the category
 
06:55:39.430 --> 06:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
that i previously mentioned that they
 
06:55:41.270 --> 06:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
may have done something considered
 
06:55:44.150 --> 06:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
egregious and then we start that process
 
06:55:46.468 --> 06:55:46.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes a business has a legitimate
 
06:55:48.548 --> 06:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
reason for not um
 
06:55:51.110 --> 06:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
for not doing um something that the
 
06:55:52.788 --> 06:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
employee thought that they should have
 
06:55:56.150 --> 06:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
done sometimes it wasn't handled the way
 
06:55:58.150 --> 06:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
that the employee wanted so they're
 
06:56:01.110 --> 06:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
filing a charge of discrimination
 
06:56:04.310 --> 06:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
moving on um so the language here
 
06:56:07.510 --> 06:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
relative to religions and irs religious
 
06:56:10.628 --> 06:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me irs exemptions so that's ch
 
06:56:12.788 --> 06:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge there as well because
 
06:56:14.548 --> 06:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
this language facially discriminates
 
06:56:17.670 --> 06:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
against other religions that are not
 
06:56:19.590 --> 06:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
that are closely held beliefs that are
 
06:56:21.990 --> 06:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
not recognized by the irs so there could
 
06:56:23.590 --> 06:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
be some spiritual beliefs that are
 
06:56:25.110 --> 06:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
closely held
 
06:56:26.868 --> 06:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
06:56:31.110 --> 06:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
given tax-exempt status by the irs and
 
06:56:33.830 --> 06:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
if for for the commission if you have a
 
06:56:36.788 --> 06:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
religious belief that is closely held
 
06:56:39.510 --> 06:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
and you are asking for an exemption for
 
06:56:41.830 --> 06:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that that area is if it's in
 
06:56:44.230 --> 06:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
employment or or education or the the
 
06:56:46.150 --> 06:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
areas that we cover we have jurisdiction
 
06:56:49.590 --> 06:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
over you can come to us and simply are
 
06:56:52.390 --> 06:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
stating it is a closely held belief now
 
06:56:54.150 --> 06:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
closely held we can have that long
 
06:56:56.310 --> 06:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
conversation if it's not something that
 
06:56:58.070 --> 06:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
was that you decided yesterday but
 
06:56:59.830 --> 06:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
something that you have followed for a
 
06:57:01.590 --> 06:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
period of time and there is latitude
 
06:57:03.910 --> 06:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
that is already allowed there and this
 
06:57:06.468 --> 06:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
may also violate the first amendment
 
06:57:07.830 --> 06:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
when you look at it on its face
 
06:57:10.708 --> 06:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
regarding religion and it is also deemed
 
06:57:13.110 --> 06:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
compelled speech which violates the
 
06:57:15.190 --> 06:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
first amendment as well and strict
 
06:57:17.350 --> 06:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
scrutiny would apply
 
06:57:19.670 --> 06:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
moving down very quickly
 
06:57:21.510 --> 06:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at direct threat
 
06:57:23.670 --> 06:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
specifically in our statute we talk a
 
06:57:25.110 --> 06:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
little bit about direct threat and
 
06:57:26.948 --> 06:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
that's dealing with a health and safe
 
06:57:30.230 --> 06:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
health or safety issue and as i said
 
06:57:33.670 --> 06:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
before you already as an employee or as
 
06:57:35.430 --> 06:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
someone in an area of public
 
06:57:37.270 --> 06:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation you already have an
 
06:57:39.110 --> 06:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to enter into that
 
06:57:41.430 --> 06:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
interactive process if i'm someone that
 
06:57:43.430 --> 06:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
cannot get a vaccine
 
06:57:45.510 --> 06:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
or i cannot wear a mask and i want to go
 
06:57:46.788 --> 06:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
into this place and if they have a
 
06:57:49.350 --> 06:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
mandate i can have a conversation with
 
06:57:51.030 --> 06:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
that business
 
06:57:54.390 --> 06:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
to work something out amongst ourselves
 
06:57:55.990 --> 06:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that is important because that
 
06:57:56.000 --> 06:57:57.110 align:start position:0%
and that is important because that
allows

06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
allows
 
06:57:58.750 --> 06:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
all of these things to happen
 
06:58:02.708 --> 06:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
simultaneously um another uh part of the
 
06:58:04.468 --> 06:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
the issue here
 
06:58:04.478 --> 06:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
the issue here
is

06:58:05.430 --> 06:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:58:05.440 --> 06:58:06.468 align:start position:0%
is
that

06:58:06.468 --> 06:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:58:09.990 --> 06:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the antibody levels are also
 
06:58:12.310 --> 06:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
a question because how do you determine
 
06:58:14.868 --> 06:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
what that is how do you set the bar for
 
06:58:17.670 --> 06:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that litmus test is and then if
 
06:58:20.788 --> 06:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
i have a reason that i need a medical or
 
06:58:23.350 --> 06:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption
 
06:58:25.910 --> 06:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
to some degree what has happened here is
 
06:58:28.310 --> 06:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
something that i hold private a medical
 
06:58:30.948 --> 06:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
condition that may not jeopardize what i
 
06:58:34.310 --> 06:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
do in my day job but is something that
 
06:58:36.868 --> 06:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
might create an issue for me to take a
 
06:58:41.430 --> 06:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine and now i have to do this to opt
 
06:58:44.070 --> 06:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
out of the the new legislation
 
06:58:46.310 --> 06:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
now this business has been put on notice
 
06:58:48.868 --> 06:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
for a variety of medical diseases or
 
06:58:51.670 --> 06:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs that they may not have
 
06:58:54.310 --> 06:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
known nor did they need to know and that
 
06:58:56.070 --> 06:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
could create an opportunity for
 
06:58:58.230 --> 06:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination down the line and i'll
 
06:59:00.788 --> 06:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
end it by saying this
 
06:59:03.110 --> 06:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that you do here
 
06:59:05.590 --> 06:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
is you are making a protected class of
 
06:59:08.468 --> 06:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
people that do not do not have immutable
 
06:59:10.390 --> 06:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
characteristics which is part of the
 
06:59:12.548 --> 06:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
discussion i had with the representative
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh relative to hb 506 that let's say for
 
06:59:18.948 --> 06:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
example half of the state and i and i'm
 
06:59:20.230 --> 06:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
sure you all will correct me if i'm
 
06:59:22.390 --> 06:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
wrong if we have roughly one point let's
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
just say one million people here if you
 
06:59:26.548 --> 06:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
make if you pass this piece of
 
06:59:28.628 --> 06:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
legislation what you've effectively done
 
06:59:31.830 --> 06:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
is created a protected class of anyone
 
06:59:33.670 --> 06:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
at any point in time
 
06:59:33.680 --> 06:59:34.390 align:start position:0%
at any point in time
any

06:59:34.390 --> 06:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:59:37.270 --> 06:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the future from today looking 10
 
06:59:39.670 --> 06:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
years back who wants to not take a
 
06:59:42.548 --> 06:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine even if a position that they
 
06:59:42.558 --> 06:59:43.590 align:start position:0%
vaccine even if a position that they
hold

06:59:43.590 --> 06:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
hold
 
06:59:46.070 --> 06:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
requires that you have now made it
 
06:59:47.990 --> 06:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory for that place of
 
06:59:50.468 --> 06:59:50.478 align:start position:0%
business to require something that is
 
06:59:52.628 --> 06:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
medically necessary that is a part of
 
06:59:55.270 --> 06:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
the health or safety and now that that
 
06:59:57.590 --> 06:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
500 000 people could potentially come
 
07:00:00.868 --> 07:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
here to file a charge so i i would like
 
07:00:02.868 --> 07:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
to have us think about it in that
 
07:00:05.430 --> 07:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
perspective as well it's not simply
 
07:00:07.590 --> 07:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
about freedom it's not simply about
 
07:00:09.590 --> 07:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
medicine but there is a large
 
07:00:11.590 --> 07:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement question
 
07:00:14.070 --> 07:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the practicality of this all as well
 
07:00:16.788 --> 07:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
as first amendment rights that that have
 
07:00:19.350 --> 07:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
the possibility of being trampled along
 
07:00:20.788 --> 07:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
with this
 
07:00:25.110 --> 07:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment so whereas uh sb 155 is
 
07:00:27.110 --> 07:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
very narrowly tailored
 
07:00:30.150 --> 07:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment which is 144 3h is
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately very overly broadly
 
07:00:35.430 --> 07:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
tailored which can create a quite a few
 
07:00:37.830 --> 07:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
more unintended consequences than i
 
07:00:39.830 --> 07:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
think any of us could foresee at this
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
time so i thank you for your patience
 
07:00:43.910 --> 07:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your indulgence i
 
07:00:45.270 --> 07:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak
 
07:00:47.430 --> 07:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
before this body i am very happy to take
 
07:00:49.670 --> 07:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have
 
07:00:51.990 --> 07:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schultz
 
07:00:54.070 --> 07:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ma'am
 
07:00:57.430 --> 07:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony i don't know if this
 
07:00:59.270 --> 07:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
comes up um
 
07:01:01.350 --> 07:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
with the work that you do but
 
07:01:03.510 --> 07:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
if it does is there anything in the
 
07:01:06.150 --> 07:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
nuremberg codes that prevent mandatory
 
07:01:08.150 --> 07:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination in
 
07:01:11.110 --> 07:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
private businesses in new hampshire
 
07:01:12.628 --> 07:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
that would and thank you very much for
 
07:01:14.788 --> 07:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
the question representative schultz um
 
07:01:16.868 --> 07:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
that would be outside of my jurisdiction
 
07:01:21.190 --> 07:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
so specifically what i do in rsa 354-a
 
07:01:23.750 --> 07:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
is the laws against discrimination that
 
07:01:26.708 --> 07:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has created based on the
 
07:01:28.390 --> 07:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
federal statute which is the civil
 
07:01:31.510 --> 07:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
rights act of 1964 is where i get my
 
07:01:34.070 --> 07:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction where i have my enforcement
 
07:01:36.868 --> 07:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
and where i have my ability to take
 
07:01:39.590 --> 07:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
complaints and or pass upon complaints
 
07:01:42.868 --> 07:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
and so we specifically cover employment
 
07:01:44.948 --> 07:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
education k through 12 which is fairly
 
07:01:47.990 --> 07:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
new as well as housing and public
 
07:01:50.310 --> 07:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
accommodation so i know you were looking
 
07:01:51.830 --> 07:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
for something a little more specific but
 
07:01:53.430 --> 07:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't have
 
07:01:56.070 --> 07:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction to cover that so it
 
07:01:57.670 --> 07:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
would not be wise for me to speak on
 
07:01:59.590 --> 07:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
something i do not have jurisdictional
 
07:02:01.590 --> 07:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
authority thank you that is helpful
 
07:02:10.788 --> 07:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:12.310 --> 07:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr malachi that'll be it thank
 
07:02:13.750 --> 07:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much thank
 
07:02:17.670 --> 07:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.380 --> 07:02:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.390 --> 07:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:02:33.750 --> 07:02:33.760 align:start position:0%

um to amendment 1468
h

07:02:51.750 --> 07:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
h
 
07:02:54.230 --> 07:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
apparently there's um a couple of
 
07:02:57.030 --> 07:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendments here my understanding is 14
 
07:02:59.750 --> 07:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
43 h is no longer being considered and
 
07:03:01.990 --> 07:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a new amendment to consider
 
07:03:06.788 --> 07:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
um i would oppose 1443 h for the record
 
07:03:08.868 --> 07:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
i appreciate all the good things that
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative roy and others are doing
 
07:03:14.948 --> 07:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this amendment 1468 h
 
07:03:16.310 --> 07:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
however there are provisions written
 
07:03:18.070 --> 07:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
into the amendment that are concerning
 
07:03:19.190 --> 07:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
to me
 
07:03:20.708 --> 07:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
i am the new hampshire director of
 
07:03:22.390 --> 07:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
advocacy with the national vaccine
 
07:03:24.788 --> 07:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
information center and i work to educate
 
07:03:26.548 --> 07:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
and provide resources for vaccine
 
07:03:28.468 --> 07:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns and work to
 
07:03:30.070 --> 07:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
support the human right of informed
 
07:03:30.080 --> 07:03:31.270 align:start position:0%
support the human right of informed
consent

07:03:31.270 --> 07:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
consent
 
07:03:33.030 --> 07:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
i also assist
 
07:03:34.788 --> 07:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
those who have been adversely impacted
 
07:03:37.030 --> 07:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
by vaccination or killed by vaccines as
 
07:03:38.628 --> 07:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
happens to new hampshire children and
 
07:03:41.430 --> 07:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
adults on a regular basis
 
07:03:43.590 --> 07:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many misunderstand current
 
07:03:44.948 --> 07:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
 
07:03:46.708 --> 07:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements are currently
 
07:03:49.030 --> 07:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
imposed on both public and private
 
07:03:51.350 --> 07:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
schools and day cares there is not the
 
07:03:52.788 --> 07:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
option for those who object to
 
07:03:54.788 --> 07:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination to attend a private day care
 
07:03:57.510 --> 07:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
or school the mandates still apply
 
07:03:59.990 --> 07:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
businesses cannot decide for themselves
 
07:04:02.468 --> 07:04:02.478 align:start position:0%
i find it disingenuous the testimony of
 
07:04:04.310 --> 07:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
those who claim to be opposed to this
 
07:04:05.990 --> 07:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that would restrict what
 
07:04:08.070 --> 07:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
businesses can and cannot do
 
07:04:09.910 --> 07:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
while at the same time supporting the
 
07:04:12.468 --> 07:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
current vaccine requirements in fact
 
07:04:14.468 --> 07:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
telling private businesses what they
 
07:04:16.230 --> 07:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
must do
 
07:04:19.190 --> 07:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
expanding exemptions will not set us
 
07:04:21.990 --> 07:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
back 100 years has been testified by
 
07:04:24.628 --> 07:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
beth daly i have served for five years
 
07:04:25.990 --> 07:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
as public member on the board of
 
07:04:27.750 --> 07:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
directors of the new hampshire vaccine
 
07:04:30.708 --> 07:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
association the facts are
 
07:04:33.750 --> 07:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
that 74 of the vaccines purchases
 
07:04:35.910 --> 07:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
purchased by dhhs through the vaccine
 
07:04:37.670 --> 07:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
association and health insurers in new
 
07:04:37.680 --> 07:04:39.350 align:start position:0%
association and health insurers in new
hampshire

07:04:39.350 --> 07:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:04:42.070 --> 07:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
are on a voluntary basis they are not
 
07:04:45.990 --> 07:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
required vaccines this is 74 of a 30
 
07:04:48.468 --> 07:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
million dollar vaccine purchase program
 
07:04:51.830 --> 07:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
as reported by beth daly to our board
 
07:04:53.350 --> 07:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
also at the board meetings of the new
 
07:04:55.190 --> 07:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire vaccine association has been
 
07:04:57.190 --> 07:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
reported that vaccines given to children
 
07:04:59.510 --> 07:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
dropped by about 60 percent
 
07:05:01.750 --> 07:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
over this past year but there have been
 
07:05:05.190 --> 07:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
no outbreaks of childhood illnesses
 
07:05:07.270 --> 07:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
that impact children those are the
 
07:05:09.910 --> 07:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
current facts and evidence as reported
 
07:05:15.030 --> 07:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:16.548 --> 07:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
while there are many good things in this
 
07:05:19.110 --> 07:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
amendment i do object to
 
07:05:21.590 --> 07:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
provision roman numeral b
 
07:05:24.390 --> 07:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
that would be putting in new hampshire
 
07:05:26.708 --> 07:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
statute a pathway for employer vaccine
 
07:05:29.430 --> 07:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
mandates of all vaccines even while
 
07:05:31.830 --> 07:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to provide exemptions
 
07:05:33.350 --> 07:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
we know that exemptions have been
 
07:05:35.670 --> 07:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
removed in other states and no one's
 
07:05:38.150 --> 07:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
medical freedom should be subjected to
 
07:05:40.390 --> 07:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
appeal to government for exemption
 
07:05:42.310 --> 07:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
it will be best to leave this provision
 
07:05:44.230 --> 07:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
out of this good otherwise good
 
07:05:44.240 --> 07:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
out of this good otherwise good
amendment

07:05:45.590 --> 07:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:05:49.190 --> 07:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
i object to the amendment to rsa 141 c
 
07:05:52.150 --> 07:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
20 a that would list required vaccines
 
07:05:54.150 --> 07:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
and expand that list to vaccines not
 
07:05:56.468 --> 07:05:56.478 align:start position:0%
currently listed in state statute
 
07:05:59.830 --> 07:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
including varicella and perhaps others
 
07:06:02.390 --> 07:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
some vaccines are required by rule not
 
07:06:02.400 --> 07:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
some vaccines are required by rule not
statute

07:06:03.510 --> 07:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:06:05.990 --> 07:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
and rules have expiration dates and
 
07:06:07.510 --> 07:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
require rule
 
07:06:09.750 --> 07:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
statutes are permanent and not subject
 
07:06:13.030 --> 07:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
to regular required review that rules
 
07:06:13.040 --> 07:06:13.830 align:start position:0%
to regular required review that rules
are

07:06:13.830 --> 07:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:06:16.230 --> 07:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
please do not add vaccine requirements
 
07:06:18.868 --> 07:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
into statute with this amendment without
 
07:06:20.628 --> 07:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate public hearings on
 
07:06:23.350 --> 07:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
each and every vaccine you desire to add
 
07:06:25.270 --> 07:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
to statute
 
07:06:27.190 --> 07:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate to strike the
 
07:06:29.350 --> 07:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner's authority to determine
 
07:06:33.750 --> 07:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements that now dhhs
 
07:06:35.990 --> 07:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
now that dhhs has entered the vaccine
 
07:06:39.910 --> 07:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
business this was done through rsa 126q
 
07:06:42.310 --> 07:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
that created the vaccine association
 
07:06:46.230 --> 07:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
this has created a conflict for dhhs a
 
07:06:47.990 --> 07:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that the
 
07:06:51.190 --> 07:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
legislature would be correct in removing
 
07:06:53.110 --> 07:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
this would allow for the legislature the
 
07:06:55.430 --> 07:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
public body to propose to properly
 
07:06:57.830 --> 07:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
propose and evaluate any vaccine
 
07:07:00.310 --> 07:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
requirements that may be desired free of
 
07:07:02.628 --> 07:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
any financial incentive or conflicts of
 
07:07:04.548 --> 07:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
interest to propose to impose such
 
07:07:07.350 --> 07:07:07.360 align:start position:0%

make laws and they should retain this

well-being if i choose sb 55 as amended
 
07:09:09.190 --> 07:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
is exactly that we allow citizens to
 
07:09:11.030 --> 07:09:11.040 align:start position:0%

bear

07:09:13.350 --> 07:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
bear
 
07:09:15.670 --> 07:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
privacy of health information at one
 
07:09:17.910 --> 07:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
time was an untouchable subject that
 
07:09:20.230 --> 07:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
garnered the highest protection
 
07:09:22.548 --> 07:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
it has been eroded in a proceeding
 
07:09:24.628 --> 07:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
eroded in the preceding months and we
 
07:09:26.868 --> 07:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
should not allow it to continue
 
07:09:28.468 --> 07:09:28.478 align:start position:0%
no entity should be allowed to
 
07:09:30.468 --> 07:09:30.478 align:start position:0%
discriminate against anyone based on
 
07:09:33.030 --> 07:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
medical information
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
many employers have yet to discuss their
 
07:09:37.350 --> 07:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
stance on the topic but however i'd like
 
07:09:39.190 --> 07:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
to bring up something that i don't think
 
07:09:41.030 --> 07:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
anyone has mentioned is
 
07:09:43.590 --> 07:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
osha uh occupational stealth
 
07:09:45.030 --> 07:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
occupational safety and health
 
07:09:47.030 --> 07:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
administration issued their guidance on
 
07:09:49.190 --> 07:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
employers that require vaccinations as
 
07:09:50.788 --> 07:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
of 20 april
 
07:09:53.030 --> 07:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
of this year and they say that any
 
07:09:53.040 --> 07:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
of this year and they say that any
adverse

07:09:54.310 --> 07:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
07:09:56.390 --> 07:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
reactions or effects of the coveted
 
07:09:58.708 --> 07:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines will be a recordable incident
 
07:10:01.190 --> 07:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
if the employer requires a vaccination
 
07:10:03.190 --> 07:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
and a recordable instance is the first
 
07:10:06.390 --> 07:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
step in which a
 
07:10:08.628 --> 07:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
workman's comp claim is started
 
07:10:08.638 --> 07:10:09.670 align:start position:0%
workman's comp claim is started
so

07:10:09.670 --> 07:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:10:12.070 --> 07:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think body bodily autonomy should be
 
07:10:14.868 --> 07:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
sacred and should be protected uh this
 
07:10:18.230 --> 07:10:18.240 align:start position:0%

idea
and

07:12:07.350 --> 07:12:07.360 align:start position:0%

i'm
 
07:12:12.628 --> 07:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
personally opposed to that as well
 
07:12:14.070 --> 07:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think we
 
07:12:16.708 --> 07:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
have lost a little bit of
 
07:12:19.270 --> 07:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
the broader perspective in the

discussion of the details here
 
07:12:26.230 --> 07:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out the example of
 
07:12:26.240 --> 07:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out the example of
smallpox

07:12:27.750 --> 07:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
smallpox
 
07:12:31.030 --> 07:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
a scourge which is no longer with us
 
07:12:31.040 --> 07:12:31.830 align:start position:0%
a scourge which is no longer with us
and

07:12:31.830 --> 07:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:12:31.840 --> 07:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
and
the

07:12:33.350 --> 07:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:12:36.708 --> 07:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
removal of that disease from the world
 
07:12:40.788 --> 07:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
was an accomplishment of vaccine
 
07:12:42.948 --> 07:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
and i can remember in my junior high
 
07:12:44.948 --> 07:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
school years
 
07:12:47.190 --> 07:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the 1950s
 
07:12:50.830 --> 07:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
the terror in my parents voices in the
 
07:12:53.510 --> 07:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
springtime when the fear of polio was
 
07:12:55.590 --> 07:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
the discussion around living room coffee
 
07:12:55.600 --> 07:12:57.190 align:start position:0%
the discussion around living room coffee
tables

07:12:57.190 --> 07:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
tables
 
07:12:57.200 --> 07:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
tables
and

07:12:58.390 --> 07:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:13:00.948 --> 07:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
families flocking to the town hall
 
07:13:04.868 --> 07:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
lining up children to get vaccines
 
07:13:04.878 --> 07:13:05.670 align:start position:0%
lining up children to get vaccines
and

07:13:05.670 --> 07:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:13:08.868 --> 07:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
now i can testify as a person involved
 
07:13:11.030 --> 07:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
with rotary international
 
07:13:14.150 --> 07:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
that polio has nearly been wiped out of
 
07:13:15.350 --> 07:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
the world
 
07:13:17.190 --> 07:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
it exists only in
 
07:13:19.430 --> 07:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
two nations any longer
 
07:13:21.430 --> 07:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
and there's reasonable hope
 
07:13:25.030 --> 07:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
that that problem will be put to bed
 
07:13:28.310 --> 07:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
so it is a bit of a mystery to me
 
07:13:28.320 --> 07:13:29.830 align:start position:0%
so it is a bit of a mystery to me
personally

07:13:29.830 --> 07:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
personally
 
07:13:32.628 --> 07:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
why we're throwing barriers up to
 
07:13:32.638 --> 07:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
why we're throwing barriers up to
immunization

07:13:34.310 --> 07:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
07:13:37.030 --> 07:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
when it has such a terrific proven track
 
07:13:37.040 --> 07:13:38.310 align:start position:0%
when it has such a terrific proven track
record

07:13:38.310 --> 07:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
record
 
07:13:42.070 --> 07:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
and particularly to the covid vaccine
 
07:13:44.548 --> 07:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
when we have seen
 
07:13:46.070 --> 07:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
death rates
 
07:13:48.868 --> 07:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
hospitalization rates and severity of
 
07:13:48.878 --> 07:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
hospitalization rates and severity of
disease

07:13:51.110 --> 07:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
disease
 
07:13:51.120 --> 07:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
disease
involvement

07:13:52.310 --> 07:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
07:13:55.590 --> 07:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
plummet in places where vaccine is well
 
07:13:55.600 --> 07:13:57.750 align:start position:0%
plummet in places where vaccine is well
distributed

07:13:57.750 --> 07:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
07:14:00.548 --> 07:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
i speak specifically
 
07:14:03.510 --> 07:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the medical society as well
 
07:14:05.670 --> 07:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
07:14:08.390 --> 07:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry matter
 
07:14:10.468 --> 07:14:10.478 align:start position:0%
we've heard discussion
 
07:14:12.230 --> 07:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh testimony
 
07:14:12.240 --> 07:14:13.910 align:start position:0%
uh testimony
that

07:14:13.910 --> 07:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:14:16.868 --> 07:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry is a federal
 
07:14:18.948 --> 07:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
requirement for us to be able to carry
 
07:14:22.230 --> 07:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
on our covet vaccine program
 
07:14:25.110 --> 07:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
i think as another public health matter
 
07:14:27.350 --> 07:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have had terrible behavioral health
 
07:14:27.360 --> 07:14:28.548 align:start position:0%
we have had terrible behavioral health
issues

07:14:28.548 --> 07:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
issues
 
07:14:30.628 --> 07:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
with suicide
 
07:14:32.788 --> 07:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
to some degree more importantly to
 
07:14:34.390 --> 07:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
greater involvement
 
07:14:36.948 --> 07:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
with the opioid epidemic
 
07:14:36.958 --> 07:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
with the opioid epidemic
and

07:14:38.390 --> 07:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:38.400 --> 07:14:39.590 align:start position:0%
and
every

07:14:39.590 --> 07:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
every
 
07:14:42.788 --> 07:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
detail that i can think of supports the
 
07:14:46.708 --> 07:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
notion of more adequate vaccination
 
07:14:50.628 --> 07:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
including childhood vaccines not less
 
07:14:51.910 --> 07:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
and then i would like to speak
 
07:14:54.070 --> 07:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
07:14:54.080 --> 07:14:54.868 align:start position:0%
specifically to
the

07:14:54.868 --> 07:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:14:58.150 --> 07:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
opt-out versus opt-in
 
07:14:58.160 --> 07:15:00.070 align:start position:0%
opt-out versus opt-in
discussion

07:15:00.070 --> 07:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
07:15:00.080 --> 07:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
discussion
and

07:15:01.030 --> 07:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:15:03.430 --> 07:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's clear even though there's been
 
07:15:05.670 --> 07:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
conflicting testimony
 
07:15:05.680 --> 07:15:08.230 align:start position:0%
conflicting testimony
that

07:15:08.230 --> 07:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:10.150 --> 07:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
opt in
 
07:15:13.030 --> 07:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
is another barrier to vaccination
 
07:15:14.948 --> 07:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony from the hospital
 
07:15:14.958 --> 07:15:16.468 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony from the hospital
association

07:15:16.468 --> 07:15:16.478 align:start position:0%
association
 
07:15:18.788 --> 07:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to present that testimony
 
07:15:20.628 --> 07:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself
 
07:15:23.910 --> 07:15:23.920 align:start position:0%

07:17:04.788 --> 07:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
point out a few points uh contrary to dr
 
07:17:07.270 --> 07:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
smith's testimony that reported injuries
 
07:17:10.788 --> 07:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
and bears are misrepresented or unproven
 
07:17:13.670 --> 07:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
a cdc-funded study that concluded in
 
07:17:13.680 --> 07:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
a cdc-funded study that concluded in
2010

07:17:15.590 --> 07:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
2010
 
07:17:17.750 --> 07:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
found that fewer than one percent of
 
07:17:20.708 --> 07:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
actual vaccine injuries form the basis
 
07:17:22.948 --> 07:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
of of report and bears
 
07:17:24.948 --> 07:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
therefore up to 99
 
07:17:27.670 --> 07:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
of actual injuries go unimported
 
07:17:27.680 --> 07:17:29.110 align:start position:0%
of actual injuries go unimported
unreported

07:17:29.110 --> 07:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
unreported
 
07:17:31.350 --> 07:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
the name of the study was the electronic

study
 
07:17:42.230 --> 07:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
um mr chair the supreme court has not
 
07:17:43.590 --> 07:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
ruled on
 
07:17:46.948 --> 07:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
adult vaccine mandates since the 1905
 
07:17:48.708 --> 07:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
decision in jacobson versus
 
07:17:48.718 --> 07:17:50.230 align:start position:0%
decision in jacobson versus
massachusetts

07:17:50.230 --> 07:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
07:17:52.708 --> 07:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
a time well before the development of
 
07:17:54.548 --> 07:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
modern medical essex
 
07:17:56.948 --> 07:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
even then what the court upheld was a
 
07:17:59.590 --> 07:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
five dollar fine
 
07:18:02.868 --> 07:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
against a preacher who had religious and
 
07:18:04.868 --> 07:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
medical objections to the smallpox
 
07:18:04.878 --> 07:18:08.788 align:start position:0%
medical objections to the smallpox
vaccination

07:18:08.788 --> 07:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:11.510 --> 07:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
this was not a case of a possible
 
07:18:14.548 --> 07:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
devastating loss of career or livelihood
 
07:18:17.030 --> 07:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is significant doubt at this time
 
07:18:19.430 --> 07:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
where the court would uphold an employer
 
07:18:21.750 --> 07:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate against a sincere
 
07:18:23.990 --> 07:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
religious objection
 
07:18:25.990 --> 07:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
in contrast to the testimony of the
 
07:18:27.590 --> 07:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative of the new hampshire
 
07:18:29.910 --> 07:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights
 
07:18:32.310 --> 07:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
for many with long-standing religious
 
07:18:32.320 --> 07:18:33.590 align:start position:0%
for many with long-standing religious
objections

07:18:33.590 --> 07:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
objections
 
07:18:35.830 --> 07:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine-free state of their physical
 
07:18:38.310 --> 07:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
bodies is a permanent attribute
 
07:18:40.150 --> 07:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
after all what we are talking about
 
07:18:42.868 --> 07:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
today is discrimination based on the
 
07:18:46.070 --> 07:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
physical attribute that is whether their
 
07:18:48.628 --> 07:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
immune systems are modified by a vaccine
 
07:18:49.910 --> 07:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
or not
 
07:18:51.670 --> 07:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
i find it interesting that certain
 
07:18:53.830 --> 07:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses have questioned the regulation
 
07:18:55.830 --> 07:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
of private businesses
 
07:18:57.990 --> 07:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
that practice discrimination and hiring
 
07:18:59.270 --> 07:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
and employment
 
07:19:02.310 --> 07:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the civil rights act of 1964
 
07:19:04.708 --> 07:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
was a landmark legislation that held
 
07:19:06.628 --> 07:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
private employers and public
 
07:19:08.948 --> 07:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
accommodations to a standard of human
 
07:19:11.190 --> 07:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
rights that prohibited them from taking
 
07:19:13.670 --> 07:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
certain actions that were discriminatory
 
07:19:14.868 --> 07:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
in nature
 
07:19:17.430 --> 07:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
if we reject this amendment based on the
 
07:19:19.110 --> 07:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
theory that we cannot regulate
 
07:19:21.430 --> 07:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination in private businesses are
 
07:19:23.350 --> 07:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
we calling into questioning the entire
 
07:19:25.590 --> 07:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
premise of the civil rights movement in
 
07:19:28.230 --> 07:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
this country i hope not and that will
 
07:19:30.548 --> 07:19:30.558 align:start position:0%

07:20:22.628 --> 07:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
has two prohibitions in it
 
07:20:25.190 --> 07:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
the first prohibition would prevent an
 
07:20:27.110 --> 07:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
employer from simply asking about the
 
07:20:28.708 --> 07:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine status
 
07:20:30.548 --> 07:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
and the second would include a
 
07:20:32.868 --> 07:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
prohibition about making an employment
 
07:20:35.430 --> 07:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
decision and that language many of our
 
07:20:38.070 --> 07:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
members pointed out is not specific on
 
07:20:40.150 --> 07:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
what an employment decision is and i'll
 
07:20:42.390 --> 07:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
get into that in a little bit
 
07:20:43.990 --> 07:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the opposition
 
07:20:46.070 --> 07:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
really begins with the question for the
 
07:20:49.190 --> 07:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
association members and that is whether
 
07:20:52.150 --> 07:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
or not business owners may control their
 
07:20:52.160 --> 07:20:53.990 align:start position:0%
or not business owners may control their
workplace

07:20:53.990 --> 07:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
07:20:55.350 --> 07:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
07:20:58.070 --> 07:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
among the responses we got from members
 
07:20:59.670 --> 07:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
when asking about this particular
 
07:21:02.310 --> 07:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
amendment it was very frequent for
 
07:21:04.548 --> 07:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
members to use the term government
 
07:21:04.558 --> 07:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
members to use the term government
overreach

07:21:06.070 --> 07:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
overreach
 
07:21:09.350 --> 07:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
now employers are responsible for the
 
07:21:09.360 --> 07:21:10.788 align:start position:0%
now employers are responsible for the
safety

07:21:10.788 --> 07:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
safety
 
07:21:13.670 --> 07:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
of both employees and customers that's a
 
07:21:13.680 --> 07:21:14.788 align:start position:0%
of both employees and customers that's a
reality

07:21:14.788 --> 07:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
reality
 
07:21:16.548 --> 07:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
they have to make decisions on a daily
 
07:21:18.628 --> 07:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
basis on a regular basis about safety
 
07:21:20.310 --> 07:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
practices all the time
 
07:21:22.390 --> 07:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that may include knowing which
 
07:21:24.390 --> 07:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
employees are vaccinated for several
 
07:21:24.400 --> 07:21:25.590 align:start position:0%
employees are vaccinated for several
reasons

07:21:25.590 --> 07:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
07:21:28.070 --> 07:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
for example the amendment does not take
 
07:21:30.070 --> 07:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
into account a business owner wishing to
 
07:21:33.190 --> 07:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
protect at-risk employees for example
 
07:21:35.750 --> 07:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
employees who cannot take a vaccine due
 
07:21:37.750 --> 07:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
to analogy
 
07:21:39.590 --> 07:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
it also does not take into account
 
07:21:42.390 --> 07:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
retailers whose employees must enter
 
07:21:45.030 --> 07:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
other locations to deliver uh items such
 
07:21:47.430 --> 07:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
as appliances or furniture
 
07:21:49.910 --> 07:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
large quantities of of goods
 
07:21:52.788 --> 07:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
um in a location where there might be a
 
07:21:55.110 --> 07:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
person at risk
 
07:21:56.708 --> 07:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's the population is at risk
 
07:21:58.548 --> 07:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
or a single person
 
07:22:00.788 --> 07:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
without the ability to know who who is
 
07:22:03.190 --> 07:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
and who isn't vaccinated a retailer
 
07:22:05.510 --> 07:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
cannot make decisions about personnel
 
07:22:06.868 --> 07:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
and scheduling
 
07:22:07.910 --> 07:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
when they're aware of those
 
07:22:10.468 --> 07:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
circumstances so
 
07:22:12.628 --> 07:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
lastly i would point out that if the
 
07:22:15.110 --> 07:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
business owner cannot ask a person about
 
07:22:18.788 --> 07:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination status then perhaps in some
 
07:22:20.548 --> 07:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
circumstance they can't loosen
 
07:22:22.390 --> 07:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions that they would impose in
 
07:22:24.948 --> 07:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
the business on employees wearing masks
 
07:22:27.670 --> 07:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
or customers distancing
 
07:22:30.070 --> 07:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
as soon as they can if they knew uh
 
07:22:32.230 --> 07:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
which employees were vaccinated
 
07:22:33.910 --> 07:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer your questions mr
 
07:22:33.920 --> 07:22:34.788 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer your questions mr
chair

07:22:34.788 --> 07:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
chair
 
07:22:38.830 --> 07:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:42.390 --> 07:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh i just a
 
07:22:43.590 --> 07:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
tough question answer i'm not sure
 
07:22:45.750 --> 07:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to answer
 
07:22:47.350 --> 07:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
07:22:49.030 --> 07:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh prevent businesses from
 
07:22:49.040 --> 07:22:50.468 align:start position:0%
uh prevent businesses from
discriminating

07:22:50.468 --> 07:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
discriminating
 
07:22:52.310 --> 07:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
against people based on their medical
 
07:22:52.320 --> 07:22:54.948 align:start position:0%
against people based on their medical
records

07:22:54.948 --> 07:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
records
 
07:22:56.868 --> 07:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
well representative lekkas i think that
 
07:22:58.628 --> 07:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
question is a little bit broader than
 
07:23:01.750 --> 07:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
the the vaccine status contemplated in
 
07:23:03.030 --> 07:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
07:23:05.750 --> 07:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
um medical records are one thing this
 
07:23:08.070 --> 07:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendment strictly deals with vaccine
 
07:23:10.150 --> 07:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
status although it's all vaccine status
 
07:23:12.150 --> 07:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
and not not just covet
 
07:23:13.910 --> 07:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
so you're right i'm not sure i can
 
07:23:15.910 --> 07:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question fully
 
07:23:17.510 --> 07:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:23:21.430 --> 07:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:23.190 --> 07:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:23:25.590 --> 07:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon mr berry
 
07:23:25.600 --> 07:23:26.548 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon mr berry
uh

07:23:26.548 --> 07:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:23:27.910 --> 07:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
good to see you i appreciate your
 
07:23:29.830 --> 07:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
testimony because it certainly widens
 
07:23:31.830 --> 07:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
the scope of uh
 
07:23:35.270 --> 07:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
incidents that are instances that i was
 
07:23:36.948 --> 07:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about and what we've heard
 
07:23:38.788 --> 07:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
about up to this point
 
07:23:38.798 --> 07:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
about up to this point
um

07:23:39.670 --> 07:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:41.750 --> 07:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
but one of the one of the things that i
 
07:23:43.510 --> 07:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've been on the hearing
 
07:23:46.150 --> 07:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
the entire time but one of the
 
07:23:47.910 --> 07:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
things one of the things that good
 
07:23:50.628 --> 07:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
because i i raised a point that i'd like
 
07:23:53.110 --> 07:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
to have you comment on and that is that
 
07:23:53.120 --> 07:23:54.548 align:start position:0%
to have you comment on and that is that
um

07:23:54.548 --> 07:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:56.548 --> 07:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
we've gotten a lot of emails on this
 
07:23:56.558 --> 07:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
we've gotten a lot of emails on this
committee

07:23:57.590 --> 07:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:24:00.628 --> 07:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
mostly in support of the amendment uh
 
07:24:02.468 --> 07:24:02.478 align:start position:0%
but because they have a common theme i
 
07:24:05.590 --> 07:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
think that they are very possibly
 
07:24:07.350 --> 07:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
generated or
 
07:24:10.788 --> 07:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
motivated driven by a common source
 
07:24:14.548 --> 07:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that that that
 
07:24:17.190 --> 07:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
that they protest against is the idea of
 
07:24:19.270 --> 07:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
curating a two-tiered society where you
 
07:24:21.830 --> 07:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
got the vaccinated and the unvaccinated
 
07:24:24.468 --> 07:24:24.478 align:start position:0%
and they're not being treated equally um
 
07:24:27.030 --> 07:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
that certainly is a troubling situation
 
07:24:30.230 --> 07:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh but to the degree that that
 
07:24:33.110 --> 07:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we have businesses in the initial
 
07:24:35.030 --> 07:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment neither one of them have been
 
07:24:35.040 --> 07:24:35.990 align:start position:0%
amendment neither one of them have been
adopted

07:24:35.990 --> 07:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
07:24:37.270 --> 07:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
07:24:37.280 --> 07:24:38.628 align:start position:0%
as you know
uh

07:24:38.628 --> 07:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:24:40.910 --> 07:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the initial
 
07:24:40.920 --> 07:24:42.868 align:start position:0%
the uh the initial
amendment

07:24:42.868 --> 07:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:24:42.878 --> 07:24:44.830 align:start position:0%
amendment
talked

07:24:44.830 --> 07:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
talked
 
07:24:47.990 --> 07:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
about any business which did business
 
07:24:49.990 --> 07:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
would have to abide by they were to be
 
07:24:52.070 --> 07:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
adopted right enacted
 
07:24:55.430 --> 07:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
now as i understand that the new um
 
07:24:57.590 --> 07:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to make all
 
07:25:00.548 --> 07:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
businesses uh subject to it
 
07:25:00.558 --> 07:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
businesses uh subject to it
uh

07:25:01.910 --> 07:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:25:04.628 --> 07:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
does that strike you
 
07:25:05.990 --> 07:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's that clearly would have been a
 
07:25:08.310 --> 07:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
two-tiered society right some businesses
 
07:25:10.468 --> 07:25:10.478 align:start position:0%
are prohibited under the statute
 
07:25:13.350 --> 07:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
some would have been um and would have
 
07:25:16.150 --> 07:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
been free to do whatever they wanted to
 
07:25:18.548 --> 07:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
um in that regard
 
07:25:21.270 --> 07:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:23.590 --> 07:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think the new amendment is going to
 
07:25:25.990 --> 07:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
spread it statewide
 
07:25:29.750 --> 07:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh is that workable in your judgment
 
07:25:31.750 --> 07:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the two-tiered situation to
 
07:25:33.030 --> 07:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
some degree
 
07:25:36.390 --> 07:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
but but it but it imposes
 
07:25:39.430 --> 07:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
now on every business in the state is is
 
07:25:41.590 --> 07:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
that workable in your judgment
 
07:25:44.070 --> 07:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if if i can answer that
 
07:25:45.830 --> 07:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
question that you know i think a legal
 
07:25:47.670 --> 07:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
expert would have to weigh in on whether
 
07:25:50.150 --> 07:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's workable or not um you may have
 
07:25:51.750 --> 07:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
noticed representative schmidt the
 
07:25:54.070 --> 07:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
retail association did not
 
07:25:56.310 --> 07:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
i did not present verbal testimony on
 
07:25:58.390 --> 07:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
that that previous hearing on the on the
 
07:26:00.708 --> 07:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
previous amendment um
 
07:26:02.468 --> 07:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
and i should mention by the way that i
 
07:26:04.948 --> 07:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
think ms malachi touched on the
 
07:26:07.030 --> 07:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination portion of the bill
 
07:26:08.230 --> 07:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
because it seemed to come in two
 
07:26:09.750 --> 07:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
sections which is why i didn't speak to
 
07:26:11.350 --> 07:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
it um
 
07:26:13.510 --> 07:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
but you know relative to a two-tiered
 
07:26:15.590 --> 07:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
system i think
 
07:26:17.910 --> 07:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know no matter what employment
 
07:26:20.708 --> 07:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
decisions people are making uh you know
 
07:26:23.670 --> 07:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
employers make a lot of decisions that
 
07:26:25.510 --> 07:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
they feel are good for their business
 
07:26:27.430 --> 07:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
and good for their customer base with
 
07:26:30.150 --> 07:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
the exception of those areas that are
 
07:26:32.548 --> 07:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
protected within the
 
07:26:34.628 --> 07:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
human rights statute
 
07:26:37.750 --> 07:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if this is creating a
 
07:26:39.910 --> 07:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system i think the bottom
 
07:26:41.910 --> 07:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
line for our members is they want to be
 
07:26:43.270 --> 07:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
able to control
 
07:26:46.230 --> 07:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
their own work space
 
07:26:49.030 --> 07:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to health
 
07:26:49.040 --> 07:26:50.788 align:start position:0%
especially with regard to health
right

07:26:50.788 --> 07:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:26:53.190 --> 07:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and good to see you all as
 
07:26:53.200 --> 07:26:54.388 align:start position:0%

nice to see you too
 
07:26:59.350 --> 07:26:59.360 align:start position:0%

i'm going to now call on
 
07:27:19.430 --> 07:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:20.788 --> 07:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:27:22.948 --> 07:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my my name is leslie
 
07:27:22.958 --> 07:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my my name is leslie
nuchow

07:27:24.070 --> 07:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
nuchow
 
07:27:28.310 --> 07:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'm a musician and a registered nurse
 
07:27:30.070 --> 07:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i wish you could see
 
07:27:32.788 --> 07:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
the image that i have in front of me
 
07:27:34.708 --> 07:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
07:27:37.750 --> 07:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
it is of a native american lakota man
 
07:27:39.110 --> 07:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
in shackles
 
07:27:41.830 --> 07:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
with a ball and chain
 
07:27:44.868 --> 07:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
he was being punished because he had his
 
07:27:47.750 --> 07:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
own personal medical beliefs
 
07:27:49.590 --> 07:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
he was made a second-class citizen
 
07:27:51.750 --> 07:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
because of his own personal medical
 
07:27:51.760 --> 07:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
because of his own personal medical
beliefs

07:27:54.070 --> 07:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
07:27:56.230 --> 07:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
my family and i fled to new hampshire
 
07:27:58.468 --> 07:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
seeking refuge for our own personal
 
07:28:00.708 --> 07:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
medical beliefs
 
07:28:02.788 --> 07:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire stands as not only a
 
07:28:04.388 --> 07:28:04.398 align:start position:0%
symbol of freedom
 
07:28:08.628 --> 07:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
but a tangible haven for people like us
 
07:28:10.868 --> 07:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
to institute a vaccine passport would
 
07:28:13.190 --> 07:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
make second-class citizens of people
 
07:28:16.628 --> 07:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
like me and my family
 
07:28:20.070 --> 07:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
as we know vaccines are not risk-free
 
07:28:22.948 --> 07:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
so to mandate a medical procedure
 
07:28:26.070 --> 07:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
like the vaccine would remove my right
 
07:28:28.150 --> 07:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
to bodily autonomy
 
07:28:31.190 --> 07:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
and this is a human right
 
07:28:34.310 --> 07:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
this is why i support sb-155's amendment
 
07:28:38.388 --> 07:28:38.398 align:start position:0%
1468-h banning vaccine passports
 
07:28:40.468 --> 07:28:40.478 align:start position:0%
and protecting our individual rights as
 
07:28:43.270 --> 07:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
sovereign human beings to make our own
 
07:28:46.388 --> 07:28:46.398 align:start position:0%
personal medical decisions please do not
 
07:28:48.708 --> 07:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
make us out of second-class citizens
 
07:28:51.030 --> 07:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
please do not punish us with a ball and
 
07:28:54.310 --> 07:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:59.670 --> 07:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:02.708 --> 07:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm going to call mr gary
 
07:29:02.718 --> 07:29:09.750 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm going to call mr gary
abbott

07:29:09.750 --> 07:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:14.150 --> 07:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:16.310 --> 07:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much chairman uh
 
07:29:18.708 --> 07:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
for the record my name's gary abbott i'm
 
07:29:20.628 --> 07:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
the executive vice president of the
 
07:29:22.948 --> 07:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
 
07:29:22.958 --> 07:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of new
hampshire

07:29:25.430 --> 07:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:29:28.310 --> 07:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
this being a late bill i have not
 
07:29:30.150 --> 07:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
completely vetted this with all the
 
07:29:32.150 --> 07:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
association members
 
07:29:36.468 --> 07:29:36.478 align:start position:0%
but i want to raise something a concern
 
07:29:38.788 --> 07:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
it really is in regard to the same thing
 
07:29:41.510 --> 07:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
curtis berry kind of talked about
 
07:29:43.270 --> 07:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
07:29:45.670 --> 07:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
this part seven of the bill a of the
 
07:29:48.070 --> 07:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill regarding um
 
07:29:51.670 --> 07:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know the assessment of direct threat
 
07:29:53.670 --> 07:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
i represent commercial and industrial
 
07:29:53.680 --> 07:29:55.190 align:start position:0%
i represent commercial and industrial
contractors

07:29:55.190 --> 07:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
07:29:57.270 --> 07:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
some of those building contractors work
 
07:30:01.350 --> 07:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
directly for health care nursing homes
 
07:30:04.070 --> 07:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
those kind of things we're anticipating
 
07:30:07.430 --> 07:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
because of the coronavirus that's those
 
07:30:10.230 --> 07:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
institutions that have put in place that
 
07:30:12.070 --> 07:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to be vaccinated that
 
07:30:13.510 --> 07:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
works there
 
07:30:15.830 --> 07:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
when we come in to do a project they may
 
07:30:18.708 --> 07:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
through our contract put that we have to
 
07:30:21.030 --> 07:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated as well
 
07:30:23.270 --> 07:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm raising the concern here because
 
07:30:25.110 --> 07:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's not really clear reading the
 
07:30:27.670 --> 07:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
language of the bill
 
07:30:29.910 --> 07:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
if i'm not allowed because i don't do
 
07:30:32.230 --> 07:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
those projects every day
 
07:30:34.468 --> 07:30:34.478 align:start position:0%
and i'm and i might not meet the
 
07:30:36.310 --> 07:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
complete definition here there'll be a
 
07:30:38.230 --> 07:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
question there'll definitely be a legal
 
07:30:40.468 --> 07:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
question that comes up
 
07:30:43.110 --> 07:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
because my business does try to work on
 
07:30:45.350 --> 07:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
one of those projects if i'm not able to
 
07:30:47.670 --> 07:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
ask of whether an employee has been
 
07:30:47.680 --> 07:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
ask of whether an employee has been
vaccinated

07:30:49.190 --> 07:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
07:30:51.910 --> 07:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
that could create some real difficulties
 
07:30:53.190 --> 07:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
07:30:55.110 --> 07:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to bring that up to the
 
07:30:58.230 --> 07:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
committee as a concern
 
07:31:01.190 --> 07:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's really a contractual concern of us
 
07:31:03.590 --> 07:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to work for another party
 
07:31:04.948 --> 07:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
that is
 
07:31:07.030 --> 07:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i in my definition might be
 
07:31:09.110 --> 07:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
classified under this direct threat
 
07:31:09.120 --> 07:31:10.310 align:start position:0%
classified under this direct threat
language

07:31:10.310 --> 07:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
07:31:12.150 --> 07:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
but it's just not clear
 
07:31:13.910 --> 07:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
when i'm hiring people throughout the
 
07:31:17.030 --> 07:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
year that i can ask that question
 
07:31:18.708 --> 07:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
because those people that are not
 
07:31:18.718 --> 07:31:20.150 align:start position:0%
because those people that are not
vaccinated

07:31:20.150 --> 07:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
07:31:22.070 --> 07:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
through the contract probably will not
 
07:31:24.070 --> 07:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
be allowed to work on that project but
 
07:31:27.590 --> 07:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
it looks like there's an awful lot of
 
07:31:29.750 --> 07:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions that my members will have for
 
07:31:31.910 --> 07:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
me and i just wanted to raise that with
 
07:31:33.510 --> 07:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
the committee i know my testimony is
 
07:31:36.150 --> 07:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
much different than what you've heard
 
07:31:36.160 --> 07:31:37.750 align:start position:0%
much different than what you've heard
before

07:31:37.750 --> 07:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
07:31:39.590 --> 07:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
but it's more of the legal of how this
 
07:31:42.230 --> 07:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
is going to work when some businesses
 
07:31:43.270 --> 07:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
meet that
 
07:31:45.430 --> 07:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
definition of direct threat
 
07:31:47.510 --> 07:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
where the people i represent end up
 
07:31:49.910 --> 07:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
having to go to those places that are
 
07:31:51.830 --> 07:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
into that condition with that i would
 
07:31:53.910 --> 07:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
end my testimony i'm not really
 
07:31:55.270 --> 07:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
into the other
 
07:31:57.670 --> 07:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh effective of the vaccine and all of
 
07:31:59.110 --> 07:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
those other issues that you've heard
 
07:32:01.190 --> 07:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
today but really just wanted to make
 
07:32:03.270 --> 07:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
sure that the committee was aware that
 
07:32:05.270 --> 07:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
we we do have some concerns of how that
 
07:32:07.670 --> 07:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
would work for businesses that fluctuate
 
07:32:10.628 --> 07:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
between types
 
07:32:11.750 --> 07:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:32:13.510 --> 07:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that to the
 
07:32:15.910 --> 07:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee's attention
 
07:32:17.670 --> 07:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
07:32:21.270 --> 07:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:24.548 --> 07:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
see any questions so thank you
 
07:32:26.948 --> 07:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
the least likely lobbyist i would have
 
07:32:29.590 --> 07:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
expected to see today gary well you know
 
07:32:31.590 --> 07:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
i will tell you i i listened to the
 
07:32:33.350 --> 07:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
early testimony
 
07:32:35.190 --> 07:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then i was able to come back wasn't
 
07:32:37.270 --> 07:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
able to stay with you but i just wanted
 
07:32:39.350 --> 07:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
to raise that because this is similar to
 
07:32:41.110 --> 07:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
some other issues that we've run into
 
07:32:43.030 --> 07:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
statutes before
 
07:32:43.040 --> 07:32:44.070 align:start position:0%
statutes before
but

07:32:44.070 --> 07:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:32:45.590 --> 07:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure the committee
 
07:32:46.708 --> 07:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
was aware
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
07:32:56.150 --> 07:32:56.160 align:start position:0%

07:33:24.000 --> 07:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
to sound a lot like mr berries and mr

07:33:25.430 --> 07:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
abbotts
 
07:33:26.948 --> 07:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
our mission and our primary
 
07:33:28.788 --> 07:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to provide quality
 
07:33:30.708 --> 07:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
care and a safe environment and
 
07:33:32.948 --> 07:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals and health facilities employ a
 
07:33:34.708 --> 07:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
variety of
 
07:33:36.628 --> 07:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
in a variety of strategies to ensure a
 
07:33:39.030 --> 07:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
safe environment and one of the elements
 
07:33:41.190 --> 07:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
of that of that strategy is a healthy
 
07:33:41.200 --> 07:33:42.310 align:start position:0%
of that of that strategy is a healthy
workforce

07:33:42.310 --> 07:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
07:33:44.628 --> 07:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
we have significant concerns about the
 
07:33:46.548 --> 07:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
exemption for the medical facilities
 
07:33:48.548 --> 07:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this amendment
 
07:33:51.110 --> 07:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
specifically that direct threat language
 
07:33:52.628 --> 07:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
implementing this
 
07:33:54.310 --> 07:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
exemption would be more than an
 
07:33:55.670 --> 07:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
administrative burden we actually
 
07:33:57.590 --> 07:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe would be near impossible
 
07:33:59.590 --> 07:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock health employs over
 
07:34:02.468 --> 07:34:02.478 align:start position:0%
13 000 employees it's our responsibility
 
07:34:04.388 --> 07:34:04.398 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all of our employees are
 
07:34:06.388 --> 07:34:06.398 align:start position:0%
healthy and prepared to serve our
 
07:34:08.868 --> 07:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
patients across the state
 
07:34:10.788 --> 07:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
i want to highlight for you that we do
 
07:34:14.548 --> 07:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:16.708 --> 07:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
for our current annual influenza program
 
07:34:18.868 --> 07:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
right now one is a religious exemption
 
07:34:21.030 --> 07:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
one's a medical exemption both of those
 
07:34:23.030 --> 07:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions are working and they do work
 
07:34:24.388 --> 07:34:24.398 align:start position:0%
for our employees that look for those
 
07:34:24.398 --> 07:34:25.670 align:start position:0%
for our employees that look for those
exemptions

07:34:25.670 --> 07:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
07:34:27.990 --> 07:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
as a committee you work on examining
 
07:34:29.830 --> 07:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
laws that govern various professional
 
07:34:32.070 --> 07:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
boards you hear testimony and you learn
 
07:34:32.080 --> 07:34:33.030 align:start position:0%
boards you hear testimony and you learn
about

07:34:33.030 --> 07:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:34:33.040 --> 07:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
about
the

07:34:34.070 --> 07:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:34:35.830 --> 07:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
significant workforce challenges that we
 
07:34:37.590 --> 07:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
face here in new hampshire we are
 
07:34:39.190 --> 07:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
navigating serious workforce challenges
 
07:34:40.628 --> 07:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the ability to simply
 
07:34:42.150 --> 07:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
move around our staff if they refuse
 
07:34:42.160 --> 07:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
move around our staff if they refuse
vaccination

07:34:43.510 --> 07:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
07:34:45.270 --> 07:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
passage of this amendment would
 
07:34:46.948 --> 07:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
significantly impact our ability to
 
07:34:49.110 --> 07:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
staff our hospitals and therefore we
 
07:34:50.628 --> 07:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
believe it would impact patient care and
 
07:34:52.628 --> 07:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
access to care
 
07:34:54.150 --> 07:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh second the second reason why we're
 
07:34:55.750 --> 07:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about this amendment is as
 
07:34:57.990 --> 07:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh testified the house
 
07:34:59.510 --> 07:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
 
07:35:01.190 --> 07:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
already heard a bill that contemplated
 
07:35:03.190 --> 07:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
an opt-out process for our state vaccine
 
07:35:06.310 --> 07:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
registry that was house bill 221.
 
07:35:08.230 --> 07:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
in that hearing i testified in
 
07:35:10.628 --> 07:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill and i raised up
 
07:35:10.638 --> 07:35:11.670 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill and i raised up
dr

07:35:11.670 --> 07:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
dr
 
07:35:13.510 --> 07:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
keith loud
 
07:35:15.670 --> 07:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony that he submitted
 
07:35:17.510 --> 07:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
dr loud is the chief
 
07:35:19.430 --> 07:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
physician at the state's only children's
 
07:35:22.548 --> 07:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
hospital chad at dartmouth-hitchcock and
 
07:35:24.070 --> 07:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
of course i didn't read dr lad's
 
07:35:25.750 --> 07:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
testimony but i did highlight a couple
 
07:35:27.030 --> 07:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
of key points
 
07:35:30.948 --> 07:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
cloven 19 has served as a reminder that
 
07:35:33.350 --> 07:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
the value of immunizations we know that
 
07:35:34.948 --> 07:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
immunizations work
 
07:35:36.868 --> 07:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine registries are a tool in our
 
07:35:38.708 --> 07:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
toolbox to increase and sustain
 
07:35:41.030 --> 07:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient vaccine rates and a
 
07:35:42.868 --> 07:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
systematic universal registry allows
 
07:35:44.788 --> 07:35:44.798 align:start position:0%
citizens to seek and obtain
 
07:35:47.590 --> 07:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines in a safe and convenient way
 
07:35:49.990 --> 07:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
and keeps our providers informed
 
07:35:51.990 --> 07:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that an opt-out an opt-in
 
07:35:52.000 --> 07:35:53.110 align:start position:0%
we believe that an opt-out an opt-in
process

07:35:53.110 --> 07:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:35:55.030 --> 07:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be a back a step backwards for new
 
07:35:57.270 --> 07:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire an opt-in registry would
 
07:35:59.830 --> 07:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
hinder new hampshire's work to improve
 
07:36:01.590 --> 07:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of our children
 
07:36:04.070 --> 07:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
and our communities
 
07:36:05.990 --> 07:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
we strongly urge the committee to vote
 
07:36:07.510 --> 07:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
down this amendment and i'm willing to
 
07:36:12.388 --> 07:36:12.398 align:start position:0%

07:38:50.150 --> 07:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that that is um
 
07:38:52.468 --> 07:38:52.478 align:start position:0%
that is common in the workplace
 
07:38:55.190 --> 07:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
and in those situations employers will
 
07:38:57.510 --> 07:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh meet individually and make reasonable
 
07:38:59.910 --> 07:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
comment accommodations it happens every
 
07:39:01.910 --> 07:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
day but this amendment doesn't even
 
07:39:03.830 --> 07:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
allow that conversation to begin to take
 
07:39:07.030 --> 07:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
place so i urge you to reject this
 
07:39:09.110 --> 07:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment i'd be happy to answer any
 
07:39:10.628 --> 07:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you again for the
 
07:39:13.830 --> 07:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
07:39:13.840 --> 07:39:18.468 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
representative

07:39:18.468 --> 07:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:20.548 --> 07:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr juve and thank you for
 
07:39:20.558 --> 07:39:22.070 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr juve and thank you for
justifying

07:39:22.070 --> 07:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
justifying
 
07:39:23.750 --> 07:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
can you um
 
07:39:23.760 --> 07:39:25.190 align:start position:0%
can you um
um

07:39:25.190 --> 07:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:39:27.590 --> 07:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
be specific a little bit about the kinds
 
07:39:30.468 --> 07:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
of businesses you've heard from who
 
07:39:34.628 --> 07:39:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:36.388 --> 07:39:36.398 align:start position:0%
yeah well it really uh thank you for the
 
07:39:39.510 --> 07:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
question representative grota it really
 
07:39:41.910 --> 07:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
is across the board but i would like to
 
07:39:43.590 --> 07:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh remind members of the committee
 
07:39:45.110 --> 07:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
although they try and carve out an
 
07:39:46.788 --> 07:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
exemption for
 
07:39:49.030 --> 07:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
health care workers i'm assuming they're
 
07:39:51.510 --> 07:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
referring to hospitals there's all kinds
 
07:39:53.510 --> 07:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
of other businesses that
 
07:39:53.520 --> 07:39:54.548 align:start position:0%
of other businesses that
that

07:39:54.548 --> 07:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:39:56.868 --> 07:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
have vulnerable um
 
07:39:59.510 --> 07:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh individuals that that are either a
 
07:40:01.350 --> 07:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
part of the business or or customers of
 
07:40:04.468 --> 07:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
the business like day care centers or
 
07:40:04.478 --> 07:40:06.150 align:start position:0%
the business like day care centers or
um

07:40:06.150 --> 07:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:09.110 --> 07:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities even places
 
07:40:10.708 --> 07:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
like airports when you think of the
 
07:40:12.468 --> 07:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
number of people going in and out of an
 
07:40:15.190 --> 07:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
airport each day there's extraordinary
 
07:40:17.910 --> 07:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
risk associated uh
 
07:40:19.910 --> 07:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
by creating a situation where an
 
07:40:21.830 --> 07:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
employee an employer can't even have a
 
07:40:24.230 --> 07:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
discussion with their employee about
 
07:40:26.070 --> 07:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
whether they're vaccinated and if they
 
07:40:28.230 --> 07:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
aren't would they be open to some other
 
07:40:32.070 --> 07:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
type of reasonable accommodation um
 
07:40:34.070 --> 07:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
07:40:36.150 --> 07:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
i i
 
07:40:39.430 --> 07:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
this is not a good amendment and the
 
07:40:41.830 --> 07:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
issues that other uh individuals
 
07:40:44.230 --> 07:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
representing employers have raised
 
07:40:46.548 --> 07:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
is a good reason why
 
07:40:48.788 --> 07:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
it's in general not a good idea for
 
07:40:51.190 --> 07:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
government to be telling employers how
 
07:40:53.350 --> 07:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
to run their businesses they
 
07:40:55.590 --> 07:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
there's just too many
 
07:40:57.190 --> 07:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for unintended
 
07:40:57.200 --> 07:41:02.310 align:start position:0%
opportunities for unintended
consequences

07:41:02.310 --> 07:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:03.110 --> 07:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:41:06.070 --> 07:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
mr giuve it's unfortunate for you that
 
07:41:07.750 --> 07:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
i've that you're
 
07:41:09.430 --> 07:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you this question i've
 
07:41:11.510 --> 07:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
heard all afternoon i guess i
 
07:41:13.350 --> 07:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
volunteered to sit here for four hours
 
07:41:15.670 --> 07:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i can't blame anybody but me
 
07:41:17.510 --> 07:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah as did i
 
07:41:19.110 --> 07:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
well okay but
 
07:41:21.270 --> 07:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
we well you probably got paid more than
 
07:41:23.030 --> 07:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
i did anyway
 
07:41:25.590 --> 07:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm being cranky i don't really want
 
07:41:26.548 --> 07:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
to be
 
07:41:26.558 --> 07:41:27.590 align:start position:0%
to be
look

07:41:27.590 --> 07:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
look
 
07:41:30.628 --> 07:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
this business about business government
 
07:41:33.350 --> 07:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
not telling business what to do this is
 
07:41:35.110 --> 07:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
just really
 
07:41:38.628 --> 07:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
hard to sit through all afternoon
 
07:41:40.948 --> 07:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
i can't pay my employees
 
07:41:43.510 --> 07:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
i have to pay time and a half after 40
 
07:41:43.520 --> 07:41:44.548 align:start position:0%
i have to pay time and a half after 40
hours

07:41:44.548 --> 07:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
hours
 
07:41:46.468 --> 07:41:46.478 align:start position:0%
there's nothing immoral about straight
 
07:41:48.868 --> 07:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
time but the government has stepped in
 
07:41:51.510 --> 07:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at two exit signs up there
 
07:41:53.910 --> 07:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
government told me to put up those exit
 
07:41:56.388 --> 07:41:56.398 align:start position:0%
signs this is my workplace i had
 
07:41:58.388 --> 07:41:58.398 align:start position:0%
somebody had to put those up
 
07:42:00.788 --> 07:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what you can say to it
 
07:42:04.310 --> 07:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
but it's not i it's a hard argument for
 
07:42:07.910 --> 07:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
me to accept that the government isn't
 
07:42:11.030 --> 07:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
telling us what to do in our workplaces
 
07:42:13.510 --> 07:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
so if you want to comment that's fine
 
07:42:15.430 --> 07:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm maybe just being pranked
 
07:42:16.868 --> 07:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
no thank you representative and i
 
07:42:18.548 --> 07:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate you warning me about your
 
07:42:21.430 --> 07:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
crankiness in advance so um i would like
 
07:42:23.190 --> 07:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
to respond and i'm not suggesting that
 
07:42:24.628 --> 07:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
government has never
 
07:42:27.270 --> 07:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
suggested to businesses um how those
 
07:42:28.628 --> 07:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
businesses should be run we could
 
07:42:31.190 --> 07:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
probably point to a thousand different
 
07:42:31.200 --> 07:42:33.990 align:start position:0%
probably point to a thousand different
regulations

07:42:33.990 --> 07:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
07:42:36.868 --> 07:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
and every single time legislators such
 
07:42:38.868 --> 07:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
as yourself have to
 
07:42:41.430 --> 07:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
make the decision is this in the best
 
07:42:42.868 --> 07:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
interest of the business and the
 
07:42:44.948 --> 07:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
employee or is it not
 
07:42:48.788 --> 07:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that this
 
07:42:48.798 --> 07:42:50.548 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that this
amendment

07:42:50.548 --> 07:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:42:53.430 --> 07:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
is clearly not in the best interest of
 
07:43:00.230 --> 07:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:01.910 --> 07:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
i was kind of hoping you wouldn't be
 
07:43:01.920 --> 07:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
i was kind of hoping you wouldn't be
reasonable

07:43:05.270 --> 07:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:09.350 --> 07:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:11.990 --> 07:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
mr sure yes just maybe a related
 
07:43:14.388 --> 07:43:14.398 align:start position:0%
question to you and that is um
 
07:43:15.990 --> 07:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
how long are we planning on being here
 
07:43:17.830 --> 07:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
today or do you expect to be here today
 
07:43:20.070 --> 07:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
um very shortly
 
07:43:20.080 --> 07:43:21.110 align:start position:0%
um very shortly
um

07:43:21.110 --> 07:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:23.910 --> 07:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that was our last witness
 
07:43:25.990 --> 07:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
and as
 
07:43:28.788 --> 07:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
as chair and as
 
07:43:30.708 --> 07:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment i think i've
 
07:43:31.670 --> 07:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
done a
 
07:43:33.510 --> 07:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeoman's job of holding my tongue
 
07:43:36.070 --> 07:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire hearing
 
07:43:37.830 --> 07:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
and now i'm going to allow myself a
 
07:43:41.910 --> 07:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:41.920 --> 07:43:42.788 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:43:42.788 --> 07:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:43:45.270 --> 07:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
then we will be done
 
07:43:47.110 --> 07:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
the reason that i introduced this
 
07:43:47.120 --> 07:43:48.150 align:start position:0%
the reason that i introduced this
amendment

07:43:48.150 --> 07:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:43:51.270 --> 07:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
was at the behest of
 
07:43:51.280 --> 07:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
was at the behest of
constituents

07:43:53.030 --> 07:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
07:43:57.030 --> 07:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
and in my reading of the constitution
 
07:43:59.510 --> 07:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
i can't find the word business anywhere
 
07:44:02.708 --> 07:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
um but i find i find people individuals
 
07:44:02.718 --> 07:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
um but i find i find people individuals
everywhere

07:44:04.070 --> 07:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
07:44:05.830 --> 07:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
the thought that because it's more
 
07:44:08.708 --> 07:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
convenient or better for business
 
07:44:11.750 --> 07:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
we can force individual citizens
 
07:44:14.868 --> 07:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
to take a medication a
 
07:44:17.430 --> 07:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination an experiment we don't even
 
07:44:20.388 --> 07:44:20.398 align:start position:0%
know what it is at this point
 
07:44:22.468 --> 07:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
because some data looks good
 
07:44:25.190 --> 07:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's in my mind
 
07:44:25.200 --> 07:44:26.788 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's in my mind
reprehensible

07:44:26.788 --> 07:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
reprehensible
 
07:44:29.030 --> 07:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the constitution it just does not
 
07:44:32.468 --> 07:44:32.478 align:start position:0%
drive you cannot make excuses
 
07:44:34.948 --> 07:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
to take people's bodily autonomy away
 
07:44:36.788 --> 07:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
from them
 
07:44:39.590 --> 07:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
because it's for the common good
 
07:44:41.590 --> 07:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
um that's not the constitution doesn't
 
07:44:43.030 --> 07:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
contemplate the common good that
 
07:44:46.150 --> 07:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
contemplates uh individual liberty
 
07:44:50.310 --> 07:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i can't think of anything more
 
07:44:52.628 --> 07:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
intrusive than to tell someone what
 
07:44:54.708 --> 07:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with their body
 
07:44:56.628 --> 07:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
and i you know i i
 
07:44:58.150 --> 07:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm pro-life
 
07:45:01.110 --> 07:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
and um i held through that and i voted
 
07:45:03.190 --> 07:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
against the death penalty and i hope
