the bill
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
SB 103 came out of a request from a
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
constituent to recognize the historic
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
importance of the raid on Fort William
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
and Mary now known as Fort Constitution
 
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:05.660 align:start position:0%
let me take you back December 13th
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
1774 Paul Revere wrote out of Boston to
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
warn the Colonials that the British are
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
coming the British are coming
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
but this was four months before his
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
famous ride to Lexington and Concord
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts his first ride was
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
actually to Portsmouth New Hampshire he
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
carried news that British ships were on
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
the way to secure the powder
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
at Fort William and Mary in Newcastle
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
for the king's use keeping it from the
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary colonists for the Brewing
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
American Revolution
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
at noon on December 14th a crowd of 400
 
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
Colonials from Portsmouth rye and
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
Newcastle marched on the fort which was
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
guarded by a lone British captain and
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
just five Redcoats there was a brief
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
exchange of gunfire some minor injuries
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
and the granite Staters overwhelmed The
 
00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:56.090 align:start position:0%
and the granite Staters overwhelmed The
Garrison

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
Garrison
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
these were the first shots of the
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
American Revolution throughout the day
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the 14th and the 15th the conquerors
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
made off with the military stores
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
eventually Distributing nearly a hundred
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
barrels of gunpowder across New
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this proved vital in the
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary battles to come they
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
actually left the fort before the
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
British reinforcements could arrive
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
in 1791 the fort was renamed Fort
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it actually remained in
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
service as part of our coastal defense
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
through 1948. it's currently a state
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
Historic Site
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
SB 103 was introduced uh as a
 
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
designation day it would have named
 
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
December 14th and 15th as Fort
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
Constitution days now knowing that the
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
house has been well let's say highly
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
skeptical of adding additional days to
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
our annual calendar Senator Bradley
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
suggested that we rework the bill to
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
commemorate the 250th anniversary of the
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
raid on Fort William and Mary which is
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
coming up quickly next year
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
this legislature has already set up a
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
sester centennial commission it's a new
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
word for me sesters Centennial means
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
250th I'm I'm just old enough to
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
remember the bicentennial and I know
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
some of you aren't old enough to
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
remember the bicentennial so the sister
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
centennials commission would commemorate
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
the American Revolution and the
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence
 
00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
this group is currently tasked with
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
planning an event for July 4th 2026 SB
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
103 asked that the commission also
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
marked New Hampshire's vital role in the
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
beginning of our fight for independence
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
this would give the commission a window
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
of 19 months from December 2024 all the
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
way through July 2026 for Education
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
Outreach and events commemorating the
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
American res Revolution
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
there is a drafting error in the bill as
 
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
amended this is my fault on line 14 It
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
should read December 14 2024.
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
I believe it says 2026. so the idea is
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
that we would Mark Fort constitute Fort
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
William and Mary in December 2024 and
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
hold events all the way up through the
 
00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:06.139 align:start position:0%
250th of the signing of the Declaration
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh in July 2026. SB 103 would highlight
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's role in the American
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
Revolution first in the nation if you
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
will and help us Mark its importance
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
from the first shots fired in Newcastle
 
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
all the way to the signing of the
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
Declaration in Philadelphia Senator
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
Perkins quoka thanks you for your
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
consideration and your support of Senate
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
bill 103.
 
00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr blossey so looking at
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
the uh the date correction online I'm
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
looking at line 26 uh it says December
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
14 2024 or 2026 and you're explaining it
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
should say 2024 yes
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
so the actual uh measure in front of us
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh technically needs to be amended yes
 
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
uh technically needs to be amended yes
okay

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.269 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
that's something that could probably
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
happen uh very quickly uh if if we uh is
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
that something that you could check with
 
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.410 align:start position:0%
that something that you could check with
uh

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
yeah if we could uh
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
have that uh Amendment
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
um made uh
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
through OLS however they work so we
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
could uh if you could help us to effort
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
that so that we can we can vote on the
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
right date
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
that would be uh that would be great so
 
00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:28.850 align:start position:0%
that would be uh that would be great so
while

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
uh steyer is working that I there are
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps some questions I have one or two
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh Mr bossy
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
um on line six it refers to the first
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
line six and seven the first shots fired
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
now I I know you're a history guy
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
and famously uh April 19 1775 The Shot
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
Heard the shot heard around the world uh
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
took place in Lexington so I want to get
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
my head around this
 
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
um so the measure we're looking at
 
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
specifically mentions as amended shot
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
the first shots fired
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
so we know shots were fired during this
 
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.509 align:start position:0%
so we know shots were fired during this
action

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.009 align:start position:0%
action
yes

00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh I'll give myself a follow-up and says
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
the shots were not heard around the
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
world and that's what we're trying to
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
fix they may be heard around the world
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
this community Lexington and Concord had
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
a better publicist in Longfellow who
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
wrote the famous poem
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
um about the midnight ride of Paul
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
Revere so Massachusetts has gotten
 
00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
better press on this uh we're hoping to
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
fix this and let people know that the
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
first shots of the American Revolution
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
were actually on Newcastle
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
so with regard to those first shots
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
which may be very significant because
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
they're in the language of the measure
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
and uh which is why I want to
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
confirm that there were shots fired
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
there were no casualties is that correct
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
no I believe there were minor injuries
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
there were no deaths
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay the the British captain seeing
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
himself greatly outnumbered something
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
like 80 to one
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
um briefly resisted there's a musket
 
00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
fire and then he surrendered The
 
00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:10.189 align:start position:0%
fire and then he surrendered The
Garrison

00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
Garrison
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
okay and um again I
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
want to uh while we're waiting for uh
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment to hopefully come back to
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
us on on line 26.
 
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
us on on line 26.
um

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
and I know we have another speaker
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
coming up who maybe Can Shed light on
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
this if the confronting shots were fired
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh nobody was killed or you use term
 
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.210 align:start position:0%
uh nobody was killed or you use term
injuries

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.009 align:start position:0%
injuries
um

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:36.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
wounds casualties I'm not I'm not sure
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
if the wounds were as a result of a
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
musket shot or another injury but there
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
were there were some
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
um minor injuries uh no casualties
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
you also you also mentioned Paul Revere
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I I know I knew Paul Revere was
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
involved with alerting people uh so
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
could you touch on him again real quick
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
so uh what was his role in this uh
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
you already touched on that yeah well it
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
was similar to what happened uh in
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
Lexington and Concord and that he heard
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
he his job was to uh tell people about
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
the intelligence that they had learned
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how that the uh Royal
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
Navy was was sending a ship to reinforce
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
the Garrison at Fort William and Mary uh
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
to secure the gunpowder that's really
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
what the military significance of this
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
was the gunpowder that was on the island
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
um the Colonials didn't have much of a
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
Navy so the fact that the British held
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
the fort itself was not of military
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
significance it was the military stores
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh which were in short supply and uh the
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
Colonials I'm not sure how heard that
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
the British were going to reinforce this
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
Garrison and they thought well we should
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
take that gunpowder now while it's
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
lightly defended and they're only as we
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
said six Redcoats there
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
um so Paul Revere Road North out of
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
Boston Road up to Portsmouth the on the
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
13th on the 14th 400 people got together
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
marched on the fort took the fort and
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
then over the next two days got the
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
gunpowder out and it was distributed uh
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
on the fourth uh the website maintained
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
by the uh state division of natural and
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
cultural resources uh talks about the
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
significance of that gunpowder and how
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
it was just the barrels were distributed
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
across the state for use by the
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary forces so this is
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
fascinating history in the parallels to
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
Lexington and Concord are
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
beyond the shots fired Sean heard shots
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
heard around the world Paul Revere again
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
writing you just said that he wrote up
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
from Boston that that's a pretty good
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
ride uh
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
he had just one horse he I believe he
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
just wrote up on one hand I think he
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
wrote up himself I could be wrong on
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
that but that the the account I heard
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
was that he he wrote up to tell the
 
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
people in Portsmouth that something was
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
happening and then they rallied together
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh with people from the surrounding
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
towns Rye Newcastle Portsmouth and
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
marched on the fort
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh other questions for Mr bossy
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
who's introducing the bill for Senator
 
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.770 align:start position:0%
who's introducing the bill for Senator
Cuoco

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
Cuoco
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
uh represent Rollins
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm a bit a bit of a history buff
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity all right just to
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
know more about the Battle whatever were
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
the British taken prisoner or were they
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
left at the Fort I believe they were let
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
held and then released when the
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
Colonials left I could be wrong and and
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things this uh commission
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
would do is uh help inform me and you
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
and all of us about what actually
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative minion
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
oh is pointing to uh representative the
 
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative from Pentacle yeah having
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
fought in the Revolutionary I thought
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'd tell you my personal eyewitness
 
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.370 align:start position:0%
I'd tell you my personal eyewitness
account

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
um actually uh General Gage's wife was
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
an American and there's some speculation
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
she was actually a spy for the committee
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
of safety in Boston and learned that the
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
general was sending troops to ship to
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth the seas in reinforce Fort
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
William Mary and the committee and
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
safety of Boston heard about it and had
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
Revere leave on December 13th it was a
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
cold and snowy night and ride to
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth to warn them they've got to
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
get the powder out of there because
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's a moratorium on colonists
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
getting particles of the turmoil that
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
was taking place between the United
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
States and England and uh it was only
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
six British soldiers defending the fort
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
and the captain in charge of the fort
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
resisted of first and he was hit with a
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
musket over the head and received some
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
injuries and they took the powder took
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
it up the river on a gundalo to Durham
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
that's where it was held in the news
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
that Bunker Hill later on and
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
um just the one added factors retired
 
00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:00.059 align:start position:0%
U.S Marshal the sheriff of Rockingham
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
County was audited by uh Governor
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
Wentworth to get a posse and seize those
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
that did this and also the powder
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
and that was John Parker who John was
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
the Uncle John Parker Hale and uh

Marshal for New Hampshire appointed by
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%

and uh and I enjoyed my children Judy
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%

excellent history representative thank
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
you for sharing that and uh there was no
 
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.140 align:start position:0%
question for the for
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I'll tell Senator
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
Carson I'm sure the sister Centennial
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
commission would be calling on you uh in
 
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
the next year I was appointed and then
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office realized the
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
appointed two Democrats and I deferred
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
to the other Democrat who's uh
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
much better to serve in that position so
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I'll be doing whatever I can as a
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
layperson thank you so the gentleman
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
from Penacook has pointed out uh that uh
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
his knowledge a Redco was conked in the
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
head with a musket so that there's
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
certainly an injury there but he
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned the gunpowder and being
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
usually a Bunker Hill
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
and very significantly John Stark is is
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh representative shartliff knows uh
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
played a New Hampshire troops under John
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
Stark Colonel at the time John Stark
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
played a very significant role at Bunker
 
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.230 align:start position:0%
played a very significant role at Bunker
Hill

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hill
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
so uh my question to
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
either a view who have some knowledge of
 
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.990 align:start position:0%
either a view who have some knowledge of
this

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
the representative from Penacook said
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
that the gunpowder from this action was
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
used at Bunker Hill uh by the New
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire troops is that fair to say uh
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
uh I'll I'm supposed to ask you so uh
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
I I would refer to the speaker on this
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
one if he has to know
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
yeah the gunpowder was distributed to
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
communities around the Portsmouth area
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
and when Bunker Hill
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
happened in the militia was called out
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
to support actually they called out
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
earlier for what happened in Lexington
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
and Concord and then they stayed in Camp
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
in Boston and it was the New Hampshire
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
militia that used that powder at Bunker
 
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
militia that used that powder at Bunker
Hill

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hill
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
and I and I would suggest that this bill
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
would help
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
um frame that uh the sister Centennial
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
commission right now has a fairly broad
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
mandate to look at whatever aspects of
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
the Revolution it wants in a specific
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
mandate to have an event pegged to the
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
250th of the signing of the Declaration
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
of Independence on July 4th this bill
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
would give it a second uh Benchmark at
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the Revolution and I
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
think would do a good job of focusing on
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's vital role in the
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
revolution the fact that it started in
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
Newcastle and then over the next 17
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
months we could Mark other events in the
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
revolution and New Hampshire's role in
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
them leading up of course to
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.049 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:49.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
I would also like to add that uh
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
December 14 2024 is a Saturday
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and I would anticipate a weekend of
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
events uh in Portsmouth and Newcastle on
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
the 14th and the 15th uh to commemorate
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
this I think it will work out very well
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr bossy I had a message
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
from a former representative former
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
member of this committee with regard to
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
the suster Centennial commission and if
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
that commission is has been meeting as
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
as it was uh intended to do are you uh
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
it has not been very active I think this
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
would help kick-start them and I I know
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion on who was
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
serving and I think this would help get
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
them back together I know Senator Carson
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
is anxious to to get this going sure
 
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you Mr bossy for introducing
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
this uh next we have representative
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
who asked for three minutes and we can
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
give you more than that if you need that
 
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
give you more than that if you need that
representative

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'll use it more than that but
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
um I'll try I'll try to be brief some
 
00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:00.299 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horgan from
 
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 which is
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham which is where the
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
gundalo was parked in it's not the same
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
gundalo that you can see on an adverse
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
point but very similar um and uh
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I yeah see uh first of all I did
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
notice the uh date and I thought maybe
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
that was deliberate because the uh
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
the commission has gone off to a really
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
slow start
 
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.690 align:start position:0%
slow start
um which

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.350 align:start position:0%
um which
um

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
I suppose lots of things are still
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
getting off the slow starts these days
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
but so 2024 is a better day to uh
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the 200th anniversary of the
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
actual incident which is a very key
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
incident in the American Revolution and
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
also I think ironically if I recall
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
correctly the only time there was
 
00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
actually like uh
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
actioned on New Hampshire soil that our
 
00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:47.930 align:start position:0%
actioned on New Hampshire soil that our
troops

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
troops
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
fought in the revolution
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
um a lot of other places but that was
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
the only time we had actual like armed
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
conflict with us in the British right
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
here on the New Hampshire in New
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah the uh
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking it's unnecessary this
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
is like one of the things that I we I
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
assume the commission will be doing and
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's it it has not been very active it
 
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
it's it it has not been very active it
met

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
well the governor signed it and signed
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
it into law I was just looking at dock
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
it I think it was April 11 2022. he had
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
a ceremonial signing which I found out
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
about reading
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
it was on page three of the union leader
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
and the nice picture of him with a
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
couple of ladies from the DAR which uh
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
which I was pleased to see
 
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.730 align:start position:0%
which I was pleased to see
um

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
I would have gone and watched them
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
signed with the lady from the dir had I
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
known about it in advance and they did
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
um so they had an organizational meeting
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
in December and actually on the website
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
the rep who's listed as a chair was uh
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um a rep who's now he was an excellent
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
choice but he's did not run for
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
reelection he's now no longer remember
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
the house although I suppose he can
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
still be a member of the commission so
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
the speaker wants to point a different
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
rep I see uh two
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
I see two excellent choices uh well more
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
than two but two especially excellent
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
choices right here on the other side of
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
the committee table from me so
 
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.930 align:start position:0%
the committee table from me so
um

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
the reason it was sort of odd that I
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
became the sponsor of it I sort of back
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
in back in the summer 2021 I noticed
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
that no one else had done it and when we
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
had the bicentennial wheat appointed a
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
commission a few years out we also have
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
had the bicentennial of the Constitution
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
since then and
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
those are both done um
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
those were done I think I forget the
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
exact days but about five or six years
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
before that and the Crystal Federal
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
sester attends Centennial commission
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
which by the way are Senator Gene
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
Shaheen who at the time was also my
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
constituent but
 
00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:51.299 align:start position:0%
um she's a member of so I just felt like
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
somebody had to introduce the bill so I
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
decided I went ahead and did it and got
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
um several several other co-sponsors
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
including uh representative wall from
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
Madbury who's currently sitting on the
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
commission so uh
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
I uh I certainly uh this is this will be
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
a certainly a specific uh a specific
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
event which may spur the commission onto
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
more on to more more action than it
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
seems to have been taking
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I mean it hasn't been that long since
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
the you know it's only been
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
five months since the organizational
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
meeting but still you know I would have
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
anticipated they would have been meeting
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
much more actively since then and I even
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
put in a thing of the bill for a fund to
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
collect donations and so I I would have
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
expect him to get started a little bit
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
more quickly than they did but I'm sure
 
00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:37.610 align:start position:0%
more quickly than they did but I'm sure
they'll

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
they'll
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll do a good job once they
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
get going and this may be just a
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
specific thing that's not that far away
 
00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:46.130 align:start position:0%
specific thing that's not that far away
that

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
they can start working on organizing and
 
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
I know there's other uh other
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
organizations in the Seacoast area and
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
across the state we would be happy to
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
have helped make that event that event
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
happen on on in December 2024 and the
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
24th 50th anniversary of the uh
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
the Battle of Fort William and Mary or
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it so as for
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
the word sister Centennial
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
um that was what the draft that's what
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
the federal uh
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
commissioned this called and that was
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
what the uh
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
that was what the drafters wanted to
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
call it some strange Latin phrase which
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
I think is one and a half plus it means
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
experially sister means 2.5 so it's two
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
and a half times a century so that's
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
what the sester Centennial is not
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily the word I would have chosen
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is so
 
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.269 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is so
um

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
without be happy to take any questions
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I can't add by the way there were
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
shirtless I think representative
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
shurtliff was a little bit too young to
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
be on active duty in the Revolutionary
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
War but there were some of his relatives
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
who who did fight so thanks yeah
 
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
who who did fight so thanks yeah
yeah

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative this is uh kind
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
of your this is kind of your lucky day
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
because uh we're waiting for that
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to come back thank you yes and
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
this is a chance for you to have extra
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
time okay which uh which I I know you
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
you can utilize Chris they working that
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh and again there are probably a
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
few folks watching at home and we what
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're waiting on is an amendment just to
 
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
change the uh a housekeeping yes we need
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
to change a number or a date on the
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
measure before us
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
um representative you mentioned the DAR
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
is a in for folks watching at home or
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
who watch this later uh I think most of
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
us know what the DAR is and or
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson certainly does uh
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
but could you there's not the dra but
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
the DAR if you could the daughters well
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
the dra would be involved in
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
administering the uh
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
trust fund which I don't know if anybody
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
has donated to it but it is there to be
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
donated but no this is not the
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
this is the Daughters of the American
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
Revolution so it's uh
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
and say uh
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
there's also a sons of the American
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
Revolution but the DAR is much more
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
active organizations so it's uh women
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
whose ancestors
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
fought in the uh fought in the
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
Revolution fought on our side of the
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
Revolution there actually is an
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
organization of Canada called the
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
daughters of the Loyalists for those who
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
are loyal to King George but uh you know
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
not many members of those here in New
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I guess they're welcome to
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
help with any if we had a reenactment I
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
guess they'd be welcome to help recruit
 
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:30.980 align:start position:0%
some reenactments for the uh
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
British Sailors who are on the other
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
side of the conflict but um no see it
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
was the Daughters of the American
 
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.430 align:start position:0%
was the Daughters of the American
Revolution

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought yeah I pretty much
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
knew Dar was wish for that and to
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
qualify to be a member of the DAR you
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to certify your or show that you're
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
a descendant of uh yes of people who
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
were involved in the revolution yes and
 
00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:56.269 align:start position:0%
were involved in the revolution yes and
uh

00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably easier now there's all
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
those as genealogical databases so I've
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
like and it's actually they're uh their
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
directory is actually very valuable
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
resource if you're any for anybody who's
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
chasing their ancestry because like uh
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
the female side of the genealogy is
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
harder to trace but the dir uh
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
beginning the 19th century and
 
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
continuing to the present day has like
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
done a very good job of uh you know
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
recording the history
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
of of the Revolution and how you know
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
and how their uh their descendants are
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay and uh while we're waiting for that
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I have one do you would you
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
believe question representative
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
thank you uh would you believe that my
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
fifth great grandfather whose name is
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
Nathaniel ball senior was the uh first
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of the provincial Congress in
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
1775 the provincial Congress uh
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
Forerunner to what became the New
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature of course they
 
00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:58.940 align:start position:0%
call it the provincial Congress in 1775
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
because we were a province of a colony
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
at that time would you believe that I
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely would believe it so uh you're
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
I guess you're what they call a legacy
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
member so that makes me wonder if I
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
could be a member of the sons of the
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
American Revolution you probably could
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
I've considered it I've actually looked
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
at many many
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
applications profess Sons and Daughters
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
of the revolution from people who are
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
related to me who lived in the 19th and
 
00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:26.179 align:start position:0%
20th centuries so I could probably
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
occasionally consider filling out the
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
paperwork but uh I haven't gotten around
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
to it yet and you could certainly do the
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
same too and the organization still
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
exists and it's still very active both
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
the DAR and SAR or
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
would you believe when I found out that
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
Nathaniel Blount's senior was my fifth
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
grade grandfather who was a provincial
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
Congress leader
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
um that I went to uh Secretary of State
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
Gardner when I find this out I said uh
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
secretary do you know anything he's a
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
historian of course and I asked if he
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
knew anything about Nathaniel Ball's
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
senior and he said he would find out and
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
so on the very last day of session in
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
night in 2017 he gave me a folder of
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
information on Nathaniel Ball's senior
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
my fifth grade grandfather and
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
apparently he was among other things on
 
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
the committee back then that was tasked
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
with finding out ways to tax out of
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
Staters and this was in 1775 so
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
obviously my fifth grade grandfather was
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
a man ahead of his time yes would you
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
believe that oh yes and my final
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
question uh representative uh would you
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
believe that Nathaniel Ball's senior's
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
son who was Nathaniel balls Jr signed up
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
for stickney's militia in 1777 and
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
fought with John Stark at Bennington
 
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:45.140 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I believe that
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
you mentioned representative wall uh who
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
is is she one of your constituents as
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
well or um she well
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
she still works with us closely they
 
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.770 align:start position:0%
she still works with us closely they
actually

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
drew the district line so bad very
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
Durham where for the first time possibly
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
since uh Nathaniel Paul Senior and
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
Junior remembers of legislature Top
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
members of the part of the same district
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
but uh yes but she was at the time too
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
she also apparently had ancestors who
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
fought in the revolution at Bennington
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
um yeah she mentioned the stick knees I
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
think so they there's yes he's he has my
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
fourth great grandfather signed up for
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
stickney's militia in July of 1777 the
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
next month was Bennington so they didn't
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
have a lot of training at that time
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
apparently you get your musket and off
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:35.690 align:start position:0%
you win other questions for the for the
representative

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the sake of not
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh holding people here for
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
if we don't need to the amendment the
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
amending language that we're waiting on
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll be an amendment that would
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
have an H after it
 
00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:16.940 align:start position:0%
um would simply change on line 26
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
the date of 2026 to 2024.
 
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.250 align:start position:0%
the date of 2026 to 2024.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do is
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
have a we would be looking for a motion
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
and to have a motion
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
to accept the amending language and then
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
we could vote on the measure as amended
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh so in anticipation the actual
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendment number hopefully coming from
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
