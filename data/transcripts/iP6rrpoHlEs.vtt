00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:58.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody it is
 
00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
901 so let's get started because we have
 
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
a lot to discuss here this morning this
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
is the Monday April 29th edition of the
 
00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we will begin as usual by all rising
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
and joining representative Kaplan as he
 
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the flag United States of
 
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
America to the for which it stands one
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
nation God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 align:start position:0%
all okay it looks like a light agenda
 
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
with only two items on it
 
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
a full committee work session starting
 
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
right now and then an exec session
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
thereafter but in fact I think this is
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a complicated work session
 
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot to discuss about
 
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
595 this is a complicated looking bill
 
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
but it basically comes down to one thing
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
resolution the reason for the bill is
 
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
because today if there's a dispute
 
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
between somebody who owns a pole and
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to attach to that
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
pole if there's a dispute about the
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
contract for
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
process that involves six
 
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
different uh factors to try to come to a
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
dispute these factors however are vague
 
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.509 align:start position:0%
dispute these factors however are vague
and

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
imprecise and essentially mean that
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
there will never be a just resolution to
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
this to the
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
dispute so this bill was introduced to
 
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
come up with to replace that six Factor
 
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 align:start position:0%
resolution process with
 
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
something better and that something
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
better is a
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
Formula based on an FCC formula that's
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
been in existence for a long
 
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
time so this bill wants the department
 
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
to through a stakeholder process
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
establish what that formula should be
 
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
state and and then put it in place so
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
that in the case of any future dispute
 
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
between a pole attachment owner and or a
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
pole owner and an attachment applicant
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
that there will be a way to resolve that
 
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 align:start position:0%
dispute that
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
is uh fully understood actually
 
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.870 align:start position:0%
is uh fully understood actually
works

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
and gets to a place where the dispute
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
do the problem is we're not sure that we
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
have the steps to get there based on the
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
way the bill is
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh I've been given a series of
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
questions that I can't really answer and
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to throw some of these out
 
00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
find out if members of the committee can
 
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.990 align:start position:0%
find out if members of the committee can
answer

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
questions questions like how does senate
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
Bell 595 expedite the pole attachment
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
process how does SB 595 impact pole
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
 
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
replacement where is the transparency in
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
the new process since it's non
 
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.790 align:start position:0%
the new process since it's non
adjudicatory

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
does SB
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
595 shift
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
costs why is the legislature effectively
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
eliminating or overriding private
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
contracts why is the legislature
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
favoring government mandates for rates
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
for attachers versus private contracts
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
between pole owners and
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
attachments is Senate Bill 595 an
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional government
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
taking and believe it or not there's
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
line what these questions reveal to me
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
is that there's still a lot about this
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
process that we just
 
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.950 align:start position:0%
process that we just
don't

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
understand we know what it's trying to
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
do it's trying to come up with a new
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
process for dispute resolution but does
 
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
it do that and does it do it effectively
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
that is the question so what I would
 
00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
like to hear from Members who've had a
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
study this legislation who've had a
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
chance to think about it who've had a
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to people and ask
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions what are your thoughts about
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation and is it in a place
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
where we can move it forward either
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
date representative Vice chair Thomas uh
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
um if you're hearing some of those
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
questions and talking to just a couple
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
of people um I know it always seems to
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
be within our nature to want to fix a
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
perceived issue we it seems like we uh
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
as as legislators we we we want to look
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
at something that that someone brings
 
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
forward to us as a potential problem and
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's reticent to us to say well
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's not our job I think we can try
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
and fix it but in this case i' I'm kind
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
of wondering um after hearing those
 
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:01.879 align:start position:0%
questions and you know hearing you speak
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh this has become a very convoluted
 
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.189 align:start position:0%
uh this has become a very convoluted
Bill

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
and to what end is this really going to
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
help the problem I don't know I don't
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
think I have enough information to know
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
if this is really going to help the
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
problem I know we're trying to it seems
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
like it could but there's some doubt
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
so has the cop
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
so oh we have copies
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
oh I'll just take
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
Doug sorry about that like the hen young
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
of yes I know uh so um so one question I
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
have is why did it take so long for this
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
issue even to come up I think the uh uh
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
this uh current process we had has been
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
around for like you know several years I
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
like to hear more about why it took so
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
long for this come up I also like to
 
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.030 align:start position:0%
long for this come up I also like to
hear

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
about uh whether this formula really
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
will help the Pu or not like to hear
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
people okay thank you for those comments
 
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.269 align:start position:0%
people okay thank you for those comments
representative

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chair um I um I I I
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
think that um this bill is um deserving
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
of real interim study real further study
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I I I spent some time over the
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
weekend just trying to sort through um
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
what I understand is going on and if uh
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me I'd like to just share
 
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
kind of what I what I found um the
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
um um you know the the Pu established um
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
some administrative rules it's pu
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
1300 which is um consistent with the
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
current stat statute um and the and the
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
centerpiece of those rules are standards
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
that the commission uses to um consider
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
in a case by casee uh I can never
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
pronounce the word right a judicative
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
hearing um um and there are specific um
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
considerations that they need to look at
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh what what this bill would do in a
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
sense would eliminate those
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rules um as I understand
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
it and replace it with a form formulaic
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
approach that would apply to all parties
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
um independent of the
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances um the proponents of the
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill argue that it will increase
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
transparency and predictability and they
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
also noted that you know we are the only
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
state New England that does not use the
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
FCC formula or a version thereof but the
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
opponents of the bill argue that the on
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
size fits-all approach has will have
 
00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
negative impact on their ability to
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
generate the revenues they need to to
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
maintain polls um and it could it could
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
possibly impact their ability to remain
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
competitive and provide needed services
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
in the uh areas that they serve which I
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
think tend to be more remote than than
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
than not um and and the you know the the
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
fact is at least from my perspective we
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
really don't know what the impact is um
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
you know what we do know is that
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh s SP 595 is supported by the New

are the smaller local or Regional

organizations um it's it's worth noting
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
that on August 22nd of
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
2022 Charter Breeze line and Comcast
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
filed a petition with the Pu for
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
resolution of a rate dispute against
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
Consolidated uh regarding annual poll
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
attachment rates and Joint use charges
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
um they asked the Pu to resolve the
 
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.790 align:start position:0%
um they asked the Pu to resolve the
dispute

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh using the process that's reflected in
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
the current statute RSA 374
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
34A on February 17th of
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
2023 the Pu issued a ruling in its order
 
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.550 align:start position:0%
2023 the Pu issued a ruling in its order
number

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
26 comma
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
775 that the joint and and the Pu rule
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
that the joint use charge imposed by
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
Consolidated is
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable uh and that they should
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
cease imposing those charges but the but
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
the Pu also ruled that the petitioners
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
charter breez line and Comcast did not
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
meet the burden of proof to demonstrate
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
that the existing pole attachment rates
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
charged by Consolidated are either
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
unjust or unreasonable and therefore the
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
rate should remain in effect so in a
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
sense they lost their part of the
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
petition uh passing s SB
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
595 would give those petitioners another
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple so to speak because it
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
would replace the criteria that the Pu
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
used to make their judgment with a with
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
a formula um and while there may be some
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
benefits in terms of transparency and
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
predictability um I at least would feel
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
better if I had a better sense of what
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
the impact of the change would be um on
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the remaining local providers that will
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
be affected by this
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
approach um and you know rather than
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
rush into this I would rather we
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
referred this to interim study and at
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
the same time ask someone the doe the Pu
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
the affected companies to provide us
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
with an analysis of what the rates under
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
this new formula would be um you know
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that uh the impact would
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
be minor and and
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
inconsequential um and we've really
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
haven't talked a lot about the impact on
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
rates to eversource Unitil and Liberty
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
who are large pole owners um and again
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard that the the impact on rates
 
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:34.759 align:start position:0%
would be minimal but in the words of
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
Ronald Reagan I'd rather trust but
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
verify before we jump into something so
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
um you know I
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
I it I think it's it's it's it's worthy
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
of of further study um and I just think
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
that uh it would be premature to act at
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
this point and hopefully that has helped
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative muns good
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
comments very helpful yes representative
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington just just a little in in way
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
of background on this this is not a new
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
issue the pole the pole Wars as where I
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
guess they would refer to at one time
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
have been going on for I'm aware of
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
since at least the early 2000s maybe
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
before that and a couple of things need
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
to note originally this was all set up
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
back in the days when we had basically
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
two types of companies there was a
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
regulated telephone company and a
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
regulated Electric Company both of which
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
had poles and they allowed things to be
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
attached but back in the day there was
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
not many attachments that was before
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
cable TV and internet and every other
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
wire that's hanging on there right now
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the world is definitely changed the
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
other thing we need to be aware of is
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
that if there's an additional cost or
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue or whatever associated
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
with the polls owned by the telephone
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
company by the electric companies that's
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
a charge that they can pass through to
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
rate payers because of a regulated
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
utility the telephone companies no
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
longer fit in that decision they're
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
basically got to go out and compete in
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
the market so what they pay if they have
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
to pay more they're going to have to
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
raise their rates or or lose profits so
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
this we got to recognize that there's a
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
difference between the two uh people
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
that own the polls and lastly there's a
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
lot of other issues with polls besides
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
cost I mean I for example I can give you
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
one from my town for over a year uh
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
every weekend when people drive to the
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
dump you go by a pole that's about 3 ft
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
long hanging in the air suspended by
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
wires and no one seems to be able to get
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
around to put those wires onto the new
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
telephone pole they just hang there and
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
everyone keeps saying why don't you get
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
that fixed well I've tried and no one
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
seems to want to be able to fix it and
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
recently now with all these down Poes
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of weeks in storms
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
you you see more and more of these and
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
like I say they can be hanging there for
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
years they're not electric wires they're
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
only communication wires the lower ones
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
on the pole so so there's other issues
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
associated with this I understand that
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
the cost issue people want to get
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
resolved upfront so they especially with
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
expansion of um internet service I think
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of federal money for that
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh they want to get this this is fixed
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
but I just want to let people know that
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
there it's kind of two separate cases
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
one for telephone polls that are own by
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
telephone companies and one for
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
telephone polls that are own by electric
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
companies and I'm not sure how we
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
address that because it's clearly the
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
financing is clearly different where one
 
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799 align:start position:0%
can go to the Pu and say I've got to pay
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
I'm making less money on my telephone
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
pole rentals now so I'm going to have to
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
make up that money someplace else where
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the telephone company can only say I'm
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
making less money on my uh telephone
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
pole rental so I'm going to have to
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
raise prices or low lower profits two
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
different cases I just want people to be
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
that thank you I'd remind members that
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
there are members of both sides of this
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
um on on this bill here today and I will
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
allow asking questions
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
if anybody has questions that they want
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
to ask representative Thomas thank you
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
um when the consumer Advocate was uh
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bill he testified
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
that he wanted it to go to interim study
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
and when I asked him specifically why
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
interm study and not just kill the bill
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
he noted inconsistency in disputes best
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
public policy excuse me and have to get
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
cost allocations correct
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
um and then when I asked how many poll
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
disputes have occurred on a yearly basis
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
I was told there were two cases that
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
were adjudicated in 12 years so this
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
this may or may not be a
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
problem if it is a problem it sounds
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
like it's a it's a big problem that
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to look at many
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
pieces and I don't think going to interm
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
study at this point in the in the term
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
is the correct thing I think we should
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
kill the bill and bring it back next
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
year in the first year and then take a
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
good look at
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you I would like to Echo
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bun's comments
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
that it's really kind of hard to see
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
what the effect of this change would be
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
without some numbers I'd like to see
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
some numbers what's a what's a rate
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
today what's a rate going to look like
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
after this change is made we have seen
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
no information of that sort in this uh
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the runup to this to this bill so far
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGee had some
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
comments thank you Mr chairman I didn't
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
know you saw me over here um I was just
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
looking back on some I always see you oh
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I was just looking back
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
over some notes and um one of the
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that uh folks seem to have is
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
that we have sort of a diverse market
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
right we have larger players and then we
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
have smaller players and and uh and we
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
we were concerned very much about that
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
competition and preserving the
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
competition and not making rules that
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
would Advance uh you know one provider
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
versus another um we did have testimony
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire telephone Association
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
and Granite State Communications in
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill saying that the
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
FCC formula already generate uh is
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
generous uh toward
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
attachers um and that they were
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that they might be shifting to
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
customers and
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
um they they basically said that the
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
existing mechanism for resolving
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
disputes which is based uh the Pu bases
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
it on the FCC formula as a starting
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
point for looking at whether the private
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
contracts are just and reasonable that
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
those are working well so you know with
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
all the other stuff that's been said
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
already the other question is why do we
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
need to do this because our Market may
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
not be the same as as uh some other
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
markets in New England and again we
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't have that information in order to
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
apply it get to the decision of whether
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
we want to pass the
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
Bill representative
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you you know as I think
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
about this you know I think this is
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
really for when there's a dispute most
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
of the time everything's done with
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
private contracts and as representative
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas pointed out we've had what two
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
disputes in 12 years and everything else
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
apparently has been just settled by
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
private agreement so that leads me to
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
think you know it's really not that big
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
a deal and you know maybe we should just
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
go with the FCC formula but then you
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
know they're removing parts so that if
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
we do make the change if we go say with
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
the FCC formula then maybe some of the
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
private agreements don't become private
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
agreements and they go to adjudication
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
because one of the parties feels like
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
they're better off with the FCC
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
formula um so that's one of the concerns
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
I have just about the moving parts and
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
adjudications the devil's in the details
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
as they always say correct it is
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
possible that the low number of um
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
disputes that have occurred in the last
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
12 years is a direct result of the
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
inadequacy of the current uh six- Factor
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
test as they call it in resolving
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
disputes so people don't even bring them
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
because they know that it's going to be
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
kind of useless um to bring them forward
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
so that is a possibility one that I
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
think needs to be
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
investigated representative Ms thanks Mr
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
chairman um you know just following up
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
on Representatives corman's point I mean
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
I think there might even be some around
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
um private
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
agreements um there might even be some
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
concern with the way the bill is written
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
right now that um it could eliminate
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
these private agreements that the
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
formula could
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
suede um a a private agreement um and um
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that would be something
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
we'd want to make sure we understood
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
better representative
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair um I agree
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot we we we need to find
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
out before we can make a decision about
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
this bill but I I just want to bear in I
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
want us to bear in mind that uh the at
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the day the our constituents
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
need better service in terms of third
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
party providers and internet providers
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the state and uh one of the things
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
that might be holding that back is the
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
the legal framework around these private
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
contracts at the present so you know
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
that we might need some kind of
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
resolution that isn't apparent just
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
because we've only had two cases in the
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
last 12
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
years representative
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you chair I says long as
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
everybody else's way and I thought it
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
would do the same I'm in full support of
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
everything that's been said uh sending
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
this to uh interm study and also the
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
financial note concerns me we're talking
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
about one position I realize it's small
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
dent in our budget but when we have so
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
many other committees crying out or so
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
many other do the Department of
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services like uh
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
complaining about Staffing shortages I
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
just think we ought really parse this
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
before we just jump on the bandwagon for
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
support representative Harrington yeah
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I had on this um was
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
the very end of the amendment uh on
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
starting on line 29 when it talks about
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
well I'll just read the whole thing
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
within 30 days following the close of
 
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
the Department's non- adjudicative
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
proceeding the commission shall conduct
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
formal rulemaking to incorporate the
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
formula developed by the department into
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
its rules to adopt accelerated so forth
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
and so on um it appears to say that the
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
doe is going to come up with rules with
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
with some type of a proceeding that's
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to come up with some type of
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
formula they're going to hand it over to
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
the Pu and say this is the rule uh this
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
is what we have to do now you must
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
incorporate this into your rules uh are
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
we giving the Pu discretion at all it's
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
not clear to me if they can look at it
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
and say well we disagree with part of
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
that and we think there should be
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
something different so uh I don't I
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's been clarified is
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
this that's what you're looking at
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
before we discuss that specific issue I
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
just passed out the amendment I hadn't
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
passed it out earlier here because uh it
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
hadn't come up yet but since you brought
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
it up representative Harrington I have
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
passed out the amendment everyone will
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
now have a copy of it and can evaluate
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not the question that
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is asking yeah
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just not clear what that implies
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we've this I know
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
we're breaking new ground with a lot of
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
this because you know we in the past it
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
would have been the Pu would have done
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
the whole shebang on this but now you
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
have it appears to have the doe coming
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
up with a policy that they give to the
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
Pu and say put this into rules and it's
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
not clear to me if they can look at it
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
and say well that really doesn't work we
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
have to make some adjustments or is it
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
just a you know we going to make we're
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to get your main idea in there but
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
we can make changes or is it here's the
 
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
rules word for word you put here's the
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
here's the policy put it in the rules
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
and you have no discretion to make any
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
changes it's to me it's not clear it's a
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
new it's a new process
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
right okay I had not St started a
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of the amendment yet because
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
I thought we were we needed to fully
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
understand the big picture of the bill
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
before we got to to that point but since
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
you've sort of initiated an
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
investigation a discussion about the
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment we can now go there and
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
um so let me just introduce the
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
amendment by saying that basically what
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
it does is it adds a new
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
section a section five that starts on
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
line 20 and goes through lines
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
25 that provides an
 
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.070 align:start position:0%
25 that provides an
offramp

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
offramp
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
to carriers that allows a rate to be
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
phased in over 10 years at 10% per
 
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.630 align:start position:0%
phased in over 10 years at 10% per
year

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
and is a possible way to deal with some
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
of these issues but it may not be an
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
adequate way so that's the introduction
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and we can discuss it
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
now or we can continue discussing the
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
bill from a high level either way
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative buns um I'd just like to
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
come back to um a point that
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan made uh regarding
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
um deployment of um Broadband I think
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
that's what you were you were getting at
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
um and and that was something that we
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
had heard in in testimony it was
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
something that I was concerned about
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
because um the last thing we want to do
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
is have rates that get in the way of
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
doing that but I when I was doing my
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
research over the weekend I I did note
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
that I did notice that in the current pu
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
standards the the six Factor tests that
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
they use one of the tests is the
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
potential impact on deployment of
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
broadband services so um I think that at
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
least is getting some consideration as
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
process okay who's next representative
 
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.830 align:start position:0%
process okay who's next representative
Thomas

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to be high here well
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
high level um sorry um so uh when
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
eversource was testifying I specifically
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
asked if they were unhappy with the pole
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
dispute process prior to the case that
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
initiated this bill and they said
 
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
no so I'm not sure if we're looking for
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
a solution to a problem that may or may
 
00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
a solution to a problem that may or may
not

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
exist representative
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair so uh as I
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
understand this bill um I think uh
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington put his finger
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
on one of the key issues those uh
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities like uh eversource
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
and whatnot um can pass their fees off
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
for any kind of pole attachment
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
issues no problem so what really is an
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
issue here is now independent telephone
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
companies largely smaller ones having to
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
deal with uh
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
applications uh to put Broadband
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
services on their
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
polls uh and and those are in generally
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
less well served areas now because in
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
well served areas most of those Services
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
exist so it's largely in the uh in in
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
the more rural uh communities and the
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
question is how do you define Define
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
what is a legitimate cost
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
for uh that Arena as opposed to the rest
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the Arena out there which you know
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
the ever sources of the Unitil or
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
Liberty have have well covered um I I uh
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
I agree with the chairman that what we
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
don't know are the costs particularly in
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
those two areas new Broadband Services
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
coming into underserved areas and small
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
electric utilities owning a certain
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
number of poles um how how does moving
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
from the six Factor test to the FCC Test
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
impact uh revenues and and ability to
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
survive as the pole owning company so I
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
I think we need to understand that um
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
what whether that be uh information that
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
we asked doe to collect or we do an
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
interim study on I I you know I'm
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
ambivalent uh but I think that's the
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
Grist that this bill is really trying to
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
churn thank you representative McGee
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so bring us back
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
to the uh Amendment and I wanted to draw
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
our attention to section six uh which is
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
on line 26 it says the formula shall
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
exclude from actual capital and non-
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
capital cost reimbursements from
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
attaching entities for non-recurring
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
costs and I looked at that and I'm like
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
I something may be wrong with me but I
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure uh I understand that
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to give guidance here and
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
that uh we're also uh have an FN on the
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
original bill because the doe doesn't
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
really have the subject matter expertise
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
to make these determinations and so
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to hire somebody
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
to help them figure it out so again I'm
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
really just wondering you know what what
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
what exercise we're trying to pursue
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
here uh to follow up really on on uh
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas's Point are
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
we trying to solve something that really
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't need solving it's it's it seems
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
to be in the eye of the beholder right
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
we've had conflicting testimony on
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
and representative McGee to follow up on
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
your comment there what is the
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
definition of nonrecurring
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
costs we don't even know what that is
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
muns um with with respect to the the
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and specifically the Clause
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's being added the new section five
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
um well I think that's a a noble attempt
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
to try to to try to soften the impact um
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
the fact is that um it it's it it
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything about the fact that
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
over the course of uh a specific period
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
of time those smaller um players are
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
going to be are going to suffer a net
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
loss in Revenue that that has to be
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
replaced um so it it it it gives them a
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to get adjusted but
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
all right well let's discuss what our
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
options are
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
here it seems to me
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
that one of our options is interim study
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
interim study however
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
implies that you would invest some time
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
and energy into actually trying to study
 
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.909 align:start position:0%
and energy into actually trying to study
the

00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
issue because at the end of the interim
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
study process you're supposed
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
to pass judgment on a recommendation and
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
that recommendation would either be do
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
not recommend for further legislation or
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
recommend for further
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
legislation so interim study is going to
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
require some some time and
 
00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
require some some time and
effort

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not certainly wouldn't argue
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
that we are incapable of putting in such
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
time and effort but I just want
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
everybody to be aware that that would be
 
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.389 align:start position:0%
everybody to be aware that that would be
Our

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
Our
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
obligation another option here it seems
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
to me and we may want to have a short
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about this is to ask the
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
investigation of this issue and we can
 
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.310 align:start position:0%
investigation of this issue and we can
provide

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
them with a substantial list of
 
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions to
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
answer so that I would think would be a
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
potential option here as well the third
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
option would be to pass the bill as it's
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
written with or without an amendment and
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
see what
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
happens there's a fourth option okay
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
let's hear the fourth option just kill
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
it okay kill it that is a fourth option
 
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.430 align:start position:0%
it okay kill it that is a fourth option
good

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.109 align:start position:0%
good
point

00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so given those four options
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
give me some uh idea of what you'd like
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
to see representative Harrington this is
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
more of a question I know if you look at
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it talks about the Pu
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
having to hire somebody because let's
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
face it there's no one there with
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
telephone expertise anymore they're all
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
gone um and and to uh put this into
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
practice but we don't mention anything
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
about the department of energy I assume
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have anybody that's an expert
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
in telephone poll attachments or
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
anything to do with telephone because
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
they're gone as well they never were
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
there so did is it going to require a
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
doe if we uh if we pass the bill as it
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
is or similar to this it requires the
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
doe to go out and do stuff are they
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
going to have to hire an outside
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
consultant for this and if we instead
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
just give Mista questions and have them
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
go do stuff are they going to have to
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
hire an outside consultant to do it as
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
well I don't see where they have the
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
resources I don't know maybe from doe
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
can speak on that but I would think they
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
would have to go outside of their
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
present staff and at least hire someone
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
on a contract
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
basis would the doe be willing to make
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
some kind of a comment about that
 
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.910 align:start position:0%
some kind of a comment about that
possibility

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
without making a commitment certainly
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
but uh just give us an indication of
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
what logistically might be involved in
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
pursuing a doe
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you so it is true I
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
can't commit to being able to do it um
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
if the department did open uh an
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
investigative proceeding to answer the
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
questions that you send to us uh we
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
would most likely have to hire a
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
consultant to help us sift through that
 
00:37:10.119 --> 00:37:11.630 align:start position:0%
consultant to help us sift through that
um

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
and get as much information as we could
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
from poll owners um those are entities
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we have jurisdiction over we don't
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily have any jurisdiction over
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
attach right so no real ability to
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
compel them to answer questions and
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
provide us with information
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
so I I assume some of them would want to
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
cooperate um to be able to answer those
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
questions but I don't can't guarantee
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they will and we really have no
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism to require them
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
to okay good representative McGee has a
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr shulock for taking my question my
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
question is whether you're aware of any
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
problem with the current process as it
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
is because we've kind of debated back
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
and forth whether there's a need for
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill to pass and whether it's a you
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
know burning need that we have to find a
 
00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
know burning need that we have to find a
solution

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
for I've only heard the same testimony
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
that you have I worked at the Pu for
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
years and years and the the number of
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
poll disputes
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
were you can count them on one hand
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
really representative Ms you have a
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
question for Mr sh yes Mr chair thank
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
um if we were to ask you ask the
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
department to complete a study how long
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
would that
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
take uh that that's really hard to say I
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
mean we would have to hire a consultant
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
that process in and of itself is nine
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
months at the State of New Hampshire 6
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
to n months you have to leave a RFP out
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
on the market for eight weeks is the uh
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
governor and council's preferred time uh
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
plus there's time to develop the RFP to
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
um score the RFP to develop the contract
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
and you know you add that all together
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
and you're at least 6 months out uh
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
before you can really begin and then how
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
long that
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
takes depends on the cooperation that
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
you get from the people you don't have
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over and what the expert
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
believes you need to collect for
 
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
information so hard to
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
say representative Kaplan did you have a
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
question for Mr shulock no I didn't have
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
a question for Mr shulock I'm just a
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
comment thank you
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
did you have another yeah I mean I I can
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
just say in my comment that if if we did
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
our own interim study on on the same
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
issue the um the challenge of getting
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
hard numbers which is what we'd want to
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
get would be the same for us as it would
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
be for the Department of
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
energy representative Corman thank you
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just following up on this new pu
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
position and it's calling for an
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
additional full-time
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
position and I'm wondering why an
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
additional full-time position would be
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
needed to develop a formula that then is
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
used and we still need to actually have
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
this person on staff after that this
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
seems like much more than necessary why
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
consultant I don't know the answer to
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
that question does anybody
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh who is in attendance here today have
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
question Mr Beamer who's currently with
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
the SEC and the puc is shaking his head
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
he has no
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
answer thank
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
you good afterno for the record my name
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
is Mora Weston I represent necta and
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'll have you introduce yourself Sean
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chman Sean
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
Carroll with Comcast and um representing
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
well I gather that you're speaking about
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
the fiscal
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
note that yes yes had um that fiscal
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
note was attached to the bill as
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
introduced in the Senate that bill
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
looked very different than the bill in
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
front of you today and in fact this is
 
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
front of you today and in fact this is
no

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
longer uh under the um workload or
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the Pu but rather the
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy and in the Senate I
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
believe the department of energy
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
testified that they have the current
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
that they have resources currently to be
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
able to undertake this process and that
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is now irrelevant that's
 
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.390 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is now irrelevant that's
my

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
understanding okay well that clears that
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
sure and while we're here um
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
representative McGee had a very specific
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
question about I believe section six of
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think Sean can quickly
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
answer that for
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
you sure thank you um yeah thank thank
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
you for the question so um section six
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
is largely focused on Make Ready costs
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
which are the costs that a new attacher
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
pays to get on polls um so those costs
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
are not where the formula takes into
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
account a poll owner's maintenance costs
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
and other costs the the Make Ready costs
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
which are non-recurring um are are not
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
in the formula so they are they are
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
withheld from the formula one onetime
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
costs to get on the poll um and this
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
language is actually taken verbatim or
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
certainly very close from um the federal
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
FCC regulation on their on their
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
formula good thank you for that
 
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.069 align:start position:0%
formula good thank you for that
clarification

00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh thank you I
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up on what you
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
said so that section six the formula
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
shall exclude so you're talking about
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
the cost for the carrier to the
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
communications carrier let's say to
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually physically get somebody in a
 
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
truck out in the field and attach their
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
wire to the pole that cost will not be
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the formula that that's
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
correct yeah a new attacher will pay
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
full Make Ready costs to to get on the
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
pool and reimburse the poer for all
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
those costs now okay so I when you I
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
understand the simple concept would be
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
why would anyone think let's say Comcast
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
wants to attach a uh cable line to an
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
eversource telephone pole why would ever
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
Source charge them for the uh their cost
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
to do that but what if there's a
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
situation where other people's lines
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
have to be moved who pays for that cost
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's a new attacher as well any cost
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
incurred by by the pole owner or any
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
existing attacher the new attacher will
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
reimburse all those costs so those are
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
outside of the formula then that's
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
correct yeah okay thank you
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for for taking my
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
question uh we have the the notion that
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
this is about dispute arbitration um but
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about the background in
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the penetration of third- party
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
providers in our state as opposed to
 
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and whether the legal
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
framework that we're talking about here
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
has had a role in in in m in making a
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
difference uh between us and our
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in terms of
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
penetration of broadband say do you have
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
an idea about that yeah thank you for
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
the question um I think theoretically it
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
could I mean when speaking for Comcast
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
if we're looking to expand a network
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
into a new municipality new territory
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's largely a an economic question can
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
we get enough subscribers to cover our
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
costs for that expansion and baked into
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
that economic question is recurring pole
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
attachment costs that we pay annually uh
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
to the poll owner in those new
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities so um I don't know if I
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
can say directly that has a direct
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
correlation but certainly at least
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
indirectly there's a there's an economic
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
issue there and the higher a pole
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
attachment rate the less likely that um
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
that comc I would assume any provider
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
would expand because it's harder to
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
recover those construction
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
costs further questions for these folks
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah um the first
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
question is around that back to item six
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
again would it make would it make it
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
clear in the bill if the intent is to
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
exclude Make Ready costs if it said that
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
more specifically I know you said this
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
language was taken directly from
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
FCC uh but it does seem a bit convoluted
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of what you're trying to get
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
at I think we could certainly look at
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
that I'd have to go back to FCC Juris
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
Prudence on on this regulation see what
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
else besides Make Ready um that maybe
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just not thinking of at the
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
moment frankly but I think we could
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
certainly take a look at that make it
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
can I have a followup of course the
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
other thing that struck me um as you
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
were speaking about the costs of trying
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
to expand is that there seem to be
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that are pushing for
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
Broadband everywhere so how does that
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
play into the calculation of assisting
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
you when you're trying to expand in an
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
area where we're trying to get broadband
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
and there are not as many customers and
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
not not the kind of density that you
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
would see in other areas where that cost
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis would be simple sure
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so the there are federal dollars
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
certainly coming in to to the state and
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
to all over the country those Grant
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
programs cover the construction and the
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
Make Ready they they don't cover the re
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
recurring uh attachment rental costs um
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity so um even we we are able
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
to put bid in that covers or counts for
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
our construction cost but those bids
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
don't account for uh these recurring
 
00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:09.270 align:start position:0%
don't account for uh these recurring
attachment

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
fees representative
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh I got it papovich Miller M thank you
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you I just wanted to
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
briefly speak in regards to that section
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
six um I know that I'm a guest here but
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
as an engineer and that also had a PA
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
license um I just want to point out that
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
that language actually when it comes to
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
accounting gabig it's as concise and
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
clear as it can be it's actually very
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
nicely SP written because it doesn't get
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
into specific categories what we call
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
make ready today we could call it by
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
another term if we start putting those
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
terms into legislation and then the
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
terminology changes that could
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
essentially change what we meant to do
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
so this is as clean as it gets and I
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
would suggest is
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
that we should kind of leave it be
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
because any tampering with it could have
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of unintended consequences thank
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
you good good point thank you all right
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ms um if if I could get
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
back to the um I think four op four
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
possible paths that we identified yes um
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you folks thank you unless you
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
have something else you would like to
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
add I do I I think that there are a
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that were raised um
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
in your discussion
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
and particularly having sha here with
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
his regulatory expertise we might be
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
able to help address quickly and clarify
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'll jump in and I'll ask Sean to
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
to pick up in the details because he's
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
our expert um I just want to make clear
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about in this
 
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is what happens in the event
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
of a dispute frankly between uh an a
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
poll owner and an attacher and with the
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
Telecom companies they're competitors of
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
the attachers I think that that's
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
important to note and you all sort of
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
talked about how this is a diverse
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
Market because you have the Telos and
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
the electrics um so what I want to
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
mention is that that all supports
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
frankly the difference to the FCC
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
formula and Sean has expertise in this
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
area but I will quote uh an FCC or order
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
the FCC has stated that the cable rate
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
formula sets just in reasonable poll
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
attachment rates because it is designed
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
in a manner that is fully consistent and
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
transparent with respect to the
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
principles of cost causation and
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
economically efficient pricing is fully
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
compensatory to the pole owner and can
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
be applied in a simple expeditious and
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
unified manner so I just wanted to bring
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
your attention to that because I believe
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
that the conversation here
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
supports uh deference to a formula that
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
has been determined to be fully
 
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
has been determined to be fully
compensatory

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
compensatory
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
Sean thank you and and I'll just add on
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
the formula it's I heard um the the term
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
one size fits all earlier and well the
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
formula itself is a single formula for
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
all poll owners the inputs to that
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
formula are very specific to each
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual poll owner and it accounts
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
for their specific poll inventory their
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
spef specific poll costs um so it it is
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
modeled and it is uh specific to each
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
individual poll owner um and and I heard
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
in in testimony a gentleman say that
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
their rates were $4 for uh for
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
attachments I can pretty confidently say
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
that speak for Comcast here that we
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
would not challenge a $4 rate um we're
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
paying rates for other attachers that
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
are three four times that um so the the
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
formula again just
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
very specific to each individual poll
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
costs thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so I'm going back
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
to a previous comment that was made
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning to ask you the
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
question um would this amendment in this
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill in your opinion uh would it result
 
00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:27.829 align:start position:0%
bill in your opinion uh would it result
in

00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
less private
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh than what there had been
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
because there's only been two disputes
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh in other words would it create more
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
would would you have less private
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
contracts resolved and there for default
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
to this formula or do you or would you
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
see no change whatsoever as a result of
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh thank you for the
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
question yes so
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
um most the the vast majority of pole
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
attachment contracts in this state are
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
already in existence and have been for
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
for decades um so we're talking about a
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
very few new attachment agreements that
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
are are negotiated today um so we're
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
really just talking about the rate
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
itself um and and the formula for for
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
that rate um and because so when when
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
Comcast receives a a increased poll
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
attachment rate we just get an email and
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
it says here's here's the new rate
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's no negotiation there
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's this is it this is your rate take
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
it take it or leave it basically um
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
because the the polls are as you know a
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
monopoly in a in a sense um and we don't
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
have another way to expand our our plant
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
or you know provide existing services so
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
poll owners have the ability to just say
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
this is the new rate you can dispute it
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the Pu if you'd like but otherwise
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
this is it it's not a a negotiation in
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
in the traditional sense by any
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
means do you know how often those rates
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
change uh it depends on the the poll
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
owners certainly but um recent couple
 
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
years it's they've been increasing
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
almost annually more or less so we get
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
we get 60 days notice of an increase
 
00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:21.230 align:start position:0%
we get 60 days notice of an increase
representative

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
you again for taking my question up in
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
the Pu ruling that uh representative Ms
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
referred to it seemed like they were
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
coming down on both sides you know they
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a clear view is that
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
some for one side and some for the other
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
side it wasn't a very clear decision
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
which suggests to me that they were
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
lacking some of the same information
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
that we we might be lacking uh and that
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
might be because of their power to
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
compel uh the the uh the the parties to
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
provide the information does it seems
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
like that might be one of the issues so
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh my question is if in this FCC formula
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
the would do do the parties have to
 
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
provide the information to the FCC or or
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
to or is the Pu running that proceeding
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
and would they have the power to get the
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
information to to make that decision
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
based on the form on the FCC
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
formula sure thanks for the question yes
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh as as written the the bill would give
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
the Pu that authority to require that
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
information those inputs that I spoke
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
about earlier um into the formula so um
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
the answer is is yes and I would just
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
add to some ear comments about why did
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
why did it take so long to to get to
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
that dispute um and the answer to that
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
is there are few answers but one is
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
because as attachers we did not have
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
access to that information we we still
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
don't largely in many cases um but there
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
was a a separate docket at the Pu
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
related to the the poll transfer um from
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
Consolidated to eversource and in that
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
docket the Pu asked for some of this
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
relevant information and so then when we
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
finally were able to see that we said
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
well based on these costs we're paying
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
way too much um on these rates and so
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we we just didn't know how
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
much we felt we were overpaying until we
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
information okay I want to thanks the
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
two of you for um coming up and and
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to us and answering our
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Thomas thank
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I'm just again looking
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
at my notes and the lawyer from Granite
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
State Communications and I don't have
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
the name of that person um mentioned two
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
items in particular that the formula
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
could become standard and not the
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
fallback uh which was a concern and that
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
it could hinder and hamper
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
negotiations I'm just just from my notes
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
just putting that out there okay thank
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Ms so uh back back to
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
the four four options um um you know I
 
00:55:58.829 --> 00:55:58.839 align:start position:0%
know I had suggested interm study but if
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to do interim study um we're
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
going to need input um and you know with
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
all due respect to the members of this
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee I don't think we have the
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
expertise to evaluate you know the the
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
rates um we would need some input from
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
the doe or the
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
Pu um and that was certainly what I was
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
envisioning if we went if we did interim
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
study is getting somebody to give us
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
some information
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
if as we heard it's going to take you
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
know 9 months to even identify a
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
resource then um it doesn't seem to make
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
sense that we would do interim study uh
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe we can do we can craft
 
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:41.710 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe we can do we can craft
something

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
that said if we think that this is an
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
important enough issue craft something
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
that gives the doe the resources that
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
they need to produce a study that gets
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the legislature by June next
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
year or something
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah you know
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
that an interim study without any kind
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
of resource to give us information is
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
really not going to be
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
meaningful if I may respond to that um
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
and actually I'll ask I'll ask Sean to
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
to respond to that because I think that
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
the doe would undertake much of that
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
analysis in uh the r making process
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
Sean yeah I I think as written the the
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
the bill largely contemplates the doe
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
doing some of that analysis it's it the
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
bill says that doe shall give difference
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the FCC formula and kind of look to
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
it first but all of the the cost data
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
that that we're talking about in and the
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
the information we really haven't seen
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
yet the doe should be able to get that
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
in this proceeding that's contemplated
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill Mr chair could I respond to
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
that yes go ahead
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
month thank you for clarifying that the
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
the concern that I guess I would have is
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh passing this
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill um and then having that analysis
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
done um because I think the ESS I mean I
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
I think that the concern that I have
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
with with the bill is that it would it
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
essentially would
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
replace you know the the the um the
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
procedures that are in place with the
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
Pu currently and so what I'm suggesting
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
is before we make that decision that
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to do it would be
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to understand what the impact
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
difference are there additional
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
folks representative Harrington I
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for somebody
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
else and oh somebody else okay no I
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
think he's thank you very much for for
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
coming forward we appreciate it I've
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
actually had a request from my vice
 
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.750 align:start position:0%
actually had a request from my vice
chair

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
to hear from the a representative of the
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
rural carriers there's some questions
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
that we want to ask of the rural qu
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
carriers so if we could have
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
someone is
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
company Teresa Rosenberger representing
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
the the Hampshire telephone Association
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
I work for brn Shure this is Paul
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
Phillips he's the attorney that
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
represents the the telephone Association
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
any any legal M matters he's with
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
Premier Piper so we're not okay Vice
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas has questions for you happy
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
to answer question thank you thank you
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
it appears that this amendment um one of
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
the cruxes of the of the amendment is in
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
section five regarding the 10% decrease
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
over a certain year period seems to be
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
directed to try and help out the small
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
rural carriers so I would like to get
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
your your sense of opinion on if this
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
section if you feel this section
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
mitigates your your concerns or not I'll
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
speak first then I'll let Paul I'd first
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
say this doesn't cover all of the nhta
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
members it only covers a couple because
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
we do have members who have more than
 
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
we do have members who have more than
1500

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
1500
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
polls I mean 15 excuse me 15,000 polls
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
um and my other comment would be
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
secondly it's still puts the original
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
bill in place which we have lots of
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
problems with lots of questions about uh
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
but it just spreads it out and the way I
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
read it it's retroactive which is even
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
to me more of an issue for um the small
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
carriers because as you see it's January
 
01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
carriers because as you see it's January
1

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
1
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
2024 are the rates but it takes effect
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
on the effective date of the bill and as
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
I see effective date is July 1
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
24 so it seems to me it's retroactive
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't cover everybody but
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
Paul yeah thanks Teresa um so we've
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
heard from our clients and they're not
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
in favor of the amendment um they
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh recognition they
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh opportunity or the
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to um um mitigate the the size
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
disparity if you will between the some
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
of the players you've heard from and the
 
01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:21.799 align:start position:0%
carriers that we represent which are
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
smaller carriers um what you've heard
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
today are some
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
um hints of what's really going on but
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
the not the full story and you know what
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
what you've heard is that there was a
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
litigation at the Pu
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
involving um Comcast and the other cable
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
carriers versus Consolidated and that
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
came out in a way that was sort of a
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
mixed decision uh and the impact of the
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
decision on on the cable carriers is why
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
this legislation is here today um you
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
also heard from Comcast just now that
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
there was another proceeding involving
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh consolid ated and eversource
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
involving the sale of the Consolidated
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
polls and what's interesting there is
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
that Consolidated has effectively
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
divested itself of most of its polls uh
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
and so the impact of this legislation
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
will fall much less harshly on
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
Consolidated because they're no longer
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
you know a large pole owner uh but it
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
will fall on the smaller carriers who
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
still are pole owners but they weren't
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
involved in either either one of those
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
sets of litigation so they're
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
essentially cleaning up the mess here
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
from uh the large players having
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
litigated their disputes and come to
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
some resolution and so so if I could
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
just interrupt you for a second um
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
rather than have you restate the
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
testimony you gave us earlier maybe we
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
could just um answer questions sure in
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
the interest of time because we do have
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
another bill that we would like to
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
discuss before the end of the work
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
session and then we're going to have to
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
go into exec session pretty soon after
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
that so understood thank you questions
 
01:02:57.559 --> 01:02:59.029 align:start position:0%
that so understood thank you questions
representative

01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
Harrington um regarding that section
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
five I'm reading this with the it it
 
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
makes an assumption and the assumption
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
is that the rates being charged now are
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
going to be higher than the rates that
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
would come out of this formula by the
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
thing that says you can you can reduce
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
the rate by 10% a year until it matches
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
that rate so is it safe to assume then
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
that whatever is being charged now is
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
more than would be the charge if you put
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
put use the formula according to the
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
bill and one and two how is the pole
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
owner going to make up for that loss
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue right we read the amendment the
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
same way representative Harrington and
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh one response we got back from our
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
clients was that they don't know what
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
rate the formula will produce um we've
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
heard that it's going to be you know
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
like the FCC formula or closer to the
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
FCC formula but one thing we know from
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is that it's not the FCC
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
formula and so um the amendment presumes
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
that whatever the formula rate is will
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
be lower than what the contract rate is
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have any enough information
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
to know that for sure if in fact though
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
the rates are lower under the
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
formula those costs would come out of
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
the pole owners uh wallet if you will
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
and then have to make up those costs
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead uh um okay so you're
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
saying that the contracts that are in
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
effect now are you reading this bill to
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
say that they would become null in void
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
and new cont new rates would have to be
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
negotiated using the formula for for
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
poll attachments that have already been
 
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
made and in place or would this be just
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
attachments I would say you've just
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
identified one of the issues we have
 
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
with the bill there's no Clarity in it
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
and so we don't really know um I also
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
would say when you talk about you're
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
right that when you read this amendment
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
it assumes the rates are going down I
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't know whether ever source is here
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
but I know when I ran fearo our rates
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
were a lot lower than eversource and as
 
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
I understand it eversource rates are
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat built on the
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
FCC um I do know from that settlement or
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
the the F excuse me the Pu case with
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
with the cables and
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
Consolidated they were looking to cut
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
the rates in half for Consolidated now
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
back to the basic issue here just I
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
think is the heart of what you're
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
talking about what does that mean that
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
means less money for in that case
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
Consolidated for deployment and as you
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
know when they got money from the feds
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
they put in $25 million of their own to
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
match it might actually I might be wrong
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
it might be higher than that but to
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
match the 40 million of the feds I mean
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
with Federal the arpa money so that
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
means less money for them as far as as
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
deployment um it also means the costs
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
are higher what does this mean to uh
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
replacement of polls and maintenance of
 
01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
poles I don't know frankly how Mr ran at
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
Grant State maintains his polls because
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
I think Comcast was absolutely right
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to challenge him he's
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
at $4 doll and which is why they've
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
totally totally overbuilt his district
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
his territory and they seem to have had
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
no problem with getting owned the polls
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
and attaching to the poll so but this is
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
clearly targeted those who are um above
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
that I don't know why Mr ran hadn't
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
raised his rates to tell you the truth
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
but I think you see the gist of it with
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
what Comcast
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
testified they won't build un left they
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
enough subscribers that means they're
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
taking from those who have subscribers
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
now how do they get there they get there
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
by lowering their cost and raising the
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
cost of the competition so um and they
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
you heard them say they don't want to
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
pay for the maintenance so it means the
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
competitor who's the poll owner like
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
Grant State who does offer Broadband
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
they've got to pay for the maintenance
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
as well so there's just so many issues
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
in this that I think as a state we need
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
to know because every time I've been
 
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
here when I was at cons fearo or
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
representing nhta or Consolidated you
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
guys have asked about poll replacement
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
and it's an issue it was an issue when
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
when FairPoint bought the Verizon
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
properties I can't remember you remember
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh revertive Harrington I mean we had to
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
agree to do all these get rid of all
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
these polls so what's that doing to that
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
issue I don't know and um so I hope I
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
answered your question all right
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative muns is going to ask the
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
final question of this work session
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
because we have to talk a little bit
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
about hb45 1 thank you Mr chair m m Mr
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
Phillips I I don't know if I heard
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
correctly but did you say that the
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
formula that would come out of this bill
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
or that would result as a that would be
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
a result of this bill would not be the
 
01:08:10.839 --> 01:08:12.430 align:start position:0%
a result of this bill would not be the
FCC

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
FCC
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
formula I did say that representative
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
mons and the reason I say that is
 
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
because the bill does not require the
 
01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
adoption of the SE of the FCC formula
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
requires a non- adjudicative process for
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
the doe to develop a form formula that
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
will give difference to the FCC formula
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
but will then introduce additional
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
factors that are list listed in the bill
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
that are different from the factors that
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
the Pu now uses and so we don't know
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
what the formula will be at the end of
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
the day uh and you know you're asking us
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
to estimate costs and revenues and all
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
that and I'm I guess what I would
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest is that we you're
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
asking us to predict into a void and we
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what the outcome of that
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
process will
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
be okay with that we're going to end our
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
work session on Senate Bill 595 and very
 
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
work session on Senate Bill 595 and very
briefly

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
discuss Senate Bill
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
451 now representative Corman has uh
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
prepared an
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that is slightly different
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
from the one that I sent to members of
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
the committee last Friday which is an
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh I had prepared in
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the the doe and uh some
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
other folks and so representative Corman
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
is going to pass out that Amendment and
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
it's already passed out
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
oh oh yes so it is amendment 16
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
67h and it is uh should be before you so
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman could you tell
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
us what your Amendment changes from the
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that I submitted and then I'll
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the amendment
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
that I submitted be happy to thank you
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh this is me being pedantic
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh some of you may recall that that at
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
least a couple of times I requested that
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
there be something at the beginning of
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
section uh of RSA 162 H section 7A that
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that section 7A applies
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
only to repurposing qualified existing
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
energy facilities there's the header on
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
line five of page to that says
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
application for certificate qualified
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
existing energy facilities repurposing
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
but I really want there to be language
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
it says this section applies only in
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
those cases so that's what I added and
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
then I also made sure that it was as
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
defined in the appropriate place in the
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
RSA on page one that's the only change
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
other than that it is identical to the
 
01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.189 align:start position:0%
other than that it is identical to the
previous

01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay everybody got that y
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions about
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
it representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
chair um on page two uh section
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
J uh you you dropped or2 system
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
reliability in New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
dropped

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
it so in the amendment that I have I
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
think you're referring to section J that
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
would have been on page three starting
 
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.950 align:start position:0%
would have been on page three starting
at

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
line 13 is that
 
01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
line 13 is that
correct

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh on your Amendment it is um a
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
page two lines one uh lines three and
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
four and the end the end of line four is
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
missing in the new Amendment on page two
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
lines one and
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
two I'm just wondering why it was
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
all I don't recall why we dropped that
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
but that was a recommendation from St
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the department of
 
01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.310 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the department of
energy

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
so Mr shulock do you recall why that
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
did you come forward I can't quite hear
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
you so the language about uh addressing
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
about system reliability was actually
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
Department language we put that language
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill uh so we didn't request that
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
it be removed we just didn't object if
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so I H I had have no memory of
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
shulock thank you you may recall from
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
the um the work session we had on this
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
previously there was some confusion in
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
that section because it said had
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
originally said the applicant would have
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going for memory here would have to
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrate issues around health and
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
safety or system reliability so there
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
was a whole discussion about did that
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
say you didn't have to do one or the
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
other and so because and you may recall
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
from conversations after that the sense
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
was that because uh the site valuation
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee law is primarily a land use um
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
um provision and doesn't necessarily get
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
in into the electrical liability and
 
01:13:59.470 --> 01:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
things that's captured in other sections
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
of state law it was it was best to leave
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
the health and safety as a
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
requirement uh and not allow the
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
applicant to dis not respond to that by
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
simply saying we're more
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
reliable representative Thomas thank you
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
um is it correct to say the health and
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
safety of the state or is it the health
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
and safety of the residents of the state
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
well in other parts of the site
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee law it makes
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
reference to the health and safety of
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
the state so we replicated it in this
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
language thank
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
you okay that clears that up thank you
 
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.470 align:start position:0%
you okay that clears that up thank you
appreciate

01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
that all right so the other big uh
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
change that this amendment makes is
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
basically in section on page one section
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
xi- A starting on line five and going
 
01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
xi- A starting on line five and going
through

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
line two on page two which is that
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
section J that uh we were just talking
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
of the components of the definition of
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
qualified repurposing so that
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
is basically the major change that was
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
made to this amendment there was some
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
language changes that were
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
made that representative Ms suggested
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
and he'll remember exactly where they
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
are so I'm going to ask representative
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
muns to uh refresh our memory about
 
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.669 align:start position:0%
muns to uh refresh our memory about
those

01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
changes I was I was afraid you were
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
gonna ask me that
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's it starts on
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
of oh yeah yep it's at the bottom of
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
page four line 30 starts in line
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
30 uh three yeah 34 or actually 36 and
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
what it does is it says that if
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
the there's a requirement that there be
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
at least one public information session
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
in each County where the proposed
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
facility is located the language that
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
was added says provided that if the
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
proposed facility is located within a
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
single city or town the public meeting
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
will be held within that city or town um
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
and then that same language is also
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
added on um in on page
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay and then the um final change that
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes is on page seven
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
lines 12 and 13 times for conducting
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
public hearings and rendering a decision
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
on the application may be extended for
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
good cause upon written request of the
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
applicant and so those are the changes
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the amendment and
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
um I did entertain any further comments
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
on the amendment representative Thomas
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just looking at my
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
notes there was some uh concern on the
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
old Amendment page three lines 33 and 34
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
with the 180 days that there was a
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with the air permits that um
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
from Dees and I I I noted that that was
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
a conflict but I have no idea if it was
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
resolved if we asked Dees if it was an
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
issue or not
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Harrington brought
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
that um to our attention and I think
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
during our discussion we
 
01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
during our discussion we
determined

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
that it would conform because we we just
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
passed Senate Bill 449 last week it'll
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
be a come up before the house on
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
Thursday which sets the time at 120 days
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
so if the department completes their
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
applications with 120 days then that
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
would meet the requirements of this
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendment of 180
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
days right but does the 180 days
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
supersede the 120 days can they are they
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to push it out to 180 just
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
because it says it here and not in the
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
other bill
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that would be within the
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
purview of the SEC to
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
determine but
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know for sure it's just a
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
concern that that I noted and I I just
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to have resolution to it whether
 
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
all so Mr shulock and Mr Beamer are
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
conferring um maybe we'll have a an
 
01:19:21.639 --> 01:19:22.550 align:start position:0%
conferring um maybe we'll have a an
answer

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
shortly representative Harrington yeah I
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
I think what we did was the original air
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
permit Bill had 180 days and that was
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
switched to 120 so it's two processes
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
here one is for non SEC state agencies
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh Dees Department of Transportation
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
they have 120 days to get whatever
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
permits they need issued then the uh SEC
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
has an additional 60 days for a total of
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
180 days after the application's been
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
accepted to issue a deny the their
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
certificate so it's two different steps
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
involved and the 120 now matches what's
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the other bill that was changed from
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
180 to 120 do we need to spell out that
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
60 days or is that implied in the 180 I
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
I think it's implied by just looking at
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
120 and then you go to the0 okay all
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you I would I would concur
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
that that it is implied
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
there all right I don't see any further
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh questions or comments about this we
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
can discuss it a little bit more during
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
the ex session so let's call to a close
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
451 it is about uh 10:20 so I'm going to
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
call a brief
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
caucus and ask everybody who is not a
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus to leave the room we
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
will return at 10:30 to begin our exec
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
session and at that that time I will
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
introduce uh some guests that we have uh
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in today for members of the
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
committee and Democratic caucus can we
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
just go into the office here because we
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of time to go up and
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
break we learned of
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
a previously
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
unseen problem with the amendment to
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
OS contained a sentence that
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
OS apparently didn't see and forgot to
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
add to the
 
01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.830 align:start position:0%
add to the

01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
file that contains the amendment text
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%

yes uh I'll read it to you and then talk
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%

yeah okay uh it would be I'm working
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
from the version that was was sent to
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
Oso on representative
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
amendment chrisy is in aside did you get
 
01:39:08.119 --> 01:39:10.189 align:start position:0%
amendment chrisy is in aside did you get
the

01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:13.629 --> 01:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
email thank you it would yeah so it
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
would at the bottom of page
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
three currently it is Roman
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
13 uh um there should have been a
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
section following that um which re would
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
read the time to render decision on the
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
application may be extended by the ageny
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
of jurisdiction for good cause upon the
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
written request to the applicant such
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
extension shall be reported to the
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
committee so this was to deal with the
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
situation where if Army Corps of
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
Engineers or Dees or others had uh
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
something that came up where they were
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
not able to meet the deadlines that uh
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
they could you could essentially stop
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
the clock uh and as the committee knows
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
this language went back and forth so we
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
had something that all agencies of
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction which would be you know any
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
permitting agency in the site valuation
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
committee would have that
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
Authority so is that not covered by the
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
text on page seven lines 12 and 13 that
 
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
says times for conducting public
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and rendering a decision on the
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
application may be extended for good
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
cause upon written request of the
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
applicant that section only applies to
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee what I
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
just read to you applies to other
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
agencies of
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction oh okay that's why the
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
clarification language orig was
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
originally proposed yes okay so Christie
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
could you go get a new Amendment based
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
on the Corman Amendment
 
01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.709 align:start position:0%
on the Corman Amendment
16

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
16
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
67h that adds that new
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
section the highlighted section yes yes
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a new a new Roman numeral I
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
believe there' be a EXC me well
 
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative months and that would be
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
a new section so it'll be Roman numeral
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
for uh 14 right yes I believe so Roman
 
01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.350 align:start position:0%
for uh 14 right yes I believe so Roman
numeral

01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
14 so if uh you can work on that
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
Christie we would appreciate that and
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will have a new
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment before we get uh to far down
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
the road here and then we can exact open
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
451 while we wait for
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
that let's open an exec session on
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:48.790 align:start position:0%
 
attachments

01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to make a motion
 
01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
right at the moment because I want to
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
options when we broke for a caucus a few
 
01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.589 align:start position:0%
options when we broke for a caucus a few
minutes

01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
ago our caucus discussed the possibility
 
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
of the the four possibility the four
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
options and we settled on the
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
one requiring the doe to launch an
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
investigation into the this process
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
because there are so many unanswered
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
questions so that would be
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that we would likely
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
like to see go forward so I would like
 
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
to hear what other folks might have to
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
say representative
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
McGee yes Mr chairman it's uh I guess
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
great minds think alike because our our
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh deliberations returned a similar uh
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
discussion and a similar result that we
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
would prefer to have additional
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
information but we didn't think interim
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
study was the right approach and so uh
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
since doe is charged with going down
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
this road if we pass the bill as it is
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
we think it should be handed off to them
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we would prefer to have an amendment
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
on the bill that does that so that we
 
01:43:11.709 --> 01:43:11.719 align:start position:0%
can get some more information before we
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
put it into statutory
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
language representative Corman thank you
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm I'm not in complete
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
agreement with my caucus and and my
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning is that when I read the bill
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
the bill says that the doe is going to
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
develop a formula and then what we're
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
talking about is having the doe
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
investigate which leads to a formula so
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
why not just have the bill as is and
 
01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
have the doe come up with a
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
formula it's a good question but I think
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
the answer to it is
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
that the formula isn't the only thing
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to be investigated there are
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions and
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
we uh discussed some of those questions
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
earlier in our fairly extensive work
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
session on this on this
 
01:44:02.199 --> 01:44:04.030 align:start position:0%
session on this on this
bill

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
um you know does s SP 595 preempt
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
federal law will the Pu apply the new
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
formula is it an an unconstitutional
 
01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.229 align:start position:0%
formula is it an an unconstitutional
government

01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:44:14.239 --> 01:44:16.310 align:start position:0%
government
taking

01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
um what is the transparency of the new
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
process will it be non adjudicatory or
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
judicatory there's all kinds of
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
questions here so I think a doe
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
investigation can maybe address some of
 
01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
those some of them will be policy
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions and they won't touch those but
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
they will investigate more uh fact-based
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of questions so I think a do doe
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
investigation could be useful it is
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a timec consuming process as
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
Mr shulock told us during our work
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
session the application process for uh
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
hiring a consultant is six months by
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
itself and then once you get the
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
consultant hired then you have to start
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
the whole process get the stakeholders
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
involved you're you're looking at a
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
minimum of a year to get this
 
01:45:06.679 --> 01:45:08.470 align:start position:0%
minimum of a year to get this
investigation

01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
done which is unfortunate
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
but I think it's the best way to go
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
about it I just don't see a better way
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
to do it at this point representative Ms
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I I I agree with
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
you I mean um you know if we're going to
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
consider making a change um we need to
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
understand what we're what what all the
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
issues are before we actually change the
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
language and statute um so I I agree
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
with you and I and I think it is
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
something that's worth looking at since
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
as is has been noted um we are the one
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
state in New England that um you know
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a more formulaic approach
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
and um there may be very good reason for
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
that um but it's certainly worth taking
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
a look at before we make any concrete
 
01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
a look at before we make any concrete
steps

01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
forward further discussion Vice chair
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair so um
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
launching an investigation seems like um
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
one way to get more information I'm
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
assuming doe has resources available
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
within their own Department to do such
 
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.589 align:start position:0%
within their own Department to do such
an

01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
investigation is would one of the
 
01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:23.950 align:start position:0%
investigation is would one of the
options

01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
noted in this new Amendment on
 
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
requesting to do an investigation would
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
one of the options be to do nothing at
 
01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:33.639 align:start position:0%
all that there's that there may be no
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
problem and therefore they decide that
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
work good question I suppose that could
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
be an option is an optional outcome of
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
the DOA
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
investigation mechanically if we decide
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
to go this route what we're going to
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
have to do today is we're going to have
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
to recess this executive
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
session and representative McGee and I
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
will have to get together and come up
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that creates this doe
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
investigation lists the questions that
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
we think the investigation should
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
ask and then we will have to come back
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
here probably a week from today or a
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
week from tomorrow and resume the
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
and deliberate over this new Amendment
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that would be the mechanics of the
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
process if we decide to go forward with
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
this with this process chair
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah I'd just like
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
to say if if we're going to come up with
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
a list um I think it will start with the
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
questions but I would I would like to
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
provide um the outcomes that we're
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
seeking from them right if we want the
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
process to be transparent if we want it
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
to be Equitable if we want want to
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
minimize the impacts and the cost
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
shifting that kind of thing I think we
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
should maybe Define the outcomes so that
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
um they would have a clear Mandate of
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
what they needed to solve for and um
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully that would help them tailor it
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
rather than being all over the
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
place absolutely representative Thomas
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
um with this new approach and an
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
amendment how would that alter the
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and do we have enough time
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
to get a new assessment of new fiscal
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
assessment well I guess one of the
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
things that representative McGee and I
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
will have to discuss is whether or not
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
the amended text
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
should allow for the hiring of a
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
consultant obviously that imposes some
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
costs and so we need to we'll have to
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
think about that I'm sure everybody
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
would prefer that we do this without
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
incurring additional costs if we could
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
but whether that's possible or not is a
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
is an open question one we'll have to
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
resolve representative Harrington yeah I
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
think the um um representative of the
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
doe said that they don't have uh
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
in-house I mean basically the telephone
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
division from what used to be the Pu is
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
gone so I don't see that they would have
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
to they would this is a new type of
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
thing having them look into telephone
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
polls um so I I would think they'd have
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
to have some uh new money to do it or
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh just to note that we did hear uh
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
conflicting testimony from from some of
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
the parties uh to the effect that the
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
doe does have the resources and does
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
have that information available to them
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
resolve all right I think we
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas and and again I
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking about a a fair a
 
01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
fairly large chunk of money uh to hire
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
somebody for doe assuming they don't
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
have it and and again this is for two
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
cases in the last 12 years I mean is
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
this really coste effective do we
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
cases well I think it we discussed
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
during our work session that the POS
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility there were a few
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
number of cases in the past 12 years
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
because the existing dispute resolution
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:50:23.639 --> 01:50:25.149 align:start position:0%
process is
so

01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
ineffective that people just weren't
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
bringing forward disputes because they
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
knew that they were not going to be
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily resolved but is that
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
hearsay I mean do we have proof of this
 
01:50:38.589 --> 01:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
I mean i' I've I've heard people say
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
this but do we have actual proof that
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
this has
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
happened well if you think about it the
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee testimony process is all
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
hearsay so um yes it is hearsay but do
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
we do do we have to believe it or can we
 
01:50:55.079 --> 01:50:55.950 align:start position:0%
we do do we have to believe it or can we
believe

01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
right all right I think we have a path
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
forward then on cill 595 so I'm going to
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
recess this executive
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
session and we'll reschedule its
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
resumption at a date
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
certain in the not too distant
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
future by the way I was negligent a
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
moment ago
 
01:51:26.109 --> 01:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
in not
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%

being here sorry you're not going to be
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
able to get your teeth into much but as
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
soon as we get an amendment back from OS
 
01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
on house bill Senate Bill 451 we will
 
01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
have an exec on that
 
01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
bill in the meantime um let's discuss
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
one other thing that
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
personally and I think representative
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
McGee would agree with me is an
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
extremely important stn discussion and
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
that is our end of session
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
lunch so it is
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
a a custom a tradition that at the end
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the session st&amp; all members of St go
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
out to lunch together and so we need to
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
identify a date for our end of session
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
lunch now we could do it next Monday or
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
Tuesday when we have our final exec
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
session it's a logical choice or we
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
could wait till June and do it someday
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
one day in June uh as we get closer to
 
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
the actual end of the
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
session so I'd like to hear a discussion
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
from uh folks here about what they'd
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
like to see for our end of lunch or end
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
of session lunch
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
um representative McGee yeah Mr chair I
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
was just looking at my calendar and um I
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
know on Monday the 6th is's a braver
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
Angels Workshop which is bipartisan
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
effort that folks go to and that's from
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
10 to 2 so um that would maybe represent
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
a conflict for some people who would be
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
attending that so I just wanted to
 
01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
mention that um and so if we're going to
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
do it sooner than later I would
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
recommend that we try and work in uh
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps the
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
and not the 6th but I have no objection
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
to waiting until closer to the end date
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
in early
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
June other ideas and preferences
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ms um I am going to be
 
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
out of pocket um next next uh Monday
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and Wednesday uh but other than
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm fine with anything as long
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
paying that is not part of the tradition
 
01:54:50.199 --> 01:54:55.750 align:start position:0%
paying that is not part of the tradition
I

01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
but I'll consider
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.159 --> 01:55:05.950 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
parial I would thus suggest sooner as
 
01:55:12.589 --> 01:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
later our calendars as we get toward
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.239 --> 01:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
quickly

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe next week maybe the week
 
01:55:21.239 --> 01:55:24.350 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe next week maybe the week
after

01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas uh yes
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
just uh I'll I'll be the one organizing
 
01:55:32.189 --> 01:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
this like I have before in the past so
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
you any comments uh you can get back to
 
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
me on and um we can discuss that plus I
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
for it's not except for maybe one or two
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
people I don't see people who have been
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
here before when we went I think uh cat
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
you were one yeah uh we we went to a
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
place called angelinas which is not far
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
from here at all it was a very good
 
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
Italian place but I'm open to other
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions a place that can sit
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 of us and we always
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
invite our office manager and our
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
researcher as well and so um any place
 
01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
like that that would be conducive to a
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
group like us and who also would be
 
01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
admissible to separate
 
01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:19.719 align:start position:0%
chicks yes I was remiss and forgetting
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
to remind uh or forgetting to request
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
a venue a location from suggestions from
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
you as well representative Ms Common
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
Man the common man oh down the street
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
Common Man okay that's a good suggestion
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I was going to say isn't it
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
also tradition that we treat the staff
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
they don't pay yes we do we do treat the
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
staff so be prepared to throw in a few
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
venue okay we'll leave that up to chair
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas he always does a great
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
job on that kind of thing
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
so all right nothing further to discuss
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
here so I'm going to call a break and
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
ask everybody to stay sort of local so
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
that as soon as the new Amendment for
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 451 comes back we can start
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
and finish our exact session until then
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.119 --> 01:58:21.109 align:start position:0%

1676 H discuss question on the amendment
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned a few moments ago the
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
amendment adds that new text on page
 
02:47:59.710 --> 02:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
four lines one two and three other than
 
02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
that is it is identical to the previous
 
02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment which we discussed
 
02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
earlier does anybody have any comments
 
02:48:10.349 --> 02:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah yeah as I
 
02:48:12.150 --> 02:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
brought up last week I still think this
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
thing has got six too many words in it
 
02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
it says the time to render the decision
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
on the application may be extended by
 
02:48:20.510 --> 02:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
the agency of jurisdiction for good
 
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
cause should end right there it says
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
upon written request of the applicant so
 
02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
if I'm an an agency and I say I can't
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
get your permit done on time so you must
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
send in a written request giving me more
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
time I mean that seems kind of stupid
 
02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
why do we even bother with the upon
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
written request of the applicant I'm not
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
going to hold up the bill on that but I
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
think I'll be back if I'm back next year
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
to get rid of that because it makes
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely no sense telling the
 
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
applicant he must give the the state
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
agency more time well what's his option
 
02:48:52.389 --> 02:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
if he says I'm not going to do that then
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
the agency say well then we don't issue
 
02:48:56.990 --> 02:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
the permit so I mean it's totally
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
meaningless well doesn't the Pu process
 
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
and the SEC process require written
 
02:49:06.910 --> 02:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
notice of virtually everything that
 
02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
happens during the
 
02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
process to a lot extent yeah but they
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
could simply say that the department
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
that will will jur extend it for good
 
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
cause and submit written uh notice to
 
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
the applicant to let the applicant know
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
that would make more sense than saying
 
02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
the applicant has to request a a delay
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
they don't want just I mean like I say
 
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hold up voting on it
 
02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
but it's something we should clean up it
 
02:49:33.710 --> 02:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
should be for good cause and inform the
 
02:49:36.110 --> 02:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
applicant in writing of the cause and
 
02:49:39.630 --> 02:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
the delay or the new date or whatever so
 
02:49:41.469 --> 02:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
that would make more sense seems pretty
 
02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
proor to
 
02:49:47.349 --> 02:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
comments okay good seeing uh none let's
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role on the
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
