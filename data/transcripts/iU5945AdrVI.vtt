them the right to do that if cars are
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
largely illegally parked that was not
 
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%

that but that wasn't that was only part
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%

individual had to pay to get their car
 
00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 align:start position:0%
from the tow company but in their
 
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle were some of their personal
 
00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 align:start position:0%

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
card was in the car
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
so they went to get the car and they
 
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
said what's 40 dollars to us to let you

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to get the money
 
00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 align:start position:0%
to get the car out
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
well go borrow it from someone
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
really i have to go borrow forty dollars
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
from a friend to get into my car to pay
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
you to get into my car so i can get my
 
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
debit card to go to the bank to get the
 
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
money to pay my car
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
out of hock
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was towed
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
from my apartment complex when my car
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
was parked legally with a sticker on my
 
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.430 align:start position:0%
was parked legally with a sticker on my
car

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
so obviously she was quite upset
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
she presented a bill which i have in
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
front of you which i had requested some
 
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the stuff be taken out by
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
legislative services
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
but we all know what happened last year
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
when everything was put together in one
 
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
when everything was put together in one
week

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would never put a bill forth that
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
would have a price tag on something
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
because then what happens is we all know
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislature if you put a price
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
tag on something that has to be always
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
amended year after year after year with
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
inflation or what have you
 
00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.270 align:start position:0%
inflation or what have you
regardless

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
then representative excuse me gary
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
abbott from the agc explained to me that
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
a bill had passed last year
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
rules and laws regarding towing both
 
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
mostly for commercial
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i wanted you to hear that story
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
there are bad apples in every industry
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
in the insurance industry
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
where i sit
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
every once in a while we have a
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
situation and that's why the insurance
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner can take our licenses away
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
if we if we don't follow the rules
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
this was a really bad situation
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't have happened it shouldn't
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
happen again i don't think it rises to
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
the level that we need to go after
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
everybody that does follow the rules and
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
is compassionate about what they do and
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
are responsible for how they operate
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
their towing business but it's a bad
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
story that i wanted to do at least here
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take your questions but i
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
respectfully request
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
that you take my bill and
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
put it in the trash can and i tell it at
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
your earliest convenience today would be
 
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.030 align:start position:0%
your earliest convenience today would be
preferable

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay so given that the uh
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
the sponsor would like the bill to die
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
and every card i have in front of me is
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh opposed to the bill
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
i would just uh say that uh
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%

good morning well i'm brittany schue i
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
am here on behalf of the division of
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles bureau of title and
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
anti-theft after that i wasn't quite
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
sure if what i had to say would add to
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.670 align:start position:0%
that at all
um

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.469 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
at our pose as written um it's
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
introducing 265 108-a
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
this uh statue already exists as parade
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles and that's the biggest
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
fault that we found with this
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
we do feel that people should be able to
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
obtain their vehicles without exorbitant
 
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
obtain their vehicles without exorbitant
fees

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
but aside from that mostly 265 108-a
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
already exists in statute
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to take any
 
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.390 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to take any
questions

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh we can't afford this bill
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
to do toes from what
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
that bill was designed for and i
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
understand it's going to be dropped
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
but our personnel cost too much money
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the trucks cost too many much money the
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
insurance cost too much money everything
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
has just gone crazy as everybody well
 
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.110 align:start position:0%
has just gone crazy as everybody well
knows

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
knows
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
at this point so we we really can't
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
afford to do
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
this kind of towing for the price that
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.830 align:start position:0%

there you go hi good morning
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
my name is devin karkos from new
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire towing association i'm a
 
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire towing association i'm a
director

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm from bob's automotive in dover
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to the bill for pricing
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
as ralph mentioned um
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
what most of our drivers are paid on
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
commission based on tows sometimes day
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
and night and it would be unaffordable
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
and unobtainable to get drivers to be
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
able to handle these type of calls for
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
that situation and as ralph mentioned
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
with insurance and other costs
 
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
with insurance and other costs
increasing

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
it would probably limit the amount of
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
companies doing that
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
one side effect would be a lot of
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
property management places not being
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
able to get cars dealt with and having
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
to move cars for like snow and ice
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
removal reasons it it probably would see
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
a big downturn in having toilet
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
companies be willing to take this on
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
and not be able to get parking lots
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
cleared for safety reasons afterwards
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
because we just couldn't handle it for
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
fair enough so thank you thank you
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
and one more card left bob clegg
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh the blue sheets uh you know a bunch
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
of people were all opposed to it
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
and overnight there was two supporters
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
for this bill overnight
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
and the rest were uh three were opposed
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
 
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.230 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
hearing

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
just so you all know
 
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.910 align:start position:0%
just so you all know
unlike

00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
other committees in the senate this
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee does not kill bills the same
 
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
committee does not kill bills the same
day

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
we deserve every bill should have 24
 
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
we deserve every bill should have 24
hours

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.509 align:start position:0%
hours
uh

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes little things come up that
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
makes us you know want to do something
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
else with the bill and use it as a
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle so we we generally like to hold
 
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
vehicle so we we generally like to hold
hold

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
hold
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
hold it so we don't have to have a
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
non-germane hearing if something were to
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for considering house bill
1413.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
1413.
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh i'll tell you this is my uh i don't
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
know what it is third or fourth attempt
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
to try and do something on the in the
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
realm of internet privacy
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
my previous uh
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
iterations didn't come to this committee
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
they went to the judiciary committee
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
because they were framed in terms of
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
privacy in a different way and so that's
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
where they went they've been successful
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
in the house and unsuccessful in the
 
00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.230 align:start position:0%
in the house and unsuccessful in the
senate

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
for various reasons which we don't need
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.509 align:start position:0%
to deal with
so

00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
having excepted from other states laws a
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
couple times i did it again
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
and this is uh basically
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh the maine law that's been on the
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
books now for six or seven years
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
and according to my information has been
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
challenged in federal court and has
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
stood although it hasn't gone beyond the
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
district court level
 
00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.789 align:start position:0%
district court level
so

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
attempts to
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
degree of privacy to you as an internet
 
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.029 align:start position:0%
degree of privacy to you as an internet
user

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
user
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
by going to
 
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
by going to
[Music]

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
the provider of the service that you're
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
so it starts out and if you look at a
 
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.909 align:start position:0%
so it starts out and if you look at a
provider

00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
on line 28
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
the provider means a person who provides
 
00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:19.830 align:start position:0%
the provider means a person who provides
in

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
broadband internet access service
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
which is defined in roman one on line
 
00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:28.549 align:start position:0%
which is defined in roman one on line
six

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
and it's any mass-market retail service
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
by wire or radio that provides the
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
capability to transmit and receive data
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
from pretty much anybody on the internet
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
so it's your phone company it's your
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
cable company if you get internet access
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
through your cable it's uh whoever it is
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you're dealing through satellite
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
whoever's providing you the access
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
that's where this bill is targeted
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones to whom you are
 
00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.029 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones to whom you are
bound

00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
bound
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
i mean and you are really practically
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
their slaves in terms of what you can
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
what you do on the internet every single
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
thing that you do goes through them
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and they have the ability to extract and
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
information from that of sorts that you
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even think they would want or
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
would you have any value
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
but they turn out to be of great value
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
like your location where you just happen
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
to be at that particular time because
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
that can be taken and correlated with
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
other people who are in the same place
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
and we can find out everybody you ever
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
talked to in your entire life
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
when and where and probably what you
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
were talking about through other means
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
of stuff that we can get that you do
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
through the internet
 
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.190 align:start position:0%
through the internet
uh

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
uh
so

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
so the risk
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
to our
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
this is kind of like inherent in our
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
privacy we don't have the right to
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
record other people
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
we expect
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
when you're not in a setting such as
 
00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.549 align:start position:0%
when you're not in a setting such as
this

00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.509 align:start position:0%
this
that

00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
nobody else has the right to
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
know what we're doing
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
but yet
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
this data that's being collected
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
is exactly that
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
they know they can know pretty much
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
everything you're doing
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
when where why with whom and all of that
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
so to try and get corral that somewhat
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
use

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
the information that they can gather
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
for any purposes
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
except for those which you gave it to
 
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:34.470 align:start position:0%
except for those which you gave it to
them

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
right they can't sell it
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
transmit it or even allow access one of
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the great and i think
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
travesties in our systems right now
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
the government
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
can just pick drop a dime and say oh i
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
want to know everybody's cell phone who
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
was in washington dc in the on a certain
 
00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.430 align:start position:0%
was in washington dc in the on a certain
day

00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
or around the governor's house on a
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
certain time in a certain time period
 
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
certain time in a certain time period
right

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
or at your house
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
oh no
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
they know who's at your house but the
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
this bill intends to curtail that
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
at the source
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
where you are entering into the internet
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
that is the provider
 
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
that is the provider
and

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
it includes great
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
exceptions for all the important uses
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
from lines 16 to
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
30 on the second page
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i won't waste your time going
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
through all of those but it's all the
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
ones you would expect and no one's in
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
subject to a warrant or
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
to render and bill for services
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
they can even provide your geolocation
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
in case of emergencies
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
to certain entities but always for your
 
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.710 align:start position:0%
to certain entities but always for your
benefit

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
always and only for your benefit
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
and it includes a penalty section as it
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
which we have how we have elevated to
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office to enforce
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason we did that is because
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
these are big people that we're talking
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
about regulating
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
and you and i would not want to go to
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
court against comcast
 
00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:22.950 align:start position:0%
court against comcast
or

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
any other of these
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
providers there are some some
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill like how they
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
protect your data
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
that does allow flexibility for the size
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
of the provider
 
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.109 align:start position:0%
of the provider
so

00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
down on lines 33-37
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
on page two it talks about implementing
 
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.910 align:start position:0%
on page two it talks about implementing
security

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.270 align:start position:0%
security
measures

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the factors that have to be
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
considered in one of those is the scope
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the provider's activity
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
right so if it's a small provider
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
then they probably don't have to
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
implement the security measures that
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'll just use comcast again might have
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
so with that i uh i guess i'll take a
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
couple questions uh i would like to keep
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
this brief
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
because i'm absent from my committee
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
right now and i'm the clerk so it makes
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
it hard for me when i'm here
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay no problem representative
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note um on this bill
 
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note um on this bill
um

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
i don't understand i mean it really will
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
affect the attorney general's office can
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
you comment on that
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
so i don't uh
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
derive fiscal notes and they don't make
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense to me a lot of times but
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
i will just say that nobody has any idea
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
how many claims might come up or what
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
involvement it might take for the
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
attorney general to solve this and so
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
they probably just said ah there's
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
nobody oh i do have something uh i
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
looked at the online testimony on this
 
00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
looked at the online testimony on this
yesterday

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
and uh richard head testified that
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
because it creates a new cause of action
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
the senate the effective date has to be
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
moved out but you have that testimony
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions of
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
question and i'm asking this i actually
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't totally understand about cookies
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
and how they're used but yeah cookies
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's we're better off eating them just
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
say no
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
i got excited when they asked me if i
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
wanted them i always said yes but
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
my question is and and you may not you
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
may know
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
as much as i do but
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm increasingly seeing that sites are
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
making you accept cookies before you can
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
use them making you accept
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
to say that that they'll use you they
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
can use your data and i don't know if
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
that goes to the internet provider or
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
not when you do that
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
or is it just on the website that you're
 
00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
or is it just on the website that you're
browsing

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
browsing
 
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.230 align:start position:0%
browsing
so

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in this bill
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
that says they cannot deny you service
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
unless they've made clear
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
and explicit
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
what their what information they're
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.230 align:start position:0%
going to
sell

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
which does not include your personal
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
information there's lots of other
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
information that's out there and they
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
have to make clear to you they're going
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
to sell that
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh which would be the same type of thing
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
but that they can't deny you service
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
this denial of service for failure to
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
allow them to put something on your
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
machine that you have no idea what it's
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
really going to do but they say it's
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
only gonna oh we'll know when the last
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
time you came and what you looked at
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't like it
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
one time we i tried to build it said
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do that
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it came to this committee and they
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
they have that
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
myself when they ask for cookies
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
i never say
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes and if they won't let me do anything
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
i go somewhere else there's another
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
internet side i can find what i want
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so you're sticking with
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
of course it could be girl scout
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
cookies some of those s'mores
 
00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:13.589 align:start position:0%
cookies some of those s'mores
okay

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much we'll let you
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
go thank you
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
all right so since he was mentioned
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again richard it's great
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
to see you again mr chairman uh my name
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
is richard head i'm the government
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:36.870 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
branch

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
and as the representative mentioned i
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony i have
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
a fairly simple request which relates to
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the bill if this
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to proceed there's a statute
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
actually that governs effective dates
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
that i referenced in my in my letter of
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
testimony i submitted rsa 14 colon 9a
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
is a specific statute that addresses
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
effective dates
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
and there's a provision in that where if
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
the bill impacts the judicial branch
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
either policies practices or adds or
 
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
either policies practices or adds or
deletes

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
deletes
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
civil or criminal remedies
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
the effective date should be january 1
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
of the following year
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i like speaking to big committees
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
because all of you are also submitting
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislation so it's something to keep in
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
mind anytime you are you are putting
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
legislation forward
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
i do this probably 30 40 times
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
a session
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
so the extent i can reduce that it's
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
helpful um and the reason is is fairly
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
simple from our end
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is one bill of many many
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
bills um and so for example if a
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
criminal provision is changed or there's
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
a new civil provision that's added
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have a database that has a line for
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
every criminal action
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then within criminal actions like
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
for example if it's a drug case
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
the weight sometimes affects the the
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
nature of what the penalty can be so
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
there you know one line in a in a
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
criminal statute can have three or four
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
lines in our database the same is true
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
with civil causes of action and this
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill adds a civil cause of
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
action so from our end we need to be
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to both adjust our systems but also
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
engage in training for our judges our
 
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
engage in training for our judges our
staff

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
and what have you
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
so a long-winded way of asking for if
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is to go forward that the
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
effective date be modified to january 1
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
2023 and with that i'd be happy to
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a question representative
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:58.870 align:start position:0%
following me you should listen to him
carefully

good morning

everybody hear me okay
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairman members of
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is brandon garad
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a senior assistant attorney general
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
chief of the consumer protection and
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
anti-trust bureau at the new hampshire
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony this morning is limited to
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
the last section of this bill which if
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
effective would be
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 359 t9 which is labeled penalties
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
and enforcement
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
so as the sponsor indicated this bill
 
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.150 align:start position:0%
so as the sponsor indicated this bill
anticipates

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
anticipates
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
putting this new statute in the hands of
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office for
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement it does not indicate a
 
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.630 align:start position:0%
enforcement it does not indicate a
specific

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
bureau that would enforce it however
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
given the nature of the legislation
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
i suspect they would likely fall to the
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau as it is
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
essentially a consumer protection issue
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
that it's um addressing
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
so as the potential enforcer of this
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill i think it's incumbent on the
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to point out
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the way the penalties and
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement section of this bill is
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently drafted
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
would render it essentially
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
unenforceable at all by the attorney
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
general's office and i'll explain why
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
for the consumer protection anti-trust
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
bureau our authority to investigate
 
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
bureau our authority to investigate
potential

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
violations of law largely comes from rsa
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
358-a which is the new hampshire
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
which makes it unlawful to engage in
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive acts or practices
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
in the course of commerce and if
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
something is either specifically labeled
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
as an unfair and deceptive act of
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
practice in the course of commerce or
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
fits that general definition the
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general then has the ability to
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
compel live testimony of witnesses to
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
compel documents to conduct an
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
investigation in order to determine
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
whether a violation has actually
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
occurred and if through our
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
investigation we're able to prove that
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
an unfair and deceptive act or practice
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
has occurred we then have significant
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
civil or criminal penalties around the
 
00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:10.950 align:start position:0%
civil or criminal penalties around the
table

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
injunctive relief fines potentially jail
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
time if it's a criminal case
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
but the way this is currently worded
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
nothing about this puts
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
a violation of this statute
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
specifically under new hampshire's
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act it does not make
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
it an unfair and deceptive act or
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
practice in commerce does not
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
specifically say that it will be
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
enforced under the consumer protection
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
act so therefore the ability to issue a
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
subpoena to compel testimony to enter
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
into an investigation assuming we
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
receive a complaint of this we would
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
essentially have no authority to compel
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
anything from the business
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
which is obviously problematic when as
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor noted you're dealing with
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
large corporations such as comcast
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
verizon uh companies that are not
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
exactly going to show up as a willing
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
participant participant to sit down and
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
engage in a voluntary interview with the
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to determine
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
whether they violated new hampshire law
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i suggest that you know
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
the way it's currently written the way i
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
would see it playing out is a consumer
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
could come to the attorney general's
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
office and say
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a violation of the statute
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to enforce it
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
our ability to investigate would
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
essentially be limited to what the
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
consumer was able to provide us
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
and what the business was voluntarily
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
willing to give us and and that's not
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
really an effective way for us to
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
enforce a statute like this i think that
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
if this is to go forward there needs to
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
be serious consideration about
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
how the attorney general's office is
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
going to have the authority to do a
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
meaningful investigation of complaints
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
when they come in because right now the
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
way it's written i i really don't see
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we'd be able to do the level of
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
thorough investigation that we do
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
whenever we receive consumer complaints
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
the the second issue that i'll point out
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
is that this
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
statute in in terms of penalties and
 
00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.390 align:start position:0%
statute in in terms of penalties and
enforcement

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
limits the available tools to the
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office as a thousand
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
dollar fine for a violation
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
under the consumer protection act an
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive act or practice is
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
punishable by a fine of up to ten
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per violation as well
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
as the ability to receive injunctive
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
relief and the ability like i said if
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's criminal case to impose jail time
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
retains that discretion
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
based on the investigation the level of
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
the conduct the the mental state of the
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
bad actor how many complaints we
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
received to have all those tools in our
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
toolbox to enforce the statute and
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
really seek justice to ensure that the
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
bad actor
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
a doesn't act this way again in order to
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
protect consumers and be as punished
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
on a level consistent with the bad
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
action that's taken
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that the ability for
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office to impose
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
a civil penalty that can't exceed a
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars likely would not do
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
much to deter large corporations like
 
00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
much to deter large corporations like
comcast

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
comcast
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
and would really bootstrap the attorney
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
general's office at a very very limited
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement authority to be able to do
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
anything about potential violations of
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
the statute essentially it would allow
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
corporations to simply make this go away
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
by paying a fine and you know a fine
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
that really in the grand scheme of
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
things is significantly less than the
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
fine that the legislature has
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
anticipated as appropriate for
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
violations of the consumer protection
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
act ten thousand dollars per violation
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
and as you know significantly more um if
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's a private right of action brought
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
by a citizen depending on the the mental
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
state of the company
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i i think that the if this goes
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
forward the i would encourage the
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to consider um whether it
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense to keep this as a thousand
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
dollar fine or whether it should be
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
expanded to allow the attorney general's
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
office to use its discretion um
 
00:48:43.359 --> 00:48:44.390 align:start position:0%
office to use its discretion um
in

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
seeking appropriate injunctive relief
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
certainly this wouldn't even give us the
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
ability to get a court order an
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
injunction to prevent the conduct from
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
happening in the future would simply
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
allow us to take a fine
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
and the final issue was pointed out you
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
know this
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
ascribes a new responsibility to the
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office of of the type
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
that we have not previously seen before
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
there was no fiscal note done so if this
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
is passed it raises the question of
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
additional resources
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many complaints we
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know how difficult or
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
time-consuming these investigations
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
so it's an indeterminate fiscal impact
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
at this point but it is likely to
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the number of
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
complaints that come into the bureau and
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
that very well may pose the need for
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
additional resources if this is
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
something that the attorney general's
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
office has asked to enforce
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the synopsis of my
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
testimony if there's any questions happy
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
humor because i i it is true i've never
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
seen this uh pay much attention to the
 
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
seen this uh pay much attention to the
penalty

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh to negotiate and to settle with
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
suspected violators without court action
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
have you ever seen that before in in any
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i i can't i i
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
have not seen it in legislation uh it's
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not present in any of the
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
statutes that the bureau currently
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
enforces forces
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
currently if if we want to impose a fine
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
i would have to be done either through a
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
civil complaint and a consent judgment
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
that that settles
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
that where the fine is agreed upon or
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
file a civil complaint go to trial
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
receive an order from the court
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
requiring the company to impose the fine
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
or it could be agreed upon
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
through what's called an assurance of
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
discontinuance which is a tool that's
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
anticipated under the consumer
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
protection act that allows us to settle
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
with an offending business or individual
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
not really if it's filed with the court
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
so there is some level of court
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
involvement but it doesn't have the same
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
court approvals that are necessary for a
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
civil complaint consent judgment but no
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
language like that
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
is not something that we see in the
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
statutes that we enforce i haven't seen
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
first time i've ever seen it
 
00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.670 align:start position:0%
first time i've ever seen it
okay

00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee see none
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
all right uh chris
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
good morning can you you spell your last
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
name so we make sure we get it right
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
sure yeah it's uh
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity uh to testify
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh my name is chris gilrayne i'm with
 
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
uh my name is chris gilrayne i'm with
technet

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
technet
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
we are an industry
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
organization representing a wide array
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
of companies throughout the innovation
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
ecosystem from internet service
 
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
ecosystem from internet service
providers

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
autonomous vehicles cloud computing
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
clean energy and more
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
the one thing that really unites all of
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
these very disparate industries is an
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
interest and a stake in data privacy
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
our members place a high priority on
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
consumer privacy and for that reason uh
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
we are investing significant time and
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
resources into advancing a federal
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
standard that would with have clear
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities when it
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
comes to consumer protection and data
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
protection for all americans
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not there is no
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
internet of new hampshire or vermont or
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
even california there is a borderless
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
ecosystem and privacy laws should be
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
handled at the federal level in
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
recognition of that
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
fortunately in the case of hp 1413 the
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
specific data and practices that this
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill is seeking to restrict the use of
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
is already well protected under a number
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
of federal standards
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
beginning with the ftc standards the
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
federal trade commission
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
and a patchwork of other federal privacy
 
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.670 align:start position:0%
and a patchwork of other federal privacy
laws

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.870 align:start position:0%
laws
including

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.990 align:start position:0%
including
coppa

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
coppa
 
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:54.950 align:start position:0%
coppa
the

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
controlling assault of non-solicited
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
pornography and marketing act
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
security breach and unfair practices
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
laws as well
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
our concern is that the broad
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions and the use of consumer
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
data could throw into question a wide
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
range of everyday processes that
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
underpin the customer experience here in
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
combined with a private right of action
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
the broadness and vagueness of some of
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
the language here and could cause a
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
significant liability risk for companies
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
particularly at a time when
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
the federal money coming in is uh
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
allowing these companies to focus on
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
expanding their networks expanding the
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and connecting
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
more granite state residents
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
that should be the focus is connecting
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
residents as opposed to uh
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
being concerned about potential massive
 
00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:47.670 align:start position:0%
being concerned about potential massive
liability

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
and that is a significant concern
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
particularly when we pair it with the
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
private right of action we've seen it uh
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
in a number of states
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
privacy laws are complex and open to
 
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.390 align:start position:0%
privacy laws are complex and open to
interpretation

00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
and when it's paired with the private
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
right of action we've seen
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
in illinois under their biometrics law
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
in california under their privacy law
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of settlement-seeking behavior
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
that really benefits nobody but the pr
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs bar
 
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.069 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs bar
uh

00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
to that end i'll i'll wrap up i i know
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people behind me um
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate your time
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
great thank you any questions see none
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh richard yes
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative abel thank you um i just
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure i i understood you
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
correctly did you say that there are
 
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.390 align:start position:0%
correctly did you say that there are
federal

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
laws that already cover this and if so
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
could you just
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit about that
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the main
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
umbrella is the ftc standard um
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to specific uh pieces
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
of data that are called out in the
 
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.910 align:start position:0%
of data that are called out in the
bill

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to the
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
information of miners that falls under
 
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
information of miners that falls under
kappa

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
kappa
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
and geolocation data already covered
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
and so the it's the ftc is the big
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
umbrella but there are other specific
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
laws that cover some of the specific
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
information that's uh that's delineated
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you

interagency task force
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
that developed a framework for consumer

data privacy in the 21st century
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
which has been supported and implemented

industries i want to start by commending
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
the committee for examining a very
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
important issue and very complicated
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
issue of consumer privacy
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
hb 1413 is well-intentioned but it is
 
00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.349 align:start position:0%
hb 1413 is well-intentioned but it is
problematic

00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
in a number of ways
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
in large part because
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
it diverges from the well-settled
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
approach taken by
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
the federal trade commission on a
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis and virtually every
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
other existing privacy regime
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
the ftc framework was designed to
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
protect consumers and preserve companies
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
ability to innovate and provide their
 
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.829 align:start position:0%
ability to innovate and provide their
services

00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
the approach in this bill
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
would undermine both of those goals and
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
would have a number of unintended
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
consequences some of which i'd like to
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
highlight for the committee today
 
00:57:35.359 --> 00:57:36.630 align:start position:0%
highlight for the committee today
first

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
the bill does not cover all commercial
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
entities in the online marketplace that
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
handle personal information it covers
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
only broadband providers
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
which have a strong record of protecting
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
their customers privacy
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
and does not regulate edge providers
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
such as search engines social media
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
networks mobile apps or companies that
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
collect use and disclose large amounts
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
of consumer information like data
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
brokers and online ad networks
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
leaving these other entities free to use
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
consumer internet browsing history
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
real-time geo-location information
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth to target ads and for other
 
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.750 align:start position:0%
and so forth to target ads and for other
purposes

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
it therefore fails to protect consumers
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
in the area where their privacy is most
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
nor does the bill explain how consumers
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
would be protected against mishandling
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
of personal information by third parties
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
that receive personal information
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
that is precisely what happened in the
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
cambridge analytica incident a few years
 
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:40.630 align:start position:0%
cambridge analytica incident a few years
ago

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
that sparked much of the concern about
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
these issues over the last several years
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
yet the bill fails to address that
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
the bill also would impede legitimate
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
business activities
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
it treats all personal information
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of that information's
 
00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.789 align:start position:0%
regardless of that information's
sensitivity

00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
sensitivity
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
requiring companies to obtain express
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
affirmative opt-in consent before using
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
disclosing or making available such
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
information to any person
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of and without exception for
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
the consumer's expectations or the
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
context in which the personal
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
information was collected
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
but not all data if misused or
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
wrongfully disclosed has the same
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
potential to harm consumers
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
a social security number or health
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
related information is not the same as a
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
device's ip address
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
which is why the ftc's privacy framework
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
and virtually all other recently enacted
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
state privacy laws in california
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
colorado and virginia
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
and even the european union's rigorous
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
general data protection regulation
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
apply different levels of consent to
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
sensitive and non-sensitive data
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
in addition broadband providers like
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
other companies typically analyze
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
information regarding the use of their
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
services to improve those services and
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
to develop new products and services
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
they also use such information to
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
protect their networks from bad actors
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the ftc recognized that these activities
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
were consistent with the context in
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
which companies collect information from
 
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.990 align:start position:0%
which companies collect information from
consumers

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
and that consent to engage in those
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
activities could therefore be inferred
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
this bill however would require
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
providers to get opt-in consent from
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
customers before using their information
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
for such purposes
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
this could actually harm consumers by
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
for example depriving them of offers for
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
discounted prices
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
or other ways to reduce their costs and
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
it would impair innovation by depriving
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
businesses of helpful information that
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
they need to design and improve their
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
products and services in a way that
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
appeals to consumers
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
other provisions of the bill are
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
unworkable for companies
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
you will hear later this morning about
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
how pervasive encryption of internet
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
traffic makes consumers online activity
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
largely invisible to isps
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
this is by design and it's an important
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
security protection that has been
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
developed over time
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
yet this bill would make isps
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for obtaining consent before
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
making consumer personal information
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
available to other entities
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
this would be an impossible task without
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
undermining the various security
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
protections that have been put in place
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
to protect consumers
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
the bill also applies to any individuals
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
located in new hampshire
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
but the companies won't always know
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
where consumers are located
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
this will require companies to track the
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
location of individuals to determine
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
whether the law applies again
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
undermining rather than protecting
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
consumers privacy
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
moreover the use of precise geo-location
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
information is prohibited under the bill
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
absent express affirmative consent from
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
the consumer or when it is used for one
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
of several emergency purposes
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
providers would not even know from whom
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
they would need to obtain consent
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
because they would be precluded from
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
using the location of their mobile
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
customers for this purpose
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
in addition the definition of customer
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
personal information is overbroad and
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
appears not to have any limiting
 
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
appears not to have any limiting
principle

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
it can be read to capture any
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
information from a customer's use of the
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
internet access service
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
this potentially includes virtually all
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
information that broadband subscribers
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
generate when they use broadband
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
services including data that doesn't
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
identify and can't be linked to a
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
specific individual
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
the bill also allows consumers to direct
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
providers not to use disclose or make
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
available information that is not
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
customer personal information
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
in combination these provisions would
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
actually preclude providers from
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
offering services to their customers
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
of course i'm not sure i'm sure that's
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the bill but that is
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
how it currently reads
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
in addition the bill prohibits companies
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
from making consent to use and disclose
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
personal information a condition of
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
providing a service
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
but isps need to use and disclose
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
personal information to third parties in
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
order to provide their services
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
for example isps must disclose ip
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
addresses when they deliver emails
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
hb 1413
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
will provide consumers with no
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
protection against the misuse of
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
personal information by social networks
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
and companies like google that as the
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
headlines government enforcement actions
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
record fines and widespread litigation
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
both here and abroad have shown are the
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
biggest drivers of public concern over
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
online privacy
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
the result will be consumer confusion
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
and frustration as consumers learn that
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
the rights afforded to them in this bill
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
offered them no protection against
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
virtually all other businesses operating
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire online including the
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
largest abusers of their personal
 
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
largest abusers of their personal
information

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
finally an identical law currently in
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
effect in maine is the subject of
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
litigation on the grounds that it
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
violates the first amendment of the u s
 
01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:33.589 align:start position:0%
violates the first amendment of the u s
constitution

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
at issue is the very approach that hb
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
1413 takes here namely the regulation
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the use and disclosure of data
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
by one category of speaker isps and isps
 
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.789 align:start position:0%
by one category of speaker isps and isps
alone

01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
discovery and briefing on the merits in
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
that case is underway and a decision is
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
likely to be issued later this year or
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
early next year
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
at the very least we ask that new
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire defer its current process
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill until the main case
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
has been resolved
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
we are testifying today in opposition to
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1413.
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
as drafted
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
the bill's privacy protections targeted
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
are targeted only at internet service
 
01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:49.990 align:start position:0%
are targeted only at internet service
providers

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
as you've heard this is neither legally
 
01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
as you've heard this is neither legally
permissible

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
permissible
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
nor effective
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
if the goal
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
is to protect the privacy of consumers
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
this bill will not achieve that goal
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
most importantly
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
the bill fundamentally misunderstands
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
the role of isps
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
and when and where consumer data
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
is accessible
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
on behalf of necta
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
my goal is not only to share with you
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
our broad concerns
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
about this legislation but to ensure
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
that you have access
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
to the expertise
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
to expertise in this subject matter
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd like to introduce you
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
to brian scriber he is a distinguished
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%

and i am a professional nerd so i
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
the work that we do at cable labs as
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
maura mentioned is very focused on
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
security and privacy of subscribers when
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
they are online
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to talk today about some
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
of the technologies
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
that are in place and how technology has
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
changed in the last 15 years
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
to create a very different environment
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
from the kind of i think mindset that
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
came into play for writing this bill and
 
01:08:55.839 --> 01:08:57.030 align:start position:0%
came into play for writing this bill and
the

01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
the the pieces of when we start talking
 
01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:00.390 align:start position:0%
the the pieces of when we start talking
about

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
the deck that i think now everybody has
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
has the the deck that's come through
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
so the house bill 1413 lists nine
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
categories of information that the bill
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
wants isps to protect uh the handout
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
explains technological capabilities of
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
isps to access each of those categories
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
for many of the listed categories isps
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
can neither see nor protect or do
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
anything with that data and that is by
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
design the security in place the https
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh when you on the browser see that lock
 
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
uh when you on the browser see that lock
icon

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
icon
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
when you are online that is a
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
relationship between you
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
and the end point the isp does the job
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
of moving bits across the the wire
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't see
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
the encrypted data between you and that
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
website and that website that you visit
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
can have information can have scripts
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
that run that advise other websites
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
about who you are and what you did on
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
previous websites that is information
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
that is completely invisible to the
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
service provider that is doing the job
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
of carrying those bits across for you so
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make sure
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
if if there was one thing that i i
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh helped the committee understand today
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
is technology has changed from when
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
this may have have had some some more
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
sense to its applicability today
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
that encryption and the invisibility of
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
your interactions online to the isps
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
make this a step backwards
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and it puts the isps back in a spot
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
where we have to start cracking open
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
things and working to try to figure out
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
how your
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
um your your interactions online could
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
better be protected that actually
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
is like i said i think a step in the
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
wrong direction for how we want to do
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
this so the security and privacy
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
technologies team at cable apps how do
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
we get people more protected how do we
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
get you more encryption
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
and how do we get there
 
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.830 align:start position:0%
and how do we get there
98

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
98
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
of consumer time online
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
is over an encrypted channel
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is a tremendous change from where
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
we were 15 years ago when you were
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
looking at about 30
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
of that traffic being encrypted there
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
has been a massive upswell in the
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
adoption of https of messaging services
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
these are all
 
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.270 align:start position:0%
these are all
protecting

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
the transit layer so the isp that
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
carries that traffic
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
all we see are very random looking bits
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we we have no ability to to dive
 
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
that we we have no ability to to dive
into

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
i want to focus for a second on
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's slide
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
5 shows the
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
networking layers and on this one
 
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
networking layers and on this one
they're

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're without without diving into a
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
full networking course
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are seven networking layers the
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
top three the application presentation
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
and session layer that's where like
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's how you as a user on the internet
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
interact with things you're using an
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
application you're using email you're
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
browsing you're going to a website
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
you're using a messaging service like
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
signal or telegram
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
any of those activities where you're on
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
google where you're on duckduckgo all of
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
that activity happens in
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that layer um
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
and then it's encrypted everything below
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
that that's where cable isps
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
exist so this is where the transport the
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
network the data link and the physical
 
01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:55.669 align:start position:0%
network the data link and the physical
layer

01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
layer
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is what we worry about and how we
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
how we make sure traffic gets delivered
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
and it's it's confidential it's
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
integrity hasn't so nobody's changed the
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
messages you've sent and um that it's
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
that it's always available so
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
confidentiality integrity and
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
availability that's where we focus on
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
those lower layers but the slide before
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
this is slide four and on on that slide
 
01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
this is slide four and on on that slide
um

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
this is where
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh we we dive into the nine categories
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
of information that we want to protect
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
and this is i think an important one to
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
kind of walk through
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
if we take a look at the column for
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
cable isp visibility there are
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
several of these
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
financial information we never see it so
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
we can't protect it we
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
we can't see that info
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
the customer's health information we
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
can't see it we can't advise you that
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
you are releasing your information on a
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
website because we don't know what's
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
happening inside that website
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
the information pertaining to your
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
children not visible the content of your
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
communications what you texted what you
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
sent not visible
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
from a pure technology perspective when
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
we look at the rest of this there's some
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
complicated nuance in some of these and
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
again i i won't dive into
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the hyper details on this but
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
customer web browsing history is
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
important to point out
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
the isp is not your browser right that
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
browser is a piece of software that you
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
install on your computer and that
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
software um in the case of chrome which
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
is uh the the most used browser that's a
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
piece of software that that google has
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
written and and published so google's
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
interaction with you at that layer then
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
becomes encrypted
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't see anything other than
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
potentially a look up to see how to
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
deliver traffic so if you were to go to
 
01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
deliver traffic so if you were to go to
cablelabs.com

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
cablelabs.com
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
and type that into your browser there's
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
a something called a dns lookup where we
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
check to see what is effect it's kind of
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
like a phone book right you look up a
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
name and you get back a number well
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's what dns does it says here's the
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
routing number for cablelabs.com and
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
then your traffic is encrypted and goes
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
over that we don't know what pages
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
inside cablelabs.com you were to visit
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
we don't know
what

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
forms you fill out any of the messaging
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
that happens so our ability to protect
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
as this bill is is written becomes
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
pretty problematic when we're talking
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
about an encrypted exchange so um
 
01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
about an encrypted exchange so um
the

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's the why there's a limited right
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's some level of information about
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
this that the isp has that's actually
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
diminishing as
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
dns itself is becoming encrypted so
 
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.550 align:start position:0%
dns itself is becoming encrypted so
that's

01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult to engage in as
 
01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.750 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult to engage in as
well

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
customer application usage history
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
for network optimization perspectives
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
and um and the ability to do again some
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
of this lookup if you are
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
we may know that you have gone to a site
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
like netflix and that there's a lot of
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
traffic that's coming down and we may
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
need to reconfigure the network to be
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
able to optimize it so that that traffic
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
comes down so that your experience
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
online is as positive as it can be so
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's some information we don't know
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
what you watched on netflix we don't
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
know how you interacted with netflix but
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
we do know that hey you're
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
there there's still a good amount of
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
traffic that we have to deliver to your
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
end point from from that net end point
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
the as far as customers precise
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
geo-location information um from a
 
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
geo-location information um from a
terrestrial

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
terrestrial
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh cable hybrid fiber coax perspective
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
like if you have uh uh comcast or a
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
charter uh deployment there is a cable
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
that runs from the head end all the way
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
out to your house
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
and so with that we do know where we
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
deliver service
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
but we do not know
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
where you are we just know this is where
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
we send the bill and this is where we
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
send the bits so um that's the the limit
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
geo-location information that a
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
terrestrial cable company has um as we
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
go down this list though there's two
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
other places where there's a yes
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
device identifiers
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
devices that connect to the internet
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
we do know some information about those
 
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.110 align:start position:0%
we do know some information about those
devices

01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
in in some cases
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
that is to secure that connection uh and
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
if those devices participate in ddos
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
activities or botnets we may need to
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
advise the the home user hey there is a
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
device that
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
matches this description can you take a
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
look at it update the firmware you know
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
whatever may need to happen if you're
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
participating in a a botnet uh so very
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
sis it's critical to deliver the service
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and so we do have some of that
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
information but that is
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
for the the the purpose of delivering
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
secure and and private service uh as far
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
as the origin and destination internet
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
protocol addresses i want to spend one
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
second on this one because i think it's
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
such an important part of how this bill
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
is written and the protection of an ip
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
address if you'll take a look in the
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
slide deck
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
two slides later there's
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
packets and visibility and on that slide
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see every every internet packet
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
that gets delivered
 
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
that gets delivered
has

01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.870 align:start position:0%
has
a

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
a a header that looks like this part of
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
that header that source address and
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
destination address
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
just like us mail
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a great analogy to use
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about how we deliver
 
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about how we deliver
traffic

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
the us mail has to have the address you
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
expect this thing to get to
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
and your return address hey if something
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
goes wrong if they aren't there
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
get it back to me
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
that is exactly the same model here and
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
in fact the analogy does so well that
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom of this when you see that
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
data section at the bottom
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
that is the encrypted data it's inside
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
the envelope and it's sealed
 
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.709 align:start position:0%
the envelope and it's sealed
so

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
in this analogy the post office can't
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
make sure you're not getting junk mail
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
right because it doesn't know what's
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
inside the envelope
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you have to have this information
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the delivery so with the the
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
destination address i have to know where
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
to carry those bits for you and with the
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
return address if there's errors or that
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
site that you gave the information to
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
so i think that the um
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think we we've pretty much wrapped up
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
the the key parts of this um
 
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
the the key parts of this um
the

01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
based on some of the the other testimony
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh the bad actors i i think it's
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's salient to bring up that
 
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.669 align:start position:0%
i think it's salient to bring up that
that

01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
is when a a user is interacting on a
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh end point a website that is sharing
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
their information
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
that bad actor in this case this is not
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
the isp that is the the bad actor and
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
saying hey you need to go and police all
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
the traffic and find out how this could
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
have happened it it puts it puts the isp
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
technically in a challenging position of
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
how to
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
how how do i go and solve this problem
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
with technology uh and i don't think
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
that that's the
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's an easy challenge
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
wrap up thank you again for the
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and testify with you
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
guys today i
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
hope uh
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
if there are questions i'm happy to take
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
we do have questions so representative
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for coming
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
to testify before our committee um
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
so there are many different layers to
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
this uh there's browsers there's there's
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh messaging apps that you talked about
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's the tor browser i once put in
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
a bill to have our lot state libraries
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
run tour notes so
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
privacy is very uh interesting to me
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit about you
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the header that goes uh that's
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
like the address on the outside of the
 
01:21:47.679 --> 01:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
like the address on the outside of the
envelope

01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't uh cell phone companies and i
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
think maybe uh it could be that cable
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
providers do this too don't they inject
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
something called
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
like a i think verizon calls it a
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
connect id
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
that they inject a number into that
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
headers so that
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
sites can identify trace you back to
 
01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.470 align:start position:0%
sites can identify trace you back to
your

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
your provider of origin
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak to verizon or their
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
business practices
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh so i i don't know on that front uh on
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
the technical side how to address that
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay i mean it's a pretty common thing
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
so if you have t-mobile att verizon
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
you can go in you can opt out of that
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
marketing id and if you look at
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at the data coming across
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
the you know the wire you can
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
see that if you're not opted out you'll
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
have that id injected into it if you opt
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
out that that is supposed to go away and
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think it does
 
01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
i think it does
um

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's one way that isps can
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
track you but there are
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
lots of things that isps don't see i
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that
 
01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:57.990 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that
um

01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
a customer can use a vpn for instance
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
right and that would shield a lot of the
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
data from
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
the isp at that point wouldn't even know
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
what your endpoint was
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
with you is that correct
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
it would know the end point of the vpn
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
right so there's still you're still
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
asking the isp to deliver traffic but
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes obviously vpns are are one of the
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
the options that are available to
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
consumers um it's an additional level of
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
privacy on top of the confidentiality
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
and integrity provided by docsis which
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
the cable um again hybrid fiber coax uh
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
realm uh where we offer
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
security of that communication vpn adds
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
another layer to that he brought up tor
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
yet another layer on this so consumers
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
have the ability to
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
continually obfuscate that technology
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned in my testimony uh
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
dns is also going through an encryption
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
something called do which is dns over
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
https and dot which is dns over tls
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
two different
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
methods of encrypting dns traffic
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
and that's available to consumers as
 
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.030 align:start position:0%
and that's available to consumers as
well

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay i agree you're you're a nerd okay
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
um i have a technical question too
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that is that i've been watching
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
these tv ads where a guy's showing up
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
in everybody's mailbox and while he's
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
he's pretending like he can read
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
anything in your mail
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then he
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
says over his back as he leaves the yard
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know they can see everything you
 
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
uh you know they can see everything you
do

01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the ad is running on tv i think
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like one an hour
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
and so i'm do you know what the hell
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's all about
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sorry i have not seen that ad
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh i i may be in a different tv market
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
than you well but the reason the reason
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
i bring it up is because you mentioned
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
post office and made a connection
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
between how the postal uh office
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know delivers to your address
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
your information and all your mail and
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
then he turns around and says oh by the
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
way i i can read all this mail anyway
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what the ad says would you
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
believe forget what they're trying to
 
01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
believe forget what they're trying to
sell

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
sell
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe it
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing this ad and i i have no idea
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
what it's about representative herbert i
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
will say that when we talk about
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
encryption and the confidentiality that
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
encryption provides um there's actually
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
two things that happen in
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
common encryption where there's actually
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
encryption and some checksums to make
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
sure that both confidentiality and
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
integrity of your messages is guaranteed
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
through delivery
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
once that's encrypted without having a
 
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
once that's encrypted without having a
key

01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
key
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
to one of the the sides of that
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
encryption if it's if it's shared or
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
having the recipient key if if you're um
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
at reading it without those keys you
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
cannot see what's inside encrypted
 
01:26:10.719 --> 01:26:12.310 align:start position:0%
cannot see what's inside encrypted
traffic

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
so the take home here is make sure
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you committee
 
01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:25.189 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you committee
uh

01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
we'll switch gears here a little bit
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
jason hennessey
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
good morning well good morning um
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
well i'm happy um my name is jason

hennessey i'm here uh representing
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
myself i'm from the the wonderful town
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
of amherst
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to enthusiastically support
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
hb 1413.
 
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.470 align:start position:0%
hb 1413.
so

01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of my qualifications i have
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
over 15 years in the computer industry
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
about 10 years
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
as a researcher completing my phd in
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
computational sciences and statistics
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
at four years post-doctoral studies in
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
computing topics at boston university
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
i've published researchers
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
published researchers and widely
 
01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.629 align:start position:0%
published researchers and widely
respected

01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
respected
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed venues on related topics
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
including security privacy and
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
system-related topics
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
in modern computing technologies
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
including a few that have received some
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
media attention
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
and so i want to i want to talk a bit
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
about this bill and i thank you guys for
 
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
about this bill and i thank you guys for
listening

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
listening
 
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:42.870 align:start position:0%
listening
so

01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
hb 14 hp 1413 basically codifies what
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
most of us expect when you buy internet
 
01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.550 align:start position:0%
most of us expect when you buy internet
service

01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
you you're not expecting them to capture
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
every website you go to
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're not expecting them to sell your
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
location for instance if you have one of
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
um you know there's evidence that at
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
least as of a couple of years ago they
 
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.030 align:start position:0%
least as of a couple of years ago they
were

01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
your location information was being sold
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
and that's not affected by the location
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
toggle on your phone because they have
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
to know where you are based on the
 
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.070 align:start position:0%
to know where you are based on the
towers

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
towers
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
having this information all collected
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
together remember it's not just you
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's everybody
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so they know you know so it's
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
possible in these in these databases
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that were being sold to whoever had a
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
credit card i suppose
 
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.350 align:start position:0%
credit card i suppose
um

01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
it could be used to do you know for
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
marketing that's but that's one of the
 
01:28:30.159 --> 01:28:31.030 align:start position:0%
marketing that's but that's one of the
most

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
innocuous uses
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know imagine a stalker imagine uh
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a political rival having
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
access to all this information
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that was that's just location
 
01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.229 align:start position:0%
and that was that's just location
privacy

01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i want i want to address a little bit
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
of what i just heard the gentleman
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
before talking about he talked a lot
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
about encryption and uh i'll just say
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
that that is part of the story and there
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's a bit of stuff he left out
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
so isps like comcast or verizon or
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
whoever whoever you have
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability to track which sites
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
you go to
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
even with encryption
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's turned out that metadata which
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
is the data that um talks about who
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're talking to which which sites your
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
your devices are is talking to
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
that actually has a large percentage of
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
the usefulness of even the unencrypted
 
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.270 align:start position:0%
the usefulness of even the unencrypted
data

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the fact is that the isps can tell
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
which sites are going to because there's
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
a thing called sni built into the
 
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.229 align:start position:0%
a thing called sni built into the
encryption

01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
encryption
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
um which actually reveals which site you
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
go to so for instance if you go to
 
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.550 align:start position:0%
go to so for instance if you go to
pancreaticcancer.com

01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
pancreaticcancer.com
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know these isps know that
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
and i want to address representative
 
01:29:41.199 --> 01:29:42.310 align:start position:0%
and i want to address representative
ammon's

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
ammon's
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
um question on uh tracking ids
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
they it turns out that these isps
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing right now that i know of
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
that prevents them from selling which i
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
p address you have so whether they
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
insert an id or not doesn't really
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
matter if this if this information is on
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
the open market just like the location
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
information is
 
01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.189 align:start position:0%
information is
um

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter that information is
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
all is all out there
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that there's a lot of
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
peer connections peer-to-peer so like
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
computer to computer uh that reveal who
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
you talk to
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
even in encrypted protocols like signal
 
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
even in encrypted protocols like signal
um

01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.669 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
um when they said that you don't know uh
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that the isps don't know what you
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
watched on netflix the literature has at
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
least been out there for a decade
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
that there are these things called side
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
channels which can look at an encrypted
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
stream and and figure out with pretty
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
good certainty what you actually watched
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
and this isn't just theoretical i
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
actually had a research project with
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
high school kids
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
um who who actually replicated that and
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
and they were able to get a publication
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
out of that but the basic the basics
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
have been there for years
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
at least a decade
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and so this bill is actually
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
very very targeted it only targets the
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
isps and you heard you heard other
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
people talking about um well you know
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's google and facebook and all
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
these things well those are optional you
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
can get by in society without using
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
facebook or google i try to
 
01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:14.709 align:start position:0%
facebook or google i try to
um

01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
but the fact is you cannot operate in
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
the society without having internet
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
access you know if you don't have a cell
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
phone if you don't have home internet
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
you can't do things you can't even do
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature stuff right you guys are
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
on the email all day
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
um i don't know how you keep up with it
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
god bless you
 
01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
god bless you
but

01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
but you can't do that without getting on
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
the internet in the first place
 
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.390 align:start position:0%
the internet in the first place
so

01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
so this bill is very narrowly targeted
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
at at what society needs i mean there's
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
even people who say that internet access
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
is a human right right and if we can't
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
get on without being completely
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
monitored where we go
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
then you know how are we going to
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
function in a society when the people
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
who hold this data
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know start working against our
 
01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
you know start working against our
interests

01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
interests
 
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.870 align:start position:0%
interests
so

01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
um i want you to be to think about that
 
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.229 align:start position:0%
um i want you to be to think about that
also

01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of location
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
information uh at least as of 2019
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
all of the major wireless providers were
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
selling it to intermediaries
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
and this um and this wasn't just
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
a theoretical oh they might get
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
ads or something like that the reason we
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
figured this out is because there was a
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
sheriff county sheriff who was using
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
this to keep tabs on like people like
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
judges and state police
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
now thankfully he was caught and
 
01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
now thankfully he was caught and
convicted

01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
convicted
but

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
you know how many people like if you can
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
just get this information like what else
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
is going on with it and what do we what
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
do we not know
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh when this practice came to light
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
um mobile company said that they would
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
end it and at least as as of a year
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
later they did not there was an article
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
um i plan to send you guys uh talking
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i i can just say i personally
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
checked they had one of these one of
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
these location reselling sites actually
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
had a site you could go to and look
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
yourself up
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and so i did that and i actually
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
it i actually saw myself it showed me
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
just where i was with the location
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
turned off and everything
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
take this a step further there was a
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
somebody figured out that that site had
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
a bug in it a security bug and you could
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
look up anybody in the country without
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
them knowing
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
so anybody in the world could have just
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
taken a phone number
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
plugged it in and tracked that person
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
now think about think about all the
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
domestic violence think about burglaries
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a real issue and this
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
the the consent that these companies
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
have is is buried and obscured and i
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
would argue that it's not informed
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
consent for instance uh i took a look at
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
att's privacy policy it was 27 pages
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
verizon's is 20 pages
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
and and a lot of times even if you read
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
the privacy policy it does not spell out
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
hey we sell all your your browsing and
 
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.629 align:start position:0%
hey we sell all your your browsing and
your

01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and your location information you
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
know it's not very clear even if you
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
these these companies thrive on a lack
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
of informed consent
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
so hp 1413 simply codifies the common
 
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.229 align:start position:0%
so hp 1413 simply codifies the common
expectation

01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
that these companies are not doing that
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'll also point out you heard a lot of a
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
concern and problems and things like
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
that i'll point out maine has had this
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
for years now and the sky has not fallen
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
last i checked i mean i haven't been
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
there recently but maybe somebody who's
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
been to maine can tell me that
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i think you can still get internet
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's still reasonably priced
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
the fact is that they won their
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
challenge at the district level as far
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
as i know at the federal district level
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
so this is past constitutional muster
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically exactly a copy of
 
01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:44.790 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically exactly a copy of
that

01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
thankfully plagiarism is legal in laws
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the exceptions that you see in 359 t4
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
address pretty much all of the problems
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about in terms of
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
getting information
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
um um you've also heard that
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
we we should wait we should pause we
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
should not do this we should wait for
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
federal legislation
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i'll tell you that the telecom
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
industry spent 100 over 100 million
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2016 in order to defeat
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh the federal the federal protections
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
for privacy and brought in broadband in
 
01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:23.669 align:start position:0%
for privacy and brought in broadband in
2017.

01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
i've i also heard somebody mention that
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
this would only apply to people in new
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire and how are we going to figure
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
that out well i would argue that comcast
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
really knows where you are because you
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
know you don't usually change your home
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
very often
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is pretty basic
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's most of my testimony and so if
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
anybody has questions i would love to
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
entertain them
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett did you have
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of you are talking over our heads
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you that
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
um but one of the questions that came up
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
from the ag's offices enforcement do you
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
have any suggestions on how um if this
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass how it would be
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
enforced oh thank you representative
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
bartlett oh i would like to point out
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that there's a that the private
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
right of action is is good um the the
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
tcpa actually does this the federal tcpa
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
where um if you get junk calls in your
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
phone on your mobile phone or if you get
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
faxes you can actually take them to
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
court in in a state court and enforce it
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
privately i would rec my recommendation
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
would be that you would be that you guys
 
01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:31.510 align:start position:0%
would be that you would be that you guys
um

01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
make a change to basically step up the
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
penalties to be for the ag's office uh
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
to be the same as the private penalties
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
because that would allow that would
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
allow the ag's office to to sue on
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of the consumers
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
which in a lot of times they have more
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
technical expertise and resources in
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
order to do that the consumer protection
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
law in new hampshire is built around
 
01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
law in new hampshire is built around
restitution

01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
restitution
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
so you would have to show
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
actual economic harm
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i i would argue that the the invasion
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
of your privacy is a difficult to
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
quantify harm and that um it is the job
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
well again that's you know why we we
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
created the consumer protection act is
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
created the way it is because it was
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
just no we we can't we can't do that we
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
have we have triple damages
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
but you got to show some damage you got
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
to sow some economic harm so so i mean
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
the you know i guess the question is
 
01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.189 align:start position:0%
the you know i guess the question is
what

01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
how much do you value the ability of of
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
a person who's fleeing from her love for
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
her ex-lover and is being stalked
 
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.470 align:start position:0%
her ex-lover and is being stalked
well

01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
it is criminal but what if no what if
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
but what if they're using these tools to
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
find them i mean what's the what's the
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
private what's the private what's the
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
what's the value of your privacy and
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's why i would argue that rather
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
than needing to do what you classically
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
did which is show show damages um
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
as a society i think new hampshire
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
rights i mean we just passed a
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment guarding our
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
privacy and i would say that in new
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire we value it very highly
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative thank you
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
i was very impressed with the attorney
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
libman i hope i pronounced that correct
 
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.030 align:start position:0%
libman i hope i pronounced that correct
report

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
um in layman's terms something that i
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
could understand
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
would you tell me how
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
this bill goes above and beyond what the
 
01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:27.830 align:start position:0%
this bill goes above and beyond what the
federal

01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislation does
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not an expert in federal
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislation whenever i look at federal
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
law it has a million cross references
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i get overwhelmed
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that there is
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
that in 2017 all of the federal privacy
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
protection acts for broadband were
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
rolled back after over 100 million
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in lobbying
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
as far as i know there is no federal
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
protection other than the ftc saying
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
what you put in your privacy policy you
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
have to follow
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
but that's very but again these privacy
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
policies are 27 pages or 20 pages
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have like legalese terms
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
the average person
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe can
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
can is going is going to read at a and b
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
is going to really understand all the
 
01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:18.390 align:start position:0%
is going to really understand all the
implications

01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you i
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:55.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chair vice
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee um so i'm
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to be recapping a lot of what
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
people have already said so i'll try and
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
keep it brief my name is jake lestock
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here today on behalf of ctia
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
we are the trade association that
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
represents the wireless communications
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
industry and i'm here in opposition to
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill would put unworkable
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on how isps or internet
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
manage customer information
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
and would have unintended consequences
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
that would negatively affect the
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and consumers of your state
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
we'll start off by pointing out that
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
federal and state law already exists to
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
protect consumer privacy the federal
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
trade commission
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
already has authority over isp privacy
 
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.189 align:start position:0%
already has authority over isp privacy
protections

01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
protections
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
they have for the past 20 years
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
developed and
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
enforced an effective privacy framework
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
that applies to all
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
players within the internet ecosystem
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
and as was mentioned before the new
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire attorney general also has a
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
ability to address unfair deceptive
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
practices with relation to privacy
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
through your consumer protection laws so
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
there really is no gap
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
in privacy protections that the state
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
needs to address at this time
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
additionally this legislation is going
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
to create two sets of rules for various
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
entities within the internet ecosystem
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
and we have to remember the internet has
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
changed a lot a lot of speakers have
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussed this i mean we're not using
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
stationary computers with one isp now
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
we're using
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
multiple devices connecting to multiple
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
isps accessing content from multiple
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
edge providers so
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
imposing these strict opt-in
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
requirements on isps
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
is going is not going to protect
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
consumer privacy online um in fact it's
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to make a lot of confusion for
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
consumers in your state as
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
essentially it's going to create these
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
two levels and they're not going to be
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
able to determine which is which and
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
what is being protected and what is not
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
so uh i think the gentleman from cable
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
ads mentioned this a lot uh
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
there is important uh privacy
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
protections in place through encryption
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
around i think he mentioned ninety
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
percent uh of websites are encrypted so
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
isps are not able to see what you're
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
viewing on those websites
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
additionally virtual private networks
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
were brought up
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
and when these vpns are in place which
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
are available to all consumers in your
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
state isps cannot see
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
even the domain name that you're
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
accessing so there are important
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
tools that are already in place that can
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
help you with these privacy protections
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
if you feel the need to have more
 
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
if you feel the need to have more
additionally

01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about these sweeping
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
and inflexible opt-in requirements on
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
isps it does go against or at nearly uh
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
goes in at odds to nearly every other
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation or law or framework
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is in place in the country right
 
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.510 align:start position:0%
that is in place in the country right
now

01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the private right of action is going
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
to put a lot of businesses in new
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire at a risk of costly litigation
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
when it's likely to have little benefit
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
for consumers in your state and then
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
finally as was mentioned before there is
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
a bill that was similar to this that
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
passed in maine but it is still being
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
challenged in the courts
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
so kind of just wrapped up everything
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
people have said already but
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions i'm happy to
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
answer we do have a question yes
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and um
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
definitely not some of the learned some
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
new stuff today thank you
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
can you tell me approximately how much
 
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.750 align:start position:0%
can you tell me approximately how much
money

01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:38.470 align:start position:0%
money
do

01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
the internet and cable providers make
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
every year on selling our privacy
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
because i know it's done
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
i personally am not able to tell you
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
first of all i only speak on behalf of
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
the wireless industry so there is i mean
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
like i said a very
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
broad array of wireless players within
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
the internet ecosystem and i'm not going
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer uh exactly
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
the number of that but i'm happy to look
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
into it if you want me to follow up
 
01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.109 align:start position:0%
into it if you want me to follow up
afterwards

01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for the question main
 
01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for the question main
choir

01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
choir
 
01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.350 align:start position:0%
choir
um

01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.229 align:start position:0%
um
what

01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
what issues do you seeing in maine that
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
you so if this bill is following the
 
01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.470 align:start position:0%
you so if this bill is following the
main

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
main
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
law that just passed
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
as i said uh
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
we filed a lawsuit at the u.s or the
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
main district court in 2020 and that uh
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
litigation is still ongoing uh and as
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
was mentioned before
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh the decision to impose uh
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
this unique burden on isps alone is that
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh is that
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
represents discrimination uh on behalf
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
of the first amendment so those are the
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
issues that we're seeing
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
further questioning you say
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
discrimination for these individuals
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
what about the right to my privacy and
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
everybody else in this room
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
and across the state that have the
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
have their right to have their privacy
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
and not have their information sold
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
obviously privacy is an important thing
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we believe that privacy issues are
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
better addressed by a holistic approach
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
at the federal level as the internet is
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
inherently interstate and goes across
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
straight state lines
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
testimony having no more cards
 
01:45:35.199 --> 01:45:36.390 align:start position:0%
testimony having no more cards
um

01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.830 align:start position:0%
um
we

01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
let's see um rick fabrizio from the bias
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to it and from the overnight we
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
had three
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
three in support and two opposed
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the public
 
01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:59.910 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the public
hearing

01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.199 --> 01:47:39.109 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.119 --> 01:48:19.669 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
life

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%

is

01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:20.310 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.599 --> 01:50:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

items containing perfluoroalkyl and
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
pluri polyfloral alco
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
substances be labeled before being sold
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
water supplies have been contaminated
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
with pfas in new hampshire and currently
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
there is a factory that continues to use
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
pfas and manufacturing and makes toxic
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
releases into the environment on a daily
 
01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.189 align:start position:0%
releases into the environment on a daily
basis

01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
there are several pfas contamination hot
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
spots in new hampshire where cancer
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
clusters are being discovered and folks
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
who are participating in biomonitoring
 
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
studies are beginning to receive results
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you get a little bit
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
closer oh yeah sure
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry about that oh yeah
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
to work okay
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are several pfas contamination hot
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
spots in new hampshire where cancer
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
clusters are being discovered people who
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
are participating in fire monitoring
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
studies are beginning to receive the
 
01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.310 align:start position:0%
studies are beginning to receive the
results

01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
and they are very difficult to interpret
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
if it were you you would want you would
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
be glad to be in the study
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
you would want to stop using pfas
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
chemicals and you would want to know
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
where they are and if you have them in
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
your life unknowingly
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
if you follow the guidance that is
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
available you know that you have to
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
clean your home very carefully test and
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
filter your water and decrease the
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
presence of pfas in your life in any way
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
that you can
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire passed
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to set max contamination
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
levels to extend the statute of
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
limitations to prove injury
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
with pfas
 
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
with pfas
to

01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
test wells and we have instituted an
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
array of measures that have raised
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
awareness and put the harmed in a better
 
01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:45.990 align:start position:0%
awareness and put the harmed in a better
position

01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
but as community members some of us have
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
come together to educate one another
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
about how to decrease
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
our exposure to pfas
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
you have an information sheet that is a
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
print out of pfas new hampshire fact
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
sheet as well as an faq
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
that goes with it and the cinco
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
infographic is a result of a
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
non-legislative act where myself and
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
another legislator set out to find
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
someone to help us teach people what
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
a committee formed involving researchers
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth college new hampshire
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
health and human services des
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
and cdc community representatives and
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
the fact sheet is the result of let's
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
say about 18 months worth of work maybe
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
it is a pdf online and it is hosted at
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
the dartmouth medical school website it
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
is updated
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
on i think it's a six-month basis
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i have sent that to you in an email
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
so that you would have the dynamic
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
document where you can click through
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
and get to the resources
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the last year i looked at
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
all of our legislation and i visited
 
01:53:56.159 --> 01:53:57.830 align:start position:0%
all of our legislation and i visited
saferstates.org

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
saferstates.org
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
website to see how new hampshire is
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of his striving to be a
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
safer state
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of pfas
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
and i was happy to see that we are
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
considered to be a safer state and that
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
our efforts have been listed there and
 
01:54:12.639 --> 01:54:13.669 align:start position:0%
our efforts have been listed there and
including

01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
this effort which goes into the future
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the efforts of other states to try
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
to combat the same problem
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
there are labeling bills in other
 
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.430 align:start position:0%
there are labeling bills in other
legislature

01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
in the country and in fact
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
almost all of
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
the efforts in legislating and educating
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
about pfas have been designed to empower
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
people so that they can live their life
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
with as little
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
mystery and as many choices as they can
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
possibly make
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
so when i wrote the bill
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's taken from a michigan bill that
 
01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.430 align:start position:0%
it's taken from a michigan bill that
contains

01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
contains
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
the most comprehensive structure that i
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
could find to serve as a basis
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
i spoke at length with a representative
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
who filed a short form bill in vermont
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
and that's where you make a statement of
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
a bill that you would like to
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
study and if the committee decides to
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
accept it they work on it and they come
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
up with a bill if they think it's a
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
feasible idea
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
he didn't think his bill was going
 
01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
he didn't think his bill was going
anywhere

01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure about some of the other
 
01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:15.990 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure about some of the other
bills

01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is a very challenging bill
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
and it has some flaws
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
and but what it tries to do is to tell a
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and distributor to label
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
products to be sold in new hampshire
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
that contain pfas as such
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
it is just a warning that simply says
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
contains pfas and packaging or item and
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
has been linked which has been linked to
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
cancer major illness and reproductive
 
01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.229 align:start position:0%
cancer major illness and reproductive
harm

01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
harm
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
i've included in your also in your info
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
packet a couple examples of labels that
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
could be applied after the fact
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
on stock that people already have and
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking in my mind as i'm writing
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
this bill that someone wants to buy a
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
set of pots and pans and they go into
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
the store and they want to look at the
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
label and see does this non-stick
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
pan was it manufactured with pfas or not
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
is it going to raise my
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
exposure to pfast when i'm cooking
 
01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.149 align:start position:0%
exposure to pfast when i'm cooking
so

01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
back to the bill
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think i heard the word teflon yes
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about teflon and gore-tex
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
and anything that
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
has waterproof coating we're talking
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
about the inside of food packaging where
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's slick and nothing sticks to it
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about glide
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
dental floss we're talking about
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
waterproof eyeliner
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a lot of
 
01:56:32.159 --> 01:56:33.270 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a lot of
different

01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
items that
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
some of the things are
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
listed and resources that i've sent in
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
your email and also what you have there
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
in front of you
 
01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:45.270 align:start position:0%
in front of you
so

01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
i have sent you a few resources
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
including informations
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
in your email on the recent findings on
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
the cancer cluster
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
study that's going on at dhhs
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
for people who are in the vicinity of
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
the saint-gobain
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
performance plastics in merrimack if you
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
are unable to access this file let me
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
know it's a big file so i couldn't email
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
it to you i had to put it on a cloud
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere and then supposedly you're
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to view it
 
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
through your microsoft exchange
 
01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.990 align:start position:0%
through your microsoft exchange
so

01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that's where that is for you
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
but as again i said the bill intends to
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
empower new hampshire families to have a
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
modicum of control over bodily
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
contamination it is known that all of us
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
have pfas in our blood it is thought to
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
be found in the blood of creatures all
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
over the world
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
in places where these chemicals were
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
never used or created including at the
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
north pole
 
01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.430 align:start position:0%
north pole
and

01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
examine the bill in light of the
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
foregoing facts and understand that it
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
is an adaptation there are known
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
barriers to this
 
01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.470 align:start position:0%
barriers to this
process

01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
i know one of them is interstate
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
commerce laws which i know very very
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
little about
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
when it was adapted through ols
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
it did the
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
definition of department and i want to
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
say that would be
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't refer to des and so the
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is rather irrelevant
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
because it's not des that would be the
 
01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:27.350 align:start position:0%
because it's not des that would be the
department

01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill that i adapted this from
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
the department was described as
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
licensing and regulatory affairs and i
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
asked for the
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire complement to that to be
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
listed as the draft month i didn't get i
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get the fiscal note or the whole
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill back until just before christmas so
 
01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
bill back until just before christmas so
um

01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there were a lot of things
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed in the bill
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
present it and i welcome any questions
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
i will do my best to answer them and
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:59:08.239 --> 01:59:09.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
okay

01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um my question is
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
this given the difficulty of enforcing
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
this and the cost to enforce it you know
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
there must be thousands of products that
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
have this um
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering first of all
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
would this
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
maybe be a good idea to follow the gmo
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
labeling which is based on the usda
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
and um and secondly maybe it makes more
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
sense to for this to be voluntary given
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of consumers that
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't want this chemical in their
 
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
products i certainly don't and just like
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
gmos we seek out
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
products that have the no gmo labels
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
might we do the same thing with pfas and
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
it would be a good marketing tool for
 
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.430 align:start position:0%
it would be a good marketing tool for
companies

01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
honestly i think that's extremely
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
innovative and that's why i bring this
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill to this committee because i hope to
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
have that kind of expertise i think if
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
it could be a voluntary thing and there
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
were no fines involved that it would be
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
a far better bill
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i also agree that people want to
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
show you that they're not going to
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
poison you and people are really
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
becoming aware of the extent of this
 
02:00:22.639 --> 02:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
becoming aware of the extent of this
problem

02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
so did i answer your question thoroughly
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
you did thank you so much thank you
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative abel's first
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you so much for uh
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
testifying for introducing the bill
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
i noticed in one of the uh uh
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
sets of material that we were
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh sent around
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh that there is an example of
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh of a label that says that indicates
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
that cal the state of california has
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
decided a particular product
 
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.109 align:start position:0%
decided a particular product
might

02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
contain some
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
particular dangerous materials and it
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
reminds me that we had it we've had
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
bills in the past
 
02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.189 align:start position:0%
bills in the past
where

02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
there were substances in furniture and
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
so forth and in one case
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
there was a decision to say that if the
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
state of california had declared
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.109 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would use that as its as
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
its way of of regulating it uh figuring
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
that that's a big market we're a tiny
 
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
that that's a big market we're a tiny
market

02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm con my question my question
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
is how would how could we
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
do labeling so that a manufacturer
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have to have 50 different labels
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
for each state who wanted it a different
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
way but we could make it as easy for
 
02:01:57.119 --> 02:01:57.990 align:start position:0%
way but we could make it as easy for
them

02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
to do it and what your thoughts are on
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
that and perhaps in amending this bill
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
in some way
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative abel i would be extremely
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
open to having amendments to the bill
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
that would include that type of
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
to me it seems to be a very very
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
solid idea that
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know if we would do that
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
but i would imagine that we would say if
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's labeled for california it works
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
here but i'm not sure exactly how we
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i think if the label meets the
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
requirements which are very simple
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what's in the bill then

question
 
02:02:53.119 --> 02:02:54.790 align:start position:0%
question
so

02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
do you i know that you sent us this
 
02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:58.149 align:start position:0%
do you i know that you sent us this
information

02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
and you listed some um products that
 
02:03:01.199 --> 02:03:03.189 align:start position:0%
and you listed some um products that
have

02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
pfas in it um we heard a bill earlier
 
02:03:07.599 --> 02:03:08.629 align:start position:0%
pfas in it um we heard a bill earlier
um

02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
this session
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
and there is a lot more items than what
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
you listed and i've got the list here
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%

02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
there are so much more
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
than what you have indicated
 
02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.430 align:start position:0%
than what you have indicated
and

02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
i really think that how do we
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
get all these manufacturers from all
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
these different industries
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
for just new hampshire and and
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is new hampshire
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're not california
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
and i worry about new hampshire i don't
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm having a
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
little difficulty parsing the question
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
well they will leave it as a would you
 
02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.950 align:start position:0%
well they will leave it as a would you
believe

02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
there are literally hundreds and
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
probably thousands and thousands of
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
things that contain pfas and i think we
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
need to start but i do think that we
 
02:04:20.550 --> 02:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
have to remember that we are in a global
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
market almost all of the time and that
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
when things are manufactured all kinds
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
of labels are put on them and the
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers seem to be able to know
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
where they can sell the items and what
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
fair enough uh
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to kind of play devil's
 
02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.910 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to kind of play devil's

and whatever has a label on it now
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
i have a cell phone just like
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
virtually 100 of everybody else in this
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
room it has a label on it
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
what do we do with it
 
02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:10.709 align:start position:0%
what do we do with it
and

02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.239 --> 02:05:15.109 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
what is that going to mean to me except
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's got a label on it
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
could you kind of help me out with that
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a choice i want i'm
 
02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a choice i want i'm
just

02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%

02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
you you will have a choice about what
 
02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.589 align:start position:0%
you you will have a choice about what
you

02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
want to buy
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to want to buy the thing
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
that has the lowest amount of risk for
 
02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.350 align:start position:0%
that has the lowest amount of risk for
you

02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
and if it's an item that contains pfas
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to want to make sure that i
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
mean a cell phone i would not be so
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
worried about i would be more worried
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
about food packaging
 
02:05:47.599 --> 02:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
about food packaging
and

02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
like frozen dinners that type of thing
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
but in terms of like like a stable item
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's standing you know
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's not decomposing it's not going into
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
landfill it's not touching something
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
that you're going to eat it's not makeup
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
going into your eye
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know we have to look at the kinds of
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
objects that you're looking at to decide
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
where the safety lies for you
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
right so you're saying you we need to
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
pick out those items that are really
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
consumable or things that we're going to
 
02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:21.189 align:start position:0%
consumable or things that we're going to
be

02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
have a high
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
probability of getting coming in contact
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
with the pfas product
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
so you don't expect to put a big giant
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
label on a car
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
a new car no
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
no no there's a lot of um chips and a
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
lot of pfas in a car i'm sure of it yeah
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
but you would have the parts of them
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
you would want it on your pots and pans
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
where you're going to be at the stove
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and you know that the coatings on pans
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
wear out and you know you can only
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
imagine i bet some of it goes in your
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
dishwasher and some of it goes down the
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
drain but some of it you eat so
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
and that's tough so when you buy your
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
pots and pans you want to know can i
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
have non-stick or is it totally out do i
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
turn to wax paper now instead of to the
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
insides of these boxes that are coated
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
with plastic that we'll never get rid of
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to stand the test of time
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
and be gone long after man is here
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
no we we want to just do what we can
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
today to make it a longer and better
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
life for the people who are here
 
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing this bill you know
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of issues with it
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
but one of the things i think that's
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
been really really valuable um through
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
this exercise would you believe that i
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
think that i mean until two weeks ago i
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know that that
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
dental floss had pfas in it and that's
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to go right into my bloodstream so
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think the education
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
value for this bill is tremendous
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
so don't
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't be discouraged if we kill it but i
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.149 align:start position:0%
think that
that

02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
all of this whether we're in favor of
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
regulation or not
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
or labeling or not
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
are learning
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
about what what pfas is doing um and i
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
think that the conversation will
 
02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:06.709 align:start position:0%
think that the conversation will
continue

02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative i
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that and that is
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
really why we're here i mean
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
we know that the bill has flaws and we
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
know that it's an attempt and we know
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
that i mean it really has some flaws
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
but i would love it if you if if the
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee fell in love with the bill and
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's something about it that could
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
just be a single thing that would help
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
but i really think that
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know when i come into a committee
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
this i think is my fourth time
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
presenting a bill that's related to pfas
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if that committee knows
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
about pfas and what they know about it
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
but by the time you get over to the
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
senate you're talking with people is the
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
word is getting around and that you
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
don't have to start at the beginning of
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
the story anymore and so i'm really
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
grateful that you already have some
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
experience under your belt and that
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
you're here looking out for consumers in
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
i think this committee gets a how
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
insidious it is it's
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere so
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
chair we'll call on uh representative

thank you and good oh noah good
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon pull the mic close this okay
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
how's that you're gonna we'll learn when
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
we get on the house floor these mics are
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
really good to be close to
 
02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
really good to be close to
okay

02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and good afternoon chairman
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
hunt and honorable members of the
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
commerce committee my name is
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative wendy chase and i live in
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
rollinsford and i represent stratford
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%

14-22
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
and as it was says we do know that there
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
are a lot of flaws that needs work but
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
the thing is the awareness and to get
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
the word out that this is something
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's put into our bodies all the time
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
and we should have that option
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
of at least being educated and aware
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
i did give a testimony i'm not going to
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
go through everything because you a lot
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
of it is stats
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
i also sent you some documents via the
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
little portal that we have i wasn't able
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
to print those out but they are
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
interesting especially i'm part of the
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
peas study for pfast i live in the
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
seacoast i received my test results back
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
without any real
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
explanation as to what they meant my
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
levels are high but what the heck what
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
how did this happen so there's um i i
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately could not print it out so
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that you will take the time
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
to just look at that and understand
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
what's given back to
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
the residents that are in the study
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
without any
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what does it mean do i tell
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
my doctor am i supposed to be aware of
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
things now what what is this health risk
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and how did it happen that's why we
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
want to be able to uh to let people know
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
so i am very proud to share that my
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
family has lived in new hampshire for 11
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
generations and we've resided on the
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
seacoast for the past 70 years
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have a severe pfas issue here in new
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and throughout the state
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i do feel very strongly that our
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
residents have the right to and deserve
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
to know where pfas is found in the
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
products that we use daily
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
so with the warning labels again it
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
could be something very basic but it's
 
02:11:53.669 --> 02:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
just so that when you pick something up
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
like the gmo and you say oh this
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
contains gmo i don't really want to use
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
it what do i have an alternative that's
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
accomplish or be
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me aware of
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i won't tell you what pfas is but it
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
is in here in since 1960 the fda has
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
authorized several broad classes of pfas
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
for use in food containers substance due
 
02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:18.550 align:start position:0%
for use in food containers substance due
to

02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
the non-stick and grease oil
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
so sorry
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the water resistant properties as we
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
were just talking about
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
so they have some of these been deemed
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
that they're not harmful but
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
over the years this does create problems
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
in our our blood systems so to ensure
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
the food contact substance are safe for
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
the intended use the fda has conducted a
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
rigorous view of scientific data prior
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the authorization for market entry
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
this includes viewing the data's
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
migration of the food contact substance
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
into the food
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
expected consumer exposure to the food
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
context substance and
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me from this
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
the other uses in food and potential
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
health impacts from the exposure
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
p fats that are authorized
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
for use in contact with the food
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
generally fall in these application
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
categories and i'm really basically
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the food and what we are
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
ingesting so we know the non-stick
 
02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
ingesting so we know the non-stick
cookware

02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
cookware
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
gaskets and o-rings that are used in
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
food processing equipment
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
pfest may be used in the resin
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
in forming a certain parts of the food
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
processing equipment that requires a
 
02:13:38.719 --> 02:13:40.229 align:start position:0%
processing equipment that requires a
durable

02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
durable
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
chemical invisible i'm so sorry i need
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
processing aids may be used for
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
food contents
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the polymer what it does is it
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
reduces the buildup on the manufacturing
 
02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
reduces the buildup on the manufacturing
equipment

02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
so again even though
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
it may not be right in our food it is in
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's being used in the machinery that is
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
processing our foods so here's a little
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
bit more that's added it's in
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
paper bags and paper board it's in used
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
as a grease non-proof
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
agent for wrappers microwave popcorns
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's in pet food bags
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
and this gets leaked into our
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
land it gets leaked into the water and
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
also exposed into the air
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
so even though the recent efforts to
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
remove certain p-fats from
 
02:14:37.679 --> 02:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
remove certain p-fats from
commerce

02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
have reduced the likelihood of exposure
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
some household products and indoor air
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
or dust
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's been a long morning thank you
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
so some of these products in
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
indoor air and dust may still contain
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
pfest so even though we're trying to get
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
this squared away it is still found as i
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the beginning of my
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
testimony i did grow up on the sea coast
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
hampton's north beach to be exact and
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
there are so many documented pfest
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
areas of contamination northampton and
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
parts of portsmouth greenland have some
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the highest pediatric clusters in new
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
england my daughter
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
first born was diagnosed in 1987 with
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
ewing sarcoma at the age of two
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
ewings is a rare bone cancer and it's
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
childhood cancer but it is one of the
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
highest known cancers caused by pfast
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
so was it with the water that i drank
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
growing up the playing fields that i
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
played in in my youth was it the local
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
eggs the vegetables or the meats that i
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
consumed that would have caused my child
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
to develop such a rare cancer and i'm
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
not saying that pfast is the cause of
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
that but it really gives me the food for
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
thought yikes i live in an area with a
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
cancer cluster this is a number one
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancer and my baby
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed at two years old
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
something's not right
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
so i also sent as i said my pfas study
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
results which i would like you to take a
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
look at if you can because if you can
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
decipher it please get in touch with me
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
and let me know i have been in touch
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the pfas study group
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
explained that i really felt
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not given the information i needed
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
and what are you doing to try to help
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
people understand do we talk to our
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
doctors what are we supposed to do once
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
we get these results
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
very very bad vague information and i
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
can send you those replies too if
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
anyone's urge
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
wants to know
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
so anyway the bottom line is i don't
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
know we all i know i have high levels of
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
pfas i don't know where they came from i
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what that causes in
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
my health
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not the only one it's something that
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
i really
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
hope that you consider to think about
 
02:17:02.709 --> 02:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
amend whatever we have to do to work on
 
02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
this to be able to let the public know
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
what is actually in the products that
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're using
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
and let them make the choice as to what
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
they want to buy and what they don't
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
want to buy
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's it i want to thank you so much
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the water i want to thank you for
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
and if there are any questions i'd be
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
happy to ask
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
who is ultimately responsible for all
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
the pfas that's in
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
our waters our lands in the air
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
all over the world that's a really tough
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
it i don't know really where it started
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
but it um
 
02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
but it um
3m

02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
3m
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
is a big contributor
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's in gore-tex it's it's in the teflon
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
pans i mean they're the ads of to help
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
the housewives with this great new pan
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
that's a non-stick and that was way back
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the early 50s this has been around a
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
long time it's also
 
02:18:11.599 --> 02:18:12.469 align:start position:0%
long time it's also
in

02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
you know fertilizer so we know that our
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
animals are getting affected as well so
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you who it's everywhere and
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's all over the world
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
just to follow up for the question main
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
question would you believe it's the
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
chemical companies oh yes i understand
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
that i'm sorry i thought you were asking
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
representing greece
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking our
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions i think the next bill needs to
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
be we need to ban the periodic table
 
02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:46.709 align:start position:0%
be we need to ban the periodic table
um

02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
more realistically is are there what
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
kind of manufacturing may be down in
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
your area that perhaps the residues or
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
the byproducts of manufacturing
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
questionably dumped into the water we
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
had another representative sponsor bill
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
and there was some manufacturing in his
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
his district it had been proven that
 
02:19:11.110 --> 02:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
they were dumping
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
pfas or i think is pfas actually
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
into the water supply
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
in his district
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
is there is there any manufacturing of
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
such like in your district as well that
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
narrow that narrow the look into because
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
to say it's it's everywhere so we need
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
to ban all chemicals
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh is is
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
not not even possible but if we can find
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and and specify
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
that it's coming from here and if
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
they're doing something illegally or if
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing something
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
negligently or whatever that's a whole
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
different issue
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
entirely than trying to slap a label on
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
every single product
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question and yes
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
and also we're not trying to ban
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
chemicals that's not what we're trying
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
to do we're trying to just we need them
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking to help the consumer
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
understand what they're putting in their
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
body as we do with other things yes
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely 100 percent peas air force
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
base that's where our area of the sea
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
coast has had the most problem in that
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
um i mean it's been being looked at
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
things have been stopped it's a lot of
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
the foam that is used on the airplanes
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
to put fires out and things so what i
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
would forget what exactly that foam is
 
02:20:27.359 --> 02:20:29.670 align:start position:0%
would forget what exactly that foam is
called

02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
called
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
and it thank you and what's happened is
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
it's been used for years and years and
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
years my dad was stationed there and and
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's gotten into the land it's gotten
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
into our water it's gotten into our
 
02:20:40.479 --> 02:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
into our water it's gotten into our
landfills

02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
it gets into our fish it gets into our
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
oceans but the other thing is we have
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
coakley landfill which is a superfund
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
spot so when the epa came in to clean
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
that up
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
what they did is they put a cap over it
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
well that
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
great for a little bit but it it's still
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
seeping underneath so all of what we're
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
finding with that cancer cluster i was
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
telling you in the seacoast area
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that's that superfund is still
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
leaking and it's leaking from underneath
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
and it's getting into the waterways of
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
the the developments and the people's
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
houses and homes and wells in that area
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
so no we don't have a
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
saint-gobain but we have peas air force
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
base a lot of
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me again that's where a lot of
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
that research is coming from from the
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
peas that i talked about i should have
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
said what it was
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
because the water is very contaminated
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
people are sick
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
childhood learning center there you know
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
these are kids that are being exposed
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
and drinking that water for years this
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
has been going on for years
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that's where the level in the testing
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative for taking
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
my question and i hope you don't mind if
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
i get a little personal because i know
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
you've been public about that public
 
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
about this um
 
02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
about this um
does

02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
does the medical community in new
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire believe that your daughter's
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
death um i i forget what age she was
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
when she died was in any way related to
 
02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:25.110 align:start position:0%
when she died was in any way related to
pfas

02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
question that's again very difficult
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
because there's no way of really telling
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
how she developed that cancer i was
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
actually just telling representative
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
vale i am in a pediatric
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
long-term survivor study right now
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's being done through
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
baylor college and also with dartmouth
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
hitchcock so what i'll be doing next is
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
sending out some of erin's baby teeth
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
and they're taking all of this
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
information and trying to see what was
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
it in the dna what happened
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
back then can we get a little bit better
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
idea of how
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
a two-year-old would end up with an
 
02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:06.469 align:start position:0%
a two-year-old would end up with an
enormous

02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
02:23:06.479 --> 02:23:08.070 align:start position:0%
enormous
bone

02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
bone
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
growing tumor
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
so no i've even asked her oncologist and
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
i've asked her orthopedic oncologists
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
i've asked her orthopedic oncologists
too

02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
geez could pfest have been there and and
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
it always brings me they'll talk about
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
the the wolburn the woburn area
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
that was years ago but remember all the
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
kids the big cluster so yeah nobody can
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
say yes or no but it's definitely you
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
know it makes you think well wait a
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
minute so i cannot answer what caused
 
02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:37.349 align:start position:0%
minute so i cannot answer what caused
her

02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
her
 
02:23:37.359 --> 02:23:38.710 align:start position:0%
her
cancer

02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
have a feeling it could have definitely
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
been a good part of it
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay
 
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes you have to pull pull it pretty
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
close to you
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
there can you hear me closer
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
believe it or not
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
see how close i am okay so um
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think the pfos is is tragic my husband
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
works for the department of
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
environmental services so i get to hear
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
about what's going on at the state level
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
and the invest investigations into the
 
02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:19.349 align:start position:0%
and the invest investigations into the
various

02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
various
 
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
areas and the difficulty that they're
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
having meeting the requirements or even
 
02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:26.710 align:start position:0%
having meeting the requirements or even
identifying

02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
the potential exposures
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
but my concern with this particular bill
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
is in the enforcement
 
02:24:34.399 --> 02:24:35.190 align:start position:0%
is in the enforcement
um

02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
because as i read the enforcement which
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
obviously if we're gonna if we're gonna
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
be able to make progress here we have to
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
be able to hold people accountable and i
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
think labeling is a great idea
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
um but there are some things in the
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement that i really don't
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand like why you might have gone
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
in that direction because
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
some of it is is related to holding a
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
person accountable instead of an
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
organization or a manufacturer or
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
um so so i i was questioning that um i
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
see that there's civil fines but
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
if this is i'm wondering if there's a a
 
02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:16.469 align:start position:0%
if this is i'm wondering if there's a a
criminal

02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
or consumer protection angle that should
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
be addressed and the other thing i
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
noticed was the um
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
that it would be done at a county level
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
but because pfas is so extensive it's
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
got to cross county lines it's got
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
across state lines it's got to cross
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
international borders so
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know how a county prosecutor or
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
attorney general could hold
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
someone accountable i think
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it should be at a higher level i
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't know i'm just wondering where
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
the enforcement component of the bill
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
came from
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and so are
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
we no actually
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
what um
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
as representative vale had said this was
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
based off of michigan who has a there's
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
a senator who has put a bill in i think
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
about four years ago i did talk to her
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
about it it's kind of just in a
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
stalemate right now so
 
02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:10.630 align:start position:0%
stalemate right now so
we

02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
use that as the concept of what the bill
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
should be and both of us yes we've
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
talked a lot on this and we've talked
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
to represent
 
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry senator hassan's office we've
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
had talks
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
zoom calls trying to just figure this
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
out because we know this is not just a
 
02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:31.830 align:start position:0%
out because we know this is not just a
state

02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
issue so we wanted to also in involve
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
our federal
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
representatives as well and see what's
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
going on at the federal level and try to
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
figure this out and also as
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
representative bale said even with
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
vermont which is the other state that we
 
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
know that's trying to do something with
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
labeling everything's kind of at a
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
standstill right now and this is why we
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's awareness we really want to bring
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
this forward we'd like to know
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done you're absolutely
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
right it's hard and we sat and scratched
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
our heads like well how are we going to
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
penalize this one person and what about
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
things that are already on the shelves
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
if the law were to go into effect so
 
02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to say it this is a food
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
for thought this is something that i'm
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
hoping others will join on board with us
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll really pick this up when we
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
rewrite it we amend it whatever we do
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's the awareness that this seems to be
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
in our minds the next step of letting
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
consumers understand what's going on and
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
not having it in the isolated areas of
 
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
merrimack and their water or the

02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the fish that are being caught it's

the awareness and we just want to be one
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
of the first to really do something
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%

uh one more card left kirsten koch from
bia

02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
yes we have made it into the afternoon

members of the committee my name is
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
kirsten koch and i'm the director of
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
public policy for the business and
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
industry association also known as bia
 
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to express ba's
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 14-22
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
ba fully acknowledges concerns
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
surrounding the contamination of
 
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
perforated chemicals in new hampshire's
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
natural resources
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
but today my testimony will address the
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
feasibility of implementing this bill at
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
the state level in the business
 
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.389 align:start position:0%
the state level in the business
community

02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
baa believes the house bill 1422 would
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
be impossibly burdensome for
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and retailers to implement
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
into practice
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
this mandate would affect businesses in
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
nearly every single industry
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is even going so far as to
 
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to regulate commerce at a state
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh regional national and international
 
02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:43.429 align:start position:0%
uh regional national and international
level

02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1422 requires the state to
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
evaluate and regulate nearly every
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
product manufactured for sale in new
 
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
product manufactured for sale in new
hampshire

02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
in addition to identifying violations
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
and enforcing fines
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
this bill would be especially damaging
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire small businesses
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
because they do not have the resources
 
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
because they do not have the resources
to

02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
monitor and label the sale of every
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise legal product in new hampshire
 
02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.270 align:start position:0%
otherwise legal product in new hampshire
furthermore

02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
multi-state businesses need uniformity
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
and law to effectively ensure their
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
ability to consistently apply
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion bia respectfully
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
requests this committee to vote for a
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
motion of inexpedient to legislate
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
this policy should be addressed at a
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
federal level and the burden this bill
 
02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
creates should not fall on local
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
businesses nor the new hampshire
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services so
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your consideration of
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
our position on this legislation and i
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
would gladly try to answer any questions
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for for uh coming and
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
testifying um
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
based on an earlier bill we heard you
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
may not have been here then
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
and this one that also
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh talks about
 
02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
the possibility of handling things on a
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
on a federal level or an estate level i
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
i just wonder if
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
if if you or the bia has a has a
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
viewpoint on what's appropriate
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
to be done at a state level
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
when when there's an issue
 
02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:23.670 align:start position:0%
when when there's an issue
where

02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
regulation could be done on on
 
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
on both the federal and the state level
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get a sense of what
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
is appropriate for a state to try to do
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
and what is best for the federal
 
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
government to regulate
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative we believe this policy
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
should be addressed at the federal level
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
multi-state businesses need their
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
uniformity and
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know be incredibly difficult if not
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
impossible for the state to regulate
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
every single product that comes into new
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire for sale i mean this bill even
 
02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
addresses uh products that are sold over
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
the internet and you think about amazon
 
02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
and how popular that is today i just it
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
would be impossible for the state to
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
address that so that's why we believe
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
that this policy would be best addressed
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
do you even have this on your radar
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
as an issue that's affecting new
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:28.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
consumers

02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%

02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
our highest priorities and we fully
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the concerns surrounding
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
pfas and and i commend you know the
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and the co-sponsors for
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
addressing uh this topic and bringing
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
further question
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
thanks i just want to follow up um a
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
little bit if it is a top priority
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
could you give us an idea of what
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
the discussions are
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
and any kind of other than just saying
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's a federal problem
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
any kind of solution that might be
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
proposed or discussed with your members
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
we believe that pfas
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
policies and regulations should be set
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
on science-based policy and
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
generally you know this type of policy
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
is best set at the epa on the federal
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
level but we're just looking for
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
science-based policy and not just
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
arbitrary measures so our concern is
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
just maintaining that science-based
 
02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:35.429 align:start position:0%
just maintaining that science-based
policy

02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for your testimony um
 
02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:41.830 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for your testimony um
yeah

02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
while i agree that this should be
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
addressed at a federal level
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
i would want to know why you would say
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
that the burden isn't the responsibility
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire department of
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question well it
 
02:33:59.110 --> 02:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
would be their burden um and we don't
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
think it's it's reasonable or realistic
 
02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:02.469 align:start position:0%
think it's it's reasonable or realistic
for

02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
this burden to belong to just the depart
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire des we believe this
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
issue is much larger
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
than maybe even something that could
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
handle it should be addressed at the
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
something this bill is missing
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
especially in the fiscal note is that it
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't address
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the cost for lab testing and what it
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
would take to evaluate and identify you
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
know thousands of products that are for
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
sale in new hampshire and we just don't
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
think they have the staff the resources
 
02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
to possibly even carry out what this
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill would require
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire it does
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the question yep
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
so my question then is if you don't feel
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
if you if you
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of the develop
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services if
 
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
not to address
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
polluting our environment i'm
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know my husband works for the
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services so
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'm finding this a little bit of a
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
stretch for me
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for your question
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh let me clarify uh we
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe in the capabilities
 
02:35:12.399 --> 02:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe in the capabilities
of

02:35:13.750 --> 02:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
des here in new hampshire
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
we just think that what this bill
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
requires is so large and so costly that
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much thank you
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
i have no more cards um
 
02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
i have no more cards um
the

02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
sign in sheet was blank
 
02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:35.429 align:start position:0%
sign in sheet was blank
and

02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh or the overnight we got
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
seven in support into an opposition
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
 
02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:51.110 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
hearing

02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:32:18.870 --> 03:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:18.880 --> 03:32:23.510 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:23.520 --> 03:32:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
he implied that some states allowed this
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
or something did he
 
03:32:32.070 --> 03:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
think that that was true or something
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
in his testimony
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see how it could i mean perhaps
 
03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
the state law in another state allows
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
more flexibility but it still would be
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
preempted by federal law so
 
03:32:50.469 --> 03:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.479 --> 03:32:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:02.070 --> 03:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
so do we have what what do we have now
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
for short-term policies do we have
 
03:33:06.150 --> 03:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
anything now
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
we have we do have a company that does
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
offer short-term policies there's just
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
one though
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
so there aren't very many out there and
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
what what's the need because i remember
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
one time it was like ten thousand
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
the benefits are very limited um i
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you what the benefits in
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
the policy that's being sold in new
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire at the moment i could get back
 
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
to you but a lot of people do buy these
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
policies without understanding they're
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
as limited as they are
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
even things like um
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
while the new hampshire insurance
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
mandates apply to these policies there
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
they can do pre-existing condition
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
exclusion so
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
virtually anything that would have a
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
state mandate would they could put in a
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conclusion
 
03:33:50.790 --> 03:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
condition and not cover that services
 
03:33:52.229 --> 03:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
for that type of thing
 
03:33:52.239 --> 03:33:53.030 align:start position:0%
for that type of thing
so

03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:54.870 --> 03:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
in general um there have been some
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
national reports put out around
 
03:33:58.469 --> 03:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
short-term policies and some of the
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
consumer dissatisfaction with them um
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
but uh but new hampshire's experience is
 
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
pretty limited
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
do you get complaints for people once
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
they realize what they bought i'm not
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:13.750 --> 03:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
but it's only six months now right in
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
our our that policy with the
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
right the nature of the policy we have
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that's true yeah i
 
03:34:22.710 --> 03:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
um yes i think it's six months with one
 
03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
um yes i think it's six months with one
renewal

03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
six months with one renewal so you could
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
technically get a whole year
 
03:34:33.910 --> 03:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.920 --> 03:34:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
you just shovel yeah but here a lot of
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:48.239 --> 03:34:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
all right john can i ask tyler questions
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
can i ask tyler
 
03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
can i ask tyler
um

03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:01.040 --> 03:35:02.469 align:start position:0%
um
tyler

03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
tyler
 
03:35:05.110 --> 03:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here
 
03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
we've talked many times in the past
 
03:35:08.830 --> 03:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
about how
 
03:35:13.510 --> 03:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
um destabilizing the the
 
03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
um destabilizing the the
insurance

03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
policies could impact premiums and cause
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
overall premiums to go up in the state
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
because of the inability to have the
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
stability that we need and we've had
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
this conversation countless times over
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
the last couple years how do you think
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
this would impact
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
premiums in the long term
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so your question your question is
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
very loaded and right on i mean to the
 
03:35:40.229 --> 03:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
extent you could create an opportunity
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
for healthier people
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
to leave the the heavier that the more
 
03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
regulated market go into something like
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
a short-term policy or an hp something
 
03:35:50.469 --> 03:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
that has a premium that that would
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
benefit them being healthy you draw
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
those healthy people out of the larger
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
market and then and then you're left
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
with sicker people who pay more in terms
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
of their premiums the
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
in this case because the federal law has
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
certain requirements um it would preempt
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of state flexibility so while
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
you could have some seepage some leakage
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
from the regulated market in terms of
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
healthy people um it would be less
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
though than if those healthy people had
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
a more permanent
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
option um in the short-term policy arena
 
03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know when we when we passed senate
 
03:36:24.070 --> 03:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill 7-eleven so paul and i are probably
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
the only ones in the room who remember
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
all that
 
03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:28.389 align:start position:0%
all that
and

03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
and uh everybody else i think is
 
03:36:33.190 --> 03:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
missed out on that fun
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
um so we actually passed you know the
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
affordable care act long before
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
then it actually became federal law
 
03:36:40.880 --> 03:36:41.910 align:start position:0%
then it actually became federal law
and

03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
and the the whole debate around that
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
original bill was
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
it was what was it what was the company
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
called was it pine tree or pine uh
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
pineapple or
 
03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
it was someone that they were very
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
golden rule that's right golden rule
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's it golden rule
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
and and the rule the goal the golden
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
rule was as soon as you made a claim
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
you got cancelled
 
03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:12.070 align:start position:0%
you got cancelled
so

03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
the policies were great and as long as
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
you never made a claim right but as soon
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
as you made a claim is you were they
 
03:37:18.560 --> 03:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
as you made a claim is you were they
somehow

03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
03:37:21.510 --> 03:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
just non-renewed you
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and that and that really is what
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
how we got into passing community rating
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
03:37:27.600 --> 03:37:28.389 align:start position:0%
in the first place
so

03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:30.630 --> 03:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
seeming you know assuming in this case
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know these these
 
03:37:34.309 --> 03:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
policies we have now these short-term
 
03:37:34.319 --> 03:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
policies we have now these short-term
policies

03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
policies
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
which you know that
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
they violate you know you know they they
 
03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
probably have caps right do they have
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
we know the one product we have in this
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
market what the cap is
 
03:37:52.229 --> 03:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
we don't know we apologize uh yeah
 
03:37:52.239 --> 03:37:53.269 align:start position:0%
we don't know we apologize uh yeah
okay

03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested to know what the one
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
product we have do do you know the camp
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know paul
 
03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:10.870 align:start position:0%
you know paul
yeah

03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
who who's the one company that is
 
03:38:12.560 --> 03:38:13.590 align:start position:0%
who who's the one company that is
selling

03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
selling
 
03:38:17.349 --> 03:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
there's one company
 
03:38:19.359 --> 03:38:20.150 align:start position:0%
there's one company
right

03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
well i'd be interested to know some of
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
the details on it i think
 
03:38:26.229 --> 03:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
before we kill this bill that i think we
 
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
should at least know what what's out
 
03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:28.630 align:start position:0%
should at least know what what's out
there

03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
and what is there i mean obviously
 
03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:32.469 align:start position:0%
and what is there i mean obviously
you're

03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
you would argue that you would go cobra
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
but you know cobra is hugely expensive
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
when you're paying the employer portion
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know you're playing the poison so i
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
assume these these short-term policies
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
are fairly inexpensive
 
03:38:45.439 --> 03:38:46.229 align:start position:0%
are fairly inexpensive
um

03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:47.830 --> 03:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
they tend to be
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
less expensive but not the benefits are
 
03:38:53.349 --> 03:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
not proportional so the proportional the
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
benefits would be much weaker versus the
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
lower cost well
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
the benefits meaning that they they
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
so what's the benefit of putting this
 
03:39:06.080 --> 03:39:07.750 align:start position:0%
so what's the benefit of putting this
off

03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to know if we're going to
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
make a case for why we're not going to
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
i think we need to be able to tell
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
people what's what is available what is
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
that that short form policy is
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
so at least we can articulate that and
 
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
know what know exactly
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
what is going on with the marketplace
 
03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
another another question from a consumer
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
protection kind of perspective you know
 
03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:31.670 align:start position:0%
protection kind of perspective you know
and

03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
i mean sadly because
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
if you have one of these short-term
 
03:39:36.880 --> 03:39:38.309 align:start position:0%
if you have one of these short-term
policies

03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
policies
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
and people aren't educated i mean like
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
my husband got cancer out of the blue we
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
didn't he was never sick at the end of
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
his life it was just a freak thing and
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
next thing you know we're we're in
 
03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:49.750 align:start position:0%
next thing you know we're we're in
trouble

03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
are there any safeguards for people who
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
i would think in some in a case like
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they'd probably consider it a
 
03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:02.830 align:start position:0%
that they'd probably consider it a
pre-existing

03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
exclusion i mean that yeah i mean the
 
03:40:07.189 --> 03:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
safeguards typically are when you lose
 
03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
your insurance coverage you have access
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
to the marketplace the exchange and um
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that's guaranteed issue and normally
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's really the big
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
difference now even before past 7-eleven
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
or even when the affordable care act was
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
first you know was that that
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
we now have a very active thriving
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
marketplace for individuals
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
subsidized by all of us
 
03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:38.950 align:start position:0%
subsidized by all of us
so

03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
so so the premiums are not as bad as
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
so it's uh and
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
so theoretically yeah where it basically
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
drives people into the marketplace
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
which is what you you know if you're if
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
your employer or whatever you're not
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
gonna you would normally would not
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
hold out for your next employer if you
 
03:40:58.950 --> 03:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
were changing jobs you would just go
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
so you really
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even buy one of these
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
short-term policies anyways there's not
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
as much demand for it for sure i would
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
think that i would think now the
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
marketplace is fine
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
for you
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
you guys uh representation grayson who
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
are kind of
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
new to all of this um are you following
 
03:41:22.150 --> 03:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in terms of
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
the the difficulties of this short you
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
know what he the bill which was to take
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
the short-term policy and try to make it
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
available which clearly violates federal
 
03:41:34.150 --> 03:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
law but uh but in terms of you know what
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
what people need to know is that yes
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to go to the marketplace
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
and get an individual policy
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
you guys comfortable with that you
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
understand that yes i'm generally aware
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
of this uh mr chairman although i
 
03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be tested on it right
 
03:41:50.319 --> 03:41:54.229 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be tested on it right
now

03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
so how are you leaning right now i mean
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
03:42:00.550 --> 03:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
how are you leaning
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
well i mean i i wouldn't pass this bill
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
no i would never pass the bill the
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
question is you know whether interim
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
study so we can work you know talk about
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
it or learn about it but i before i'd
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
rather i'd rather
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
let's wait just that's late to learn
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
about what the policy is
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then before we decide to say
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
something okay yes holly
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
why don't you come forward you have to
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
you have to have a mic
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i think we're i think we're online i
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:41.110 --> 03:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.510 --> 03:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
for the record holly stevens i represent
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
nami i did a little bit of research
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
while we were i was back there just kind
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
of googling okay the one plan in new
 
03:42:50.880 --> 03:42:52.630 align:start position:0%

a member of the ihc group whatever that
is

03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
is

independent america american
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company insurance company
 
03:43:12.309 --> 03:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
never heard of them they've got a number
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
of different plans depending on
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
deductible amount and out-of-pocket
 
03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:18.070 align:start position:0%
deductible amount and out-of-pocket
amounts

03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
but the one um important thing that i
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
think is worth noting is that
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
it says for every single plan that is
 
03:43:27.510 --> 03:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
listed um
 
03:43:30.070 --> 03:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
for me i put in my birth date and that
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a non-smoker and that i'm a female
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
no coverage for outpatient prescription
 
03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:39.750 align:start position:0%
no coverage for outpatient prescription
drugs

03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
for any of their plans
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
it has no drug plans no drug plan at all
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
so the one provider in our state does
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
not provide any coverage for
 
03:43:50.399 --> 03:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
not provide any coverage for
prescription

03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
03:43:51.840 --> 03:43:53.510 align:start position:0%
prescription
medications

03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
medications
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
that could be somebody who would want
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
that plan you know i mean if you're
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
young i mean we're assuming that most
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
people who take these are young people
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
so i mean that they might not want a
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
drug plan
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
but does it say anything about the
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
premiums what the hell
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes depending on the deductible amount
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
like there's one where there's a
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
deductible of ten thousand dollars
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:44:17.199 --> 03:44:18.070 align:start position:0%
um the
uh

03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
premium is 179.
 
03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.790 --> 03:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
but i can't tell from here though what
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
benefits are covered what they actually
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
cover right i can't tell if they cover
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
mental health or substance use or
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
maternity or anything like that i'm
 
03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
assume all those wonderful things are
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
not being covered i would assume that as
 
03:44:39.760 --> 03:44:43.269 align:start position:0%
not being covered i would assume that as
well

03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking you were talking about a
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
truly catastrophic type plan
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
so i just offered that to you chairman
 
03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
um because i found it online
 
03:44:53.680 --> 03:44:54.469 align:start position:0%
um because i found it online
right

03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:44:54.479 --> 03:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
right
great

03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
if young people are buying these
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
policies is that what's happening yeah
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
well that that's who i always thought it
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
was yeah
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
well we should force them into a system
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
where they subsidize us old people right
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's that is the current that
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
is the current law yeah the current law
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
is really built around the idea i was
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
it was tongue-in-cheek but yes
 
03:45:22.870 --> 03:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that uh
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
the whole point of community rating
 
03:45:27.269 --> 03:45:27.279 align:start position:0%
was that and
 
03:45:29.189 --> 03:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
and right from the day one for the
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
original battle was the age banding
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
and actually when we tried and the age
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
banding now is what three and three
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
point five and ones and we did have
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
three and a half to one three and a half
 
03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:40.630 align:start position:0%
three and a half to one three and a half
to one

03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
to one
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i when we
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
i always said when when we tried to
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
revisited the non-group market
 
03:45:51.750 --> 03:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
and um we at the individual market we we
 
03:45:51.760 --> 03:45:52.830 align:start position:0%
and um we at the individual market we we
actually

03:45:52.830 --> 03:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
removed age banning altogether we
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually brought it back this was under
 
03:45:57.760 --> 03:45:59.269 align:start position:0%
actually brought it back this was under
benson

03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
benson
 
03:45:59.279 --> 03:46:01.030 align:start position:0%
benson
and

03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:03.269 --> 03:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
and i always said the mistake i made at
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
was that i just removed all age banding
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i should have left in some age
 
03:46:12.070 --> 03:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
banding because we absolutely had
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that came in and said all of
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
a sudden they were they were paying you
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
know outrageous amount of premium
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
and uh it was because they were
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
you know the upper end
 
03:46:25.269 --> 03:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
because once you get 65 your your
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
medicare right so so if you were 60
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
years old
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
the premium was was i think in this case
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
i think it was like 12
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
to 1.
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
it was that that huge of a band
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so i always said the mistake was i
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
should have made it six to one
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
and that that maybe it wouldn't have
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
been as bad
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
um and we might not have
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
end up
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
so yes the idea is that you now it's
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
interesting because
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
i remember new york they had no age
 
03:46:59.680 --> 03:47:01.030 align:start position:0%
i remember new york they had no age
banding

03:47:01.030 --> 03:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
banding
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
there was one premium for everybody
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah in that case young people were
 
03:47:05.520 --> 03:47:06.469 align:start position:0%
so yeah in that case young people were
really

03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:47:06.479 --> 03:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
really
subsidizing

03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
subsidizing
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
the old people
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
but uh the age banding you know
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
obviously was we we did at that time i
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
think we were four to one three to one
 
03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
was it i think it was three to one
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't it paul i think it was originally
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
three to one
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that and the idea was that we would
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh at least
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
give some
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
but yes it's i have no doubt in my mind
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
that that the nature of insurance in
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
general and and the best the only reason
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
you can call health insurance insurance
 
03:47:39.030 --> 03:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
is that work that we're
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
assuming that uh
 
03:47:43.279 --> 03:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
assuming that uh
younger

03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
younger
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
healthier people
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
pay the premium because they think they
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
should have insurance
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
so i have some younger friends they like
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
to go rock climbing and they're very
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
healthy right so right if i were them
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be worried about falling and
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
breaking a leg or maybe getting cancer
 
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't be worrying about you
 
03:48:09.269 --> 03:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
know they're very fit
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
getting diabetes or something like that
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
right so right having them
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
have options i think is a good thing
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
it would be nice but we can't
 
03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the real world
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
but let me say the affordable care act
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.239 --> 03:48:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
there is an option for catastrophic
 
03:48:33.429 --> 03:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
coverage onto the aca
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
why call the catastrophic is the high
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
deductible that's what's catastrophic to
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
me it is
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
is that where you're going yeah it is
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
03:48:44.309 --> 03:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's not really catastrophic it just
 
03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
means it means you're going to pay all
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
out a pocket
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
until you you know
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars i mean i've never
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's huge
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i know
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a as in a small group as an employer
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
with small group i think the highest you
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
know i i think i'm paying now it's
 
03:49:06.150 --> 03:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
the height is 6 500
 
03:49:08.710 --> 03:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
so the first 6 500
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
is is
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
but you know the prem the premium is
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:25.590 --> 03:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay so see what you can find out i'd be
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
interested in how many people were
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
buying it
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
what's you know whatever you can find on
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
it yeah we don't have the number of
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
people who are buying it so not
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
something that's generally reported oh
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
you don't know you don't know
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
no no we don't but don't don't you guys
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
have to audit this company on a regular
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
basis um they may submit information
 
03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:45.429 align:start position:0%
basis um they may submit information
through

03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:49:45.439 --> 03:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
through
um

03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
well a company may submit information
 
03:49:50.150 --> 03:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
that is fairly basic
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
part of what we consider a survey but
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're pretty hands off with the
 
03:49:59.189 --> 03:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
assuming because there aren't too many
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
and there's not a lot of regulatory
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
i need
 
03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
i need
more

03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:14.710 align:start position:0%
more
info

03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
info
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
on current company okay
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:24.790 align:start position:0%
all right
next

03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:50:27.750 --> 03:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
relative requiring insurance coverage
 
03:50:30.150 --> 03:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
for vaccinations devices medications
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%

03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so this one
 
03:50:40.150 --> 03:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
did we have any evidence that that
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
anybody's been rejected or how do we
 
03:50:42.399 --> 03:50:43.429 align:start position:0%
anybody's been rejected or how do we
know

03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
that i think you sent out sent us out
 
03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
the question is is actually has there
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
been a situation where somebody was
 
03:51:16.319 --> 03:51:30.309 align:start position:0%
been a situation where somebody was
refused

03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.319 --> 03:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.880 --> 03:52:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:00.399 --> 03:52:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
i mean we could interim study it just so
 
03:52:05.429 --> 03:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
in case
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
something did come up
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
but passing it just for the sake of
 
03:52:16.150 --> 03:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
passing it i i
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't know do somebody feel that we
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
should do that
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
i like to keep less clutter in our
 
03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:26.309 align:start position:0%
i like to keep less clutter in our
statutes

03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:32.229 --> 03:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
the issue that's brought to mind uh the
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
concern of of representative gay
 
03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh is to ensure that
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are are covering
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
any injuries that are caused by
 
03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:50.070 align:start position:0%
any injuries that are caused by
vaccines

03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
and medicines that are authorized for
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
use by the fda under emergency use
 
03:52:55.199 --> 03:52:56.550 align:start position:0%
use by the fda under emergency use
authorization

03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
03:52:59.189 --> 03:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay right um there's a if there is a
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
chance or
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's a perceived threat that an
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company would not cover those
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
injuries you weren't taking that uh
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know as being uh on label or you
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
take an experimental vaccine yeah
 
03:53:13.590 --> 03:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
experience okay something like that so
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
an insurance company may not cover those
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
expenses because it was experimental
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
ensuring making sure that people are
 
03:53:28.710 --> 03:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
covered by those types of injuries
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the one of the
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
statements that came out during the
 
03:53:33.910 --> 03:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
original hearing was that the wording is
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
challenging and just needed to be
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
clarified that that's what the objective
 
03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
clarified that that's what the objective
is

03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:53:39.760 --> 03:53:42.150 align:start position:0%
is
yes

03:53:42.150 --> 03:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
i mean that's what i wrote so how would
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify we're talking about the
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
actual experimental service or the
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
problems that might develop from the
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
experimental service because if we're
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the problems that would be
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
considered discriminatory if a carrier
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
said well we're not going to cover that
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
because of something about you
 
03:54:01.359 --> 03:54:03.349 align:start position:0%
because of something about you
so

03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
so they don't have it's not about the
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company covering the
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
experimental drug right that's
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
completely different
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
but a an injury that that is as a result
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
um because remember it's it's it's a
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's authorized by the fda under
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
emergency use
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not a part of a drug trial
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh or anything like that i don't know
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
how that would be covered i'm sure
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's federal laws that govern that
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
not that
 
03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
but uh just making sure that that if if
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
you take
 
03:54:40.150 --> 03:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
a anything that anything
 
03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
that is authorized under even emergency
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
use authorization that any injuries that
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
are a result of that would be covered by
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
your insurance company yeah and it
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
really would be treated like anything
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
else i mean sure wouldn't be able to say
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going to cover it because of
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
how we're not going to cover your
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
condition because of how it was caused
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
that would be considered discriminatory
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.189 --> 03:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
i don't have it with me but there's been
 
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
several studies done
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
and several occasions across the country
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
that this has already happened
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
so ivermectin is not a uh is not an
 
03:55:26.070 --> 03:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
experimental drug i've ever met has been
 
03:55:27.189 --> 03:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
around for a while like the person who
 
03:55:27.199 --> 03:55:28.710 align:start position:0%
around for a while like the person who
who

03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:55:31.269 --> 03:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
brought it into won a nobel prize
 
03:55:33.910 --> 03:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay for medicine for for ivermectin the
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
problem with ivermectin is it is one of
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
the most successfully used drugs
 
03:55:41.830 --> 03:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the world ever safer than even
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
tylenol on a drug safety rating
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
but it has not been authorized for use
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
as a treatment for covet
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay it's been used but it is not the
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
fda has not officially approved it for
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
that use so anybody who uses it is using
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
it off label it's not illegal it's not
 
03:56:02.870 --> 03:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
horse paste
 
03:56:03.750 --> 03:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:56:06.150 --> 03:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
author it is an off label use and
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
doctors prescribe drugs for off label
 
03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
use all kinds of medicines it's not an
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
unusual practice but for some reason
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
other ivermectin gets labeled horse
 
03:56:17.830 --> 03:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
paste and people people are nut jobs for
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
taking it
 
03:56:20.790 --> 03:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
anybody who would use
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
ivermectin according to this bill if
 
03:56:25.680 --> 03:56:26.550 align:start position:0%
ivermectin according to this bill if
they

03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
ivermectin is not authorized for the
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
emergency authorities this is fda right
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't it wouldn't get covered
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
it would not because it's not authorized
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
for use under emergency you thought use
 
03:56:37.199 --> 03:56:38.710 align:start position:0%
for use under emergency you thought use
authorization

03:56:38.710 --> 03:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's already fda approved
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's interesting so that what you're
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
making argument is that we shouldn't
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
pass this bill because
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
this this i know this statute this is
 
03:56:51.750 --> 03:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
the off label statute
 
03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill originally in my memory
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
was originally it was
 
03:56:56.239 --> 03:56:58.469 align:start position:0%
was originally it was
um

03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
it was actually it was for cancer wasn't
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
it was a cancer bill
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
is my memory
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
and the and it was being pushed by the
 
03:57:08.229 --> 03:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh cancer society
 
03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
they wanted this off label
 
03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah were you around for that were you
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
around for this one there have been
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
several drugs that have been
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
developed and experimented and and use
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
it off label because they found an
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
application in cancer treatment and that
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
may have been it i'm not familiar with
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
that particular law
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
but this would cover for example the the
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh the cova-19 vaccines
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
that have been used for the last two
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
years now or a year and a half whatever
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
it is has been uh have only been
 
03:57:42.150 --> 03:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
approved under emergency use
 
03:57:42.160 --> 03:57:43.750 align:start position:0%
approved under emergency use
authorization

03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
03:57:43.760 --> 03:57:44.710 align:start position:0%
authorization
so

03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:46.229 --> 03:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we have on the market
 
03:57:48.150 --> 03:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's what people are getting now what
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
was approved by the fda is a is a
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
variety that is not even on the market
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
in the us called common arty
 
03:57:56.150 --> 03:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so what you are getting when you go
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
down to the clinic and get your shot is
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
actually authorized under emergency use
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
authorization so if you experience an
 
03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
injury for that
 
03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
the the the the motivation for this bill
 
03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
would be if you are injured by that your
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company needs to cover that
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
um because there's the the concern that
 
03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh they might deny
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
your your claim because you took an
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
and we're hearing from the hospital
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
their written testimony mr chairman
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that this bill begs
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
for work
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be by this committee
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
and by the way
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative greeson and i
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
have just come from a meeting with the
 
03:58:48.389 --> 03:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
speaker where
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
your method of operation is
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
praised as laudatory and exemplary for
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
other committees
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
which we already knew but we appreciated
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
him saying that
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
in the sense in the special regard that
 
03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
this committee actually works on fixing
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
bills that we deem to be deficient or
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
defective in contrast to other
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
committees the sponsors to go and fix it
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
which in this case might not necessarily
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
be the proper course of action unless we
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
want to work collaboratively with
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the sponsor because
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony that was
 
03:59:30.150 --> 03:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
submitted on the second by the nha
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
we were told and we confirmed that the
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill is in conflict with
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill right right in
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
other words the stated intent of the
 
03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
bill and the language of the bill
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
are contradictory anyway so i don't know
 
03:59:46.150 --> 03:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
how much time we want to spend on trying
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
to fix this today
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know whether or not you
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
want to consult with the sponsor on how
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
to fix this but clearly this needs to be
 
03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
fixed right
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
period thank you so the question
 
03:59:59.590 --> 03:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the question is the compliment
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i like that part
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
so the question is do we want to try to
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
fix this in the next couple of weeks or
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
should we interim study it and uh yes
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes i agree okay i asked all right
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:00:21.269 --> 04:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
you're welcome okay here we go so now

04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
i used to joke that other committees if
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's not 99.9 pure
 
04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
they just kill it on site
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i and i always thought that it's
 
04:01:30.870 --> 04:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
outrageous because
 
04:01:32.309 --> 04:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
and then they would say to the sponsor
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
you go make the amendment
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think well no no the bill belongs to
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
us yes
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
we've just experienced this in another
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
venue another committee and we were in
 
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
shock talked and furthermore we were
 
04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
told to fix it and then we were told we
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
were told to fix it and then we asked
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
what are we to fix and they said well
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
you figure it out
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
this is no way to do people's freshman
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative mind reading class that
 
04:01:55.120 --> 04:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
representative mind reading class that
day

04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
right so that but you went away
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
realizing how fortunate you are we are
 
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
by the grace of god i'm here okay
 
04:02:08.710 --> 04:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
next up uh relative co-payment and
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
services rendered by a chiropractor in
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
this case
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
we do have a sponsor
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
you want to come on up and
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
since we can never really get can't get
 
04:02:43.199 --> 04:02:44.150 align:start position:0%
since we can never really get can't get
you

04:02:44.150 --> 04:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
being paid more
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i guess there you go is it on
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
now yeah okay i'm sorry thank you
 
04:02:56.960 --> 04:02:58.150 align:start position:0%
now yeah okay i'm sorry thank you
um

04:02:58.150 --> 04:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
is we want to be
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:03.040 --> 04:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
a

04:03:03.910 --> 04:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:03:07.030 --> 04:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
a provider not a specialist
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
that reduces the co-pays
 
04:03:10.239 --> 04:03:11.189 align:start position:0%
that reduces the co-pays
um

04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it's all about
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
making it easy for um patients to to get
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
care um
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
i i'll give you a good example i mean i
 
04:03:22.150 --> 04:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
didn't realize i'd be having any
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
speaking role today so um
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
i had a new patient come in yesterday
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
and her insurance checked out that she
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
has a hundred dollar copay
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's insanity when i see and we talked
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
about this last week about how the state
 
04:03:39.840 --> 04:03:41.269 align:start position:0%
about this last week about how the state
has

04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
a special plan the teachers have a
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
special plan you know you're talking
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
five ten dollar co-pays specialists on
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
the state and teacher plan are thirty
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
dollars we run anywhere from forty to
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
sixty now i saw a hundred and i i would
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
so what what plan did she have what
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
company was it um you know i think it
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
was an anthem plan
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
well i
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
i can't uh
 
04:04:07.359 --> 04:04:08.150 align:start position:0%
i can't uh
right

04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:04:10.000 --> 04:04:11.590 align:start position:0%
i don't know
okay

04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
first i want to make sure everybody i'm
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
yeah let me change that independent
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
america no
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay so so basically that's what i'm
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking for it's not going to cost
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know any patient anything it's not
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
going to cost the insurance company
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
anything it should just reject reduction
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
in co-pays by taking us out of the
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
specialist category
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
and putting us into the
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
04:04:44.880 --> 04:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
primary care
but

04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has a copay and co-insurance
 
04:04:52.150 --> 04:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
no i understand but
 
04:04:55.830 --> 04:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
if you're under the specialist uh
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's it it is significantly higher
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to do is
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
reduce it make it easy for patients to
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
seek care
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
right okay so the one thing i want to
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
clear up you know let everybody speak
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
but that when you start talking about
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
the other the state employees and all
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
those other places those are riskes no i
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
i understand that but i'm just i'm just
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
giving some examples
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing i want to say
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
is as as being the person who was in the
 
04:05:22.319 --> 04:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
is as as being the person who was in the
room

04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
when we passed the legislation original
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with chiropractic
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
services right where we said that if you
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
if you offer it you got to give it you
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
got to give 12 12 months you know one
 
04:05:34.800 --> 04:05:35.910 align:start position:0%
got to give 12 12 months you know one
month

04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
right right that when we passed that i
 
04:05:39.439 --> 04:05:41.030 align:start position:0%
right right that when we passed that i
again

04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:05:41.040 --> 04:05:41.830 align:start position:0%
again
the

04:05:41.830 --> 04:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:44.150 --> 04:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
deal was that insurance company that was
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
if they did offer it
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
so at that time cigna
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
they're in the room
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
at that time cigna dropped it
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
obviously they now carry it because they
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
i know she was in the room when we had
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing so they now carried it but
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
that that that it was sort of like the
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
consequence of the law okay
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me for just a sec so i'll give
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
you an example of um
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think what uh insurance
 
04:06:11.600 --> 04:06:12.550 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think what uh insurance
company

04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
but um it's a fifty dollar copay
 
04:06:18.150 --> 04:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
and we get three dollars and ninety
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
cents from the insurance company
 
04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
i i just think that's unfair for the for
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
the patient because then they they think
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
they've got chiropractic care and
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
actually they don't
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
right 53. so you would rather just
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
run the risk of
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
dropping the carbohydrates so it's a lot
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
more convenient for patients to get in
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
without breaking the bank
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
so in terms of this language here you
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
would what what is the word that says
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
that would help you on
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
because all i see is that
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
so if that happens
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to think this through if
 
04:07:05.670 --> 04:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
this if that happened if that were to
 
04:07:05.680 --> 04:07:08.070 align:start position:0%
this if that happened if that were to
happen

04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
the provider is is still going to charge
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
x number of dollars this this assumes
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
that the insurance company decides to
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
continue coverage under this change
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's right
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
the provider is still going to charge x
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
number of dollars
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
what it means is that the patient is
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
going to pay a smaller portion of the
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
total number of dollars that are allowed
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
under the contract that the insurance
 
04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
company has with the provider which
 
04:07:33.920 --> 04:07:35.269 align:start position:0%
company has with the provider which
means

04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
that unless that dollar figure is
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
lowered in negotiation between the
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
insurance company and the provider the
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
provider the actual cost of the provider
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
is going to be greater because they're
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to be sharing a greater proportion
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the allowable cost because you've
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
reduced the copay let's say from fifty
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
dollars to ten dollars am i
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
but that's the implication i mean so on
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
the one hand you were saying that the
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
the uh the patient only has to pay ten
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
dollars instead of 50.
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
but what are the implications for the
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
insurance company unless the insurance
 
04:08:08.159 --> 04:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
insurance company unless the insurance
company

04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
contracts with you or or chiropractors
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
to lower the allowable
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
fee which you then have to determine
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
whether you accept right and if you
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't accept it then bye-bye right i got
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
this correct okay thank you right so in
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
this current scenario you're saying if
 
04:08:29.429 --> 04:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
it's a 50 deductible
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
and you're only getting 350 dollar copay
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me 50 copay and you're only
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
getting 3.95
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that that means well it's
 
04:08:39.120 --> 04:08:40.309 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that that means well it's
called

04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
four dollars right
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
that means the total amount of money you
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
got is 54 right
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
versus if you if we were to say that has
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be the same as any other physician
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
which is ten dollars
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean they're gonna raise
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
that four dollar that four dollars
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
well i think that goes back to contract
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
negotiations then right goes back to the
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely and then at that point they
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
might say
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
bye bye exactly
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh that we're not going to
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
cover chiropractor anymore yes
 
04:09:15.670 --> 04:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative johnson i know you want
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
why is your green a green means too many
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
too many lights around i'll take
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.159 --> 04:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i know one of the other things is to
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
be able to offer chiropractic to more
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
people for
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
health benefits
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
am i correct that's another reason why
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
we were this bill was brought forward to
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost so people can get
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
more health benefits out of the
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
chiropractic unless i'm mixing it up
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
with another bill but no okay
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
i know
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
the insurance company i now have
 
04:09:52.149 --> 04:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
they switched over because they saw the
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
benefits of chiropractic care
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
so my insurance company
 
04:09:58.389 --> 04:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
my health insurance company
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
took our
 
04:09:59.600 --> 04:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
took our
healthcare

04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
chiropractic and took them out of the
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
specialist and made them regular
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
providers it has done a wonders just for
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
my family alone
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
we are not seeing the doctors on a
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
regular basis we go
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
to our maintenance with our chiropractor
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it has saved us hundreds of dollars
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
going to a regular chiropractic going
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
rather than going to a doctor or a
 
04:10:22.319 --> 04:10:24.149 align:start position:0%
rather than going to a doctor or a
specialist

04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
just because of a chiropractic care and
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
if i remember in the testimony they also
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
talked about those who have back injury
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
or knee injuries
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
they go to a if they can go to a
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
chiropractor more often
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
they'll be less likely to get hooked on
 
04:10:42.399 --> 04:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
they'll be less likely to get hooked on
the

04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
opioids and the drugs which is what we
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
are trying to do
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
in our society is to help stop that
 
04:10:53.279 --> 04:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
in our society is to help stop that
correct

04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.110 --> 04:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
oh fargo
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
i have two issues
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
one when you um and tyler maybe you can
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
jump in here if you change the copay and
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
you keep the coverage then the insurance
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
company is paying more
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
than they were paying before because i'm
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
paying less and that's a drive on
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
not only would the insurance company pay
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
more for the existing patients that they
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
would otherwise would have had a
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
less a smaller percentage of the share
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
you may have additional people who get
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
chiropractic services because they'll
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
see the lower co-pay and those would be
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
new patients visiting the chiropractor
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
which again would increase the cost
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
overall utilization the original bill
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
was passed the theory was if people had
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
better access use chiropractic care more
 
04:11:52.239 --> 04:11:53.269 align:start position:0%
better access use chiropractic care more
often

04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
often
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
overall costs would be lower but it was
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
everybody assumed
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
lower cost sharing means you're going to
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
use those services more that's generally
 
04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
how it works with insurance
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
the other issue that i see that we have
 
04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
talked about for years is now you're
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
setting a precedent so tomorrow we're
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
going to have someone come in who is say
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
a podiatrist who says i don't want to be
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
a specialist anymore i should have the
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
same co-pay as a primary care physician
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
or your orthopedic guy or i mean
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
are we setting a president of precedence
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
and opening a door that any specialist
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
type of practice can come in and say i
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to pay the same the
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
nature of the profession is i think the
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
only other one would be a physical
 
04:12:39.279 --> 04:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
only other one would be a physical
therapist

04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
because really what this problem comes
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
down to is that this is is something is
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
ongoing care you know they're getting
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
you're getting 12 visits a year
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
so you know you're not going to a
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
podiatrist 12 times a year you're the
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
only other person i know you would do
 
04:12:55.600 --> 04:12:56.469 align:start position:0%
only other person i know you would do
use

04:12:56.469 --> 04:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
regular visits would be a physical
 
04:12:59.040 --> 04:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
regular visits would be a physical
therapist

04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
am i guessing correctly
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be the consequences that
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
physical therapists would come in and
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
want the same thing can i can i
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.680 --> 04:13:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
you have to understand that chiropractic
 
04:13:14.790 --> 04:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
care is not only
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
has a lot of health benefits but
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
it has and i could have brought a bunch
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
of studies regarding reduction of opioid
 
04:13:22.880 --> 04:13:24.149 align:start position:0%
of studies regarding reduction of opioid
use

04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
we are in a a pandemic with opioid abuse
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
right now i mean i've i've got a bill
 
04:13:32.469 --> 04:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
upstairs downstairs that i'm trying to
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
get past um but the issue is is the
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
reduction of costs of medicine
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
offsets what we're doing and we're doing
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
it naturally and we're getting people
 
04:13:45.040 --> 04:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
it naturally and we're getting people
well

04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not just about the manipulation
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's about a total lifestyle
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
change and
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think the health benefits just
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
outweigh the the negatives
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:14:05.910 --> 04:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
i think we really appreciate what you're
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
offering for services but i have to go
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
back to what the empirical evidence
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
showed us
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
and when
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
michael eaton hayton came from the
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
insurance department they did have
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
a cost-sharing parity study from 2014
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
that sunset in 2017.
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and what they said they said they found
 
04:14:29.670 --> 04:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
lower co-pays
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
did correspond with higher use of
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
it did not offset the costs it did not
 
04:14:38.479 --> 04:14:39.670 align:start position:0%
it did not offset the costs it did not
reduce

04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
04:14:51.510 --> 04:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
it did increase the total spending
 
04:14:51.520 --> 04:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
it did increase the total spending
overall

04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
without the without significant decrease
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
in opioid use
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
and she um he did have a link to the
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
reports that i don't know did we receive
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the link
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
i can't remember
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
but i think we have to i mean anecdotal
 
04:15:08.720 --> 04:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
but i think we have to i mean anecdotal
evidence

04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
is great and we understand that but i
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
think we still have to go back to what
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
the real cost will be
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
for insurance premiums
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
and if we reduce the the co-pays there
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
is likely to be an increase in premium
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
so representative can i ask a question
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely yeah
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
the study was done by whom i didn't i
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
didn't catch you this came from michael
 
04:15:33.990 --> 04:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
heaton at the insurance department tyler
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
can you help yeah so michelle was
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
filling in for me and talked about the
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
two studies we did the prior legislation
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
had us do a study
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much right after the bill passed
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
looking at data looking at people who
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
had lower cost sharing for chiropractic
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
services versus those who would hire and
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
then sort of looking at patterns among
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
the population so this is before the
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation had a chance to have an
 
04:15:55.040 --> 04:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
legislation had a chance to have an
impact

04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
then a couple of years later we looked
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
at the impact of the legislation again
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
to see whether there'd been a change
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
over time and in both cases you could
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
see increased use of the chiropractic
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
services um
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
the costs overall were higher but in
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
both of those studies it did there did
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
it appear to be a reduced use of opioids
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
in one of the studies at least it was um
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
it was not considered statistically
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
significant but that basically means
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
that you're 95 confidence not due to
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
sort of random variation so um i think
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the representation that it does
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
result in and it can cause that lower
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
use is probably likely although in any
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
of these studies coming up with sort of
 
04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
the causal association is always a
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of a question and and she did
 
04:16:40.710 --> 04:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
send us the link on
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
february the 3rd
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
i do have it in my email
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
along with 700 and somewhat other emails
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
that i haven't opened
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
um i can send you the links to the
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
report oh yeah i've got it here it is
 
04:16:53.110 --> 04:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative terry so i do
 
04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.920 --> 04:17:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:17:02.149 --> 04:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:03.910 --> 04:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
that goes to
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
related to cost
 
04:17:09.680 --> 04:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
related to cost
and

04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps ultimately availability
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
of coverage
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
we already identified that
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so so i do appreciate that uh by the
 
04:17:23.110 --> 04:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
same token
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
what i what i understand here is that
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
the same chiropractors want to be
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
treated in the same way under this bill
 
04:17:32.880 --> 04:17:33.910 align:start position:0%
treated in the same way under this bill
as

04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to the services provided
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh by a primary care physician or an
 
04:17:39.840 --> 04:17:41.910 align:start position:0%
uh by a primary care physician or an
osteopath

04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
osteopath
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure everybody here knows the
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
difference between an md and a do
 
04:17:46.720 --> 04:17:47.510 align:start position:0%
difference between an md and a do
so

04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
when i sustained an injury and went to
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
an md the md recommended that i go to a
 
04:17:52.239 --> 04:17:53.670 align:start position:0%
an md the md recommended that i go to a
do

04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:17:55.830 --> 04:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
the do did stuff that the do was trained
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
to do that the md was not trained to do
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
then the do recommended that i might
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
also see a chiropractor and the services
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
provided by the chiropractor were very
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
similar to those that were provided by
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
the uh by the d.o
 
04:18:10.000 --> 04:18:10.710 align:start position:0%
the uh by the d.o
now

04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
we already we already
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
provide a primary care apparently uh
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
co-pay and an osteopath co-pay that is
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh what should we call minimal
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the sake of this argument i think
 
04:18:27.429 --> 04:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
we all know what this means 15 or
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
whatever okay entry level co-pay
 
04:18:29.840 --> 04:18:31.030 align:start position:0%
whatever okay entry level co-pay
whatever

04:18:31.030 --> 04:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
so if in fact the services that are
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
provided by the chiropractor
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
are similar to those that are provided
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
by a do
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
one might ask why is a carve out given
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the to the do to be treated in the
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
same way as a pcp even though the pcp is
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
not qualified to provide these kinds of
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
services but not to the
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
to to the chiropractor and understanding
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
that there's been a historic
 
04:18:56.399 --> 04:18:57.429 align:start position:0%
that there's been a historic
tension

04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
tension
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the medical field between
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
those who have medical degrees
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
md or do and those who have pursued
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
careers in chiropractic i don't know how
 
04:19:11.110 --> 04:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
much mr truman i don't know how far down
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
we wanted to get into the weeds on this
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
but i think that what we need to hear
 
04:19:16.399 --> 04:19:17.349 align:start position:0%
but i think that what we need to hear
from

04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
the advocate of the bill here is that
 
04:19:23.110 --> 04:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
we need to receive a rationale
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
for why
 
04:19:24.479 --> 04:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
for why
providers

04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
chiropractors need to be treated in the
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
same way
 
04:19:31.189 --> 04:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
as does
 
04:19:35.110 --> 04:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps even more so than than mds
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
as an additional consideration to the
 
04:19:38.199 --> 04:19:39.910 align:start position:0%
as an additional consideration to the
ramifications

04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
financially that have already been
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out and discussed and we all
 
04:19:44.560 --> 04:19:46.149 align:start position:0%
pointed out and discussed and we all
acknowledge

04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledge
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
yeah to me it's the 12 visits
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's the monthly visit it's fine yeah
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
i've been i've been in business 45 years
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry yeah this nobody sees me
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
they just hear me it's like i'm on the
 
04:19:59.359 --> 04:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
they just hear me it's like i'm on the
radio

04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
radio
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
anyway i've been uh practiced 45 years
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
and my initial practice uh i i started
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
referring and getting referrals from
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeons
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
it has grown and grown in our profession
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
back in the old days yeah we were witch
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
doctors if you want to call it that
 
04:20:22.870 --> 04:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's no longer true i can't give you
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
the exact amount of schooling that we
 
04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
have compared to
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
a pcp but it's
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's pretty significant what we do
 
04:20:33.439 --> 04:20:35.349 align:start position:0%
it's pretty significant what we do
so

04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
what you had said i
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
i get a lot of referrals from from
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
medical doctors right now they don't
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
they don't i have yet to have somebody
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
refer to a do and have a d.o report
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
refer to me i'm a direct line to the
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
medical doctors
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
so i hope that
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
answers uh
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of follow up but isn't the
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
real reason why they're calling you a
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
specialist is because of the the amount
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
of visits that you could have on an
 
04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative i mr chair i have no clue
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
why they call us a specialist
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
but okay but just
 
04:21:10.560 --> 04:21:11.670 align:start position:0%
but okay but just
okay

04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
just to follow to clarify here by what i
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
meant when i was talking about i went
 
04:21:18.309 --> 04:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
from an md to a do to a chiropractor
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
just that was incidental that was my
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
particular situation okay um
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
we understand that
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
that chiropractors are viewed more
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
favorably by those in the medical
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
profession whether mds or does than they
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
were years ago i think that's generally
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
well known and understood
 
04:21:36.319 --> 04:21:38.309 align:start position:0%
well known and understood
i

04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
the servant we're looking at the
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
particular service that is provided by a
 
04:21:42.960 --> 04:21:44.469 align:start position:0%
particular service that is provided by a
chiropractor

04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
chiropractor
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
that could also be provided by a do
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent not not exactly the
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
same because they don't do manipulations
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
right but we're in the same we're in the
 
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
same ballpark if not in the same seating
 
04:21:56.720 --> 04:21:57.830 align:start position:0%
same ballpark if not in the same seating
section

04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:21:57.840 --> 04:21:58.710 align:start position:0%
section
so

04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:58.720 --> 04:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
so
so

04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
what what i'm asking is that that you
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
make the case that with respect to these
 
04:22:06.000 --> 04:22:07.670 align:start position:0%
make the case that with respect to these
particular

04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
injuries or issues
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
that you ought to be treated in the same
 
04:22:12.239 --> 04:22:13.269 align:start position:0%
that you ought to be treated in the same
way

04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to the co-payment
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
as do's and mds
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
that would be a level playing field and
 
04:22:21.670 --> 04:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we need
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
correct because
 
04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry whether it's 12 visits or 120
 
04:22:26.560 --> 04:22:27.670 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry whether it's 12 visits or 120
right

04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
i i look at an orthopedic surgeon as a
 
04:22:30.720 --> 04:22:32.389 align:start position:0%
i i look at an orthopedic surgeon as a
specialist

04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
04:22:32.399 --> 04:22:33.269 align:start position:0%
specialist
okay

04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
i don't look at a do as a specialist
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
i don't look at a medical doctor well
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's why i believe that so primary
 
04:22:43.110 --> 04:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
care physician and osteopath are
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
effectively lumped or named together
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
well it also could be a nurse
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
practitioner it's the third well yes
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
because they're all three years because
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
this is 2022 nurse practitioner in there
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
answering our questions
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh if i recall correctly you stated when
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
you when we first heard the bill
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
that you are actually a first phone call
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
that a person can make that they you
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to be referred to
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
correct so you are in effect already a
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
primary care provider
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
that you can refer someone to someone
 
04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
else if it's something that you are not
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
capable of providing but otherwise i can
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
call you directly book an appointment
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
so you are already a primary care
 
04:23:30.159 --> 04:23:32.389 align:start position:0%
so you are already a primary care
correct

04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay so let me articulate how i see this
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill at this moment and we can see where
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
we want to go here
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um historically uh us republicans have
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
said that we are opposed to health
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
insurance mandates
 
04:23:50.070 --> 04:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is technically a mandate
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
because we are mandating what the
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
compensation the premium you know the
 
04:23:56.710 --> 04:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
compensation for the physician so just
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
want you to know that you're you're
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
you're you're crossing that line that
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
people would say you know that you're
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be doing that okay
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
what's important here
 
04:24:05.760 --> 04:24:06.550 align:start position:0%
what's important here
is

04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
that the the the uh the game the role of
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
the dice that we're doing here is if we
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
were to pass this
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
theoretically now making it more
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
affordable for a person to uh go to to
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
do the chiropractic visits
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
therefore that increases utilization
 
04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
there'll be more people using it
 
04:24:29.110 --> 04:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know someone says well if i'm if i
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
if one thing if i'm ten bucks versus
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars you know um you know i'll
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
use something more so
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
the risk is excess utilization but we're
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
arguing is that's a good thing because
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
we'd much rather them do this than go to
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
that surgeon who uh want to cut you open
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
and cost hundreds of thousand dollars to
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
fix your back
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
and in that balance
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
the interesting twist to this is
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
is that now we're running
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
04:24:58.960 --> 04:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
the insurance
company

04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
is going to then decide whether they
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
want to continue to offer this benefit
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
so they're going to balance that off by
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
how important it is to people that they
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
get chiropractic coverage
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
versus how much decreases that
 
04:25:17.279 --> 04:25:18.950 align:start position:0%
versus how much decreases that
utilization

04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
utilization
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
the premium that that's being used and
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
then saying oh boy this is really going
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
to have an impact on premium so we're
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
better off just dropping it and let the
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
person just pay to the chiropractor let
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
me further muddy the waters mr chairman
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
um by
 
04:25:33.840 --> 04:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
um by
observing

04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
observing
 
04:25:37.110 --> 04:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
that what is being
 
04:25:38.790 --> 04:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
proposed here
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
in this legislation is in fact i believe
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
already taking place
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
within within the insurance industry
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to this particular
 
04:25:48.880 --> 04:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
with respect to this particular
profession

you must specialist is 30 yeah yeah
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
because i'm an advantage right
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
especially this is 30. you must have a
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
different plan than i do okay i'll have
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
to look into that yeah right this is the
 
04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
stride stride plan so we have harvard
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
pilgrim and whether i go to my pcp
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
or if i go to my chiropractor it's the
 
04:27:09.510 --> 04:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
same co-pay
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i have unlimited visits
 
04:27:13.520 --> 04:27:15.030 align:start position:0%
and i have unlimited visits
and

04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
let me tell you i go to my chiropractor
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
before i go to my pcp okay so you're
 
04:27:21.110 --> 04:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
making the argument that the law is fine
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance no but more insurance
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
companies should be doing this because i
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a benefit to the people
 
04:27:29.670 --> 04:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing it voluntarily without
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
having to be told that they have to do
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
it right but if we can yeah
 
04:27:34.560 --> 04:27:35.429 align:start position:0%
it right but if we can yeah
right

04:27:35.429 --> 04:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's reverend
 
04:27:40.229 --> 04:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
so is is a is a chiropractor deter uh
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
considered a specialist
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
by statute
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
or by the insurance companies insurance
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
company okay so one insurance company
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
can say you're a specialist one can say
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
or one could carve it out and treat you
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
something differently or or
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you're your own your own thing
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's cool
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
you do you right
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
what do you think john
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
i am a chiropractic patient
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
i believe uh
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
the representative knows who i go to
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
down in derry chiropractic
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i started going there many many years
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
ago before
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
medicare before i was on medicare and
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
now that i am on medicare it's been
 
04:28:27.439 --> 04:28:28.229 align:start position:0%
now that i am on medicare it's been
great

04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:28:30.309 --> 04:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
i have spinal stenosis
 
04:28:30.319 --> 04:28:31.429 align:start position:0%
i have spinal stenosis
and

04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
it helps me
 
04:28:32.880 --> 04:28:34.389 align:start position:0%
it helps me
immeasurably

04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
immeasurably
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to see him once a month
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
getting checked out and realigned and
 
04:28:43.110 --> 04:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
stretched and pulled and pushed and it
 
04:28:43.120 --> 04:28:44.389 align:start position:0%
stretched and pulled and pushed and it
works

04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
works
 
04:28:46.389 --> 04:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
because if it didn't i certainly
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here would you believe
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
yes i would okay
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right representative burrows
 
04:28:56.550 --> 04:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this has been alluded to but
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
when you were talking about the
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies weighing the cost
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
benefits you know i think we need to go
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
back to when chiropractors were
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
considered boogeymen and i think they
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
were maybe you'd agree that that they
 
04:29:10.469 --> 04:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
were being sent to surgeons
 
04:29:13.110 --> 04:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
um and and the astronomical costs that
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
that poses to insurance companies is is
 
04:29:17.189 --> 04:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
that true that they would normally have
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
gone to a surgeon rather tend to yes
 
04:29:19.279 --> 04:29:20.070 align:start position:0%
gone to a surgeon rather tend to yes
yeah

04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:29:20.080 --> 04:29:20.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

04:29:20.950 --> 04:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's important thank you
 
04:29:25.990 --> 04:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else want to
 
04:29:29.110 --> 04:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
comment yeah represent evan
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i too have been to chiropractors
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
over the years and i appreciate your
 
04:29:32.560 --> 04:29:34.630 align:start position:0%
over the years and i appreciate your
profession

04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
profession
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe it is true that uh going
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
to a chiropractor in some cases can
 
04:29:41.670 --> 04:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
reduce uh or eliminate the need to go to
 
04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
a surgeon right
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
and in the insurance companies
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
their desire to reduce costs for
 
04:29:51.750 --> 04:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
medical care and and provide lower
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
premiums they would factor that in i
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
believe in their business model
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
they would look at those
 
04:29:59.429 --> 04:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
you know maybe even do some in-depth
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
studying that we're not capable of doing
 
04:30:00.880 --> 04:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
studying that we're not capable of doing
here

04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
and factor that in so
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know my thought is
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
trust the insurance companies
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
to some degree into uh
 
04:30:11.600 --> 04:30:13.189 align:start position:0%
to some degree into uh
deciding

04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh how to incentivize people to go
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
either to a chiropractor or to a surgeon
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
because we know surgery is very
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
expensive right so it's
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh it's necessary sometimes but it can
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
be a lot more expensive than 12 visits
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
to a chiropractor
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're ready to vote do
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
anything yet today on this one so we'll
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
we'll bring this up again thanks for
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
your time yeah appreciate it yeah and
 
04:30:39.269 --> 04:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
and anything you take back from what you
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard discussion feel free to email us
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go to the speaker's
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
office right now
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
i told you you're right through the
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
calls over here
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:51.439 --> 04:30:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay so the situation with this panda is
 
04:31:04.800 --> 04:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
okay so the situation with this panda is
that

04:31:05.990 --> 04:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the wisdom of the legislature when we
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
pass this study to monitor
 
04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic code we sunsetted it
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
after five years
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
and so with this bill is to remove the
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
sunset so that we keep studying it or
 
04:31:22.880 --> 04:31:23.590 align:start position:0%
sunset so that we keep studying it or
keep

04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
keep
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative parker
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
i i think and i i i worked with becky on
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
this a little bit the sunset clause was
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
an end of 2024 we would stop providing
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
coverage for it not stop no there is no
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
no it's just the it's just the study
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
right you mean tyler might am i doing
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
this correctly
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
no the
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
requirement to cover
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
treatment including the ivig is what
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
would sunset
 
04:31:59.110 --> 04:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
that being said if it's deteriorative
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
sort of the
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
medical disagreement in the community
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
about what is considered medically
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
necessary shifts toward this is clearly
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
a condition it's clearly there's clearly
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
medically necessary treatment then we
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
would consider it discriminatory for an
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
insurance company not to cover it i
 
04:32:17.110 --> 04:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
think the sunset date was considered a
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
compromise because there's a lot of
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about how much it would cost
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
to increase coverage um in situations
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
that could be concerned about medical
 
04:32:27.189 --> 04:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
necessity treatment patterns everything
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
else because that led to the
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
conversations about how the insurance
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
department would collect data to look at
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the company
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
associated with it which proved to be
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
problematic using the claims data and
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis code
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
but i think wasn't it true that that we
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
because they weren't using a specific
 
04:32:46.870 --> 04:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
code we couldn't get the data
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we wanted we couldn't isolate what
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
the autoimmune deficiency was costing us
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
but we also didn't see an increase in
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
any other code that would indicate that
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
it was so expensive that premiums were
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
going to skyrocket which is why they
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
were afraid to approve this in the first
 
04:33:03.359 --> 04:33:04.390 align:start position:0%
were afraid to approve this in the first
place

04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that a lot of people
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
have benefited from having this coverage
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
and if we take it away from them
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are going to be hurt by
 
04:33:16.150 --> 04:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
that because this this is a very real
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
problem and thankfully we you know we
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
covering under insurance for the last
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
couple years if we take that away a lot
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
of people are going to be hurt by it and
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
i can't see that it's hurt the state or
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
impacted premiums or anything like that
 
04:33:30.240 --> 04:33:31.029 align:start position:0%
impacted premiums or anything like that
so

04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:33.990 --> 04:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think we have to be really clear here
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
you're seeing it is it is a mandate that
 
04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so your fear is if we let the thing
 
04:33:44.400 --> 04:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
and so your fear is if we let the thing
sunset

04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
then that mandate's gone and there'll be
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
somebody who would not get coverage
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's not what i heard from you you're
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying we don't even have a
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
diagnostic code for this so we don't
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
even know
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
if anybody's been diagnosed with it we
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
have a non-specific diagnosis code when
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
we looked at the claims data there were
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of adults that were coded with
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
that diagnosis code the overall numbers
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
seem to be relatively stable but sorting
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
out which patients are actually true
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
pandas is not something we would be able
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
to do using the claims data right so the
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
question is how do you know that that
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't get coverage
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
well i
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
i don't but if we repeal this then
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
what why would we repeal
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
you know we said that we were gonna they
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
weren't providing coverage
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
we told them we we created this mandate
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
that i remember the discussions yeah
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
so that we would we would they would
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
have coverage and not if we repeal
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
why would we want to repeal this because
 
04:34:49.830 --> 04:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
well i my memory was there was nobody
 
04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
who didn't get
 
04:34:51.920 --> 04:34:53.269 align:start position:0%
who didn't get
coverage

04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
the problem was
 
04:34:58.150 --> 04:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
that there was no diagnosis
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's why passing the mandate
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
seemed so questionable to me
 
04:35:04.150 --> 04:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
because because we didn't we didn't even
 
04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
know whether anybody's actually being
 
04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosed no i think the concern was
 
04:35:10.390 --> 04:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
that there was a a particular type of
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
therapy for this that right there was a
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
particular therapy that's at harvard and
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
harvard was adamantly opposed to that
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
therapy it was a blood thing and there
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
were people who said that that that was
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
not a good course of action and there
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
were doctors who testified that yes
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
it was and it had provided relief for
 
04:35:28.561 --> 04:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
it was and it had provided relief for
people

04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
and that was the big
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
question that we had before we passed it
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
but we did
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
no i understand i think you guys were in
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
the majority at the time and i was in
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
the minority
 
04:35:41.520 --> 04:35:42.390 align:start position:0%
the minority
now

04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
can the insurance companies not
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
reimburse people for their treatment for
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
so if the if the mandate did sunset an
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
insurance company could potentially say
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay the treatment is not medically
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
necessary the
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
patient the member would have the
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
ability to go through an appeals process
 
04:36:08.709 --> 04:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
which could go to an external set of
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
clinicians i know that one i wrote that
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
law right and those clinicians could
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
also agree with the insurer that yes
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is a there's a lack of clarity and
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's not obvious that this is medically
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
necessary treatment in which case the
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
insurance company would be on pretty
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
solid ground they could also say yes it
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely there's been enough
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
development with this disease
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
identifying it clarifying that ivig
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
treatment is appropriate in which case
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
the insurance company would have to
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
cover it
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
but do we want to take that might do we
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
want to take that risk and why would we
 
04:36:42.789 --> 04:36:42.799 align:start position:0%
get representative bartlett
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm just wondering if
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
we could call um paula rogers up she was
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
very involved in this um in these
 
04:36:49.199 --> 04:36:50.390 align:start position:0%
very involved in this um in these
discussions

04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
04:36:50.400 --> 04:36:51.429 align:start position:0%
discussions
um

04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay come on up paul this um
 
04:36:53.920 --> 04:36:55.029 align:start position:0%
okay come on up paul this um
expensive

04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
treatment and um how anthem would look
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
at it right if this were um so what what
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
happened to this mysterious treatment
 
04:37:04.869 --> 04:37:04.879 align:start position:0%
that harvard didn't like so so i think
 
04:37:07.830 --> 04:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at the biologically based
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
chapter biologically they pull the mic a
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
the um if you look at the chapter i
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
think it reads something along the line
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
of pandas
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
is tagged on after
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
autism perhaps
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
number of mental conditions behavioral
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
conditions that are formally recognized
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
and then there's the little tag of
 
04:37:35.990 --> 04:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
immunoglobulin therapy
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct tyler you're looking at
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
so i think what you're trying to get at
 
04:37:42.349 --> 04:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
is we might want to get rid of
 
04:37:45.510 --> 04:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
immunoglobulin therapy but pandas needs
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
to be covered
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
and pandas is covered so the problem is
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
i suspect there are a lot of people um i
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
think i would reference the fact that
 
04:37:58.070 --> 04:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
the american academy of pediatrics has
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
recognized pandas where the dispute
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
comes is how to treat it
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
and so you know there are a number of
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
indicators that a child may have
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
a pandas or pandas-like condition
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
and the typical treatment would be
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
antibiotics a steroid maybe some
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral health assistance maybe some
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
family counseling to deal with the
 
04:38:24.629 --> 04:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
behavioral aspects of the disease
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
the real
 
04:38:27.310 --> 04:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
question last time around was this
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
immunoglobulin therapy
 
04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i can understand why you feel well if
 
04:38:32.000 --> 04:38:32.709 align:start position:0%
so i can understand why you feel well if
you

04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
rub out the entire language pandas is
 
04:38:36.789 --> 04:38:36.799 align:start position:0%
somehow evaporated
 
04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
so maybe there's a middle ground and i
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
anthem's not taking a position on this i
 
04:38:42.789 --> 04:38:42.799 align:start position:0%
can assure you
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
um we've had no complaints about our
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
inadequacy about treating
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
or request work or responding to
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
physician interests and treatments
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
the follow-up could could you also be
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to confirm that there's not been a
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
a spike in um claims
 
04:39:02.080 --> 04:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
a spike in um claims
costs

04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
when this this expensive treatment is
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
covered it's not a common condition so
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
the the expenses would be there
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
over the course of the child's
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
experience with this condition
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
and maybe some therapies you getting up
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
toward the immunoglobulin ivig and
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
aphresis with the expensive treatments
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're providing those
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
specifically or have that we're
 
04:39:30.320 --> 04:39:31.629 align:start position:0%
specifically or have that we're
providing

04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
providing
 
04:39:31.639 --> 04:39:33.189 align:start position:0%
providing
immunoglobulin

04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
immunoglobulin
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
and tyler's looked and he will see the
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
use of that but the problem is you can't
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
trace it back to a diagnosis where you
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
can say this is pandas it could be any
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
number of things
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
complexity of it
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
so you could look at that language and
 
04:39:48.080 --> 04:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
so you could look at that language and
say

04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
maybe immunoglobulin is not really
 
04:39:51.040 --> 04:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
maybe immunoglobulin is not really
necessary

04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
but the pandas seems to be in some
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
quarters something that they would like
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.080 --> 04:40:00.868 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:40:00.878 --> 04:40:06.390 align:start position:0%
yes
sure

04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
so i'll try to give perhaps a family's
 
04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
perspective on this so it is really two
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
different issues and pandas is uh
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
something and i think if you ask most
 
04:40:17.360 --> 04:40:18.628 align:start position:0%
something and i think if you ask most
families

04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
their number one stressor is actually
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
getting proper coverage which is it is a
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
battle with the insurance company
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
particularly once the condition reaches
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
the level of needing ivig so some fairly
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
new data that
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
i picked up from a consortium of people
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
out of california of
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
caregivers around pandas
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
only about 10 percent of the most
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
chronic cases require ivig and actually
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
the treatment prior to reaching that
 
04:40:47.280 --> 04:40:48.310 align:start position:0%
the treatment prior to reaching that
level

04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
is antibiotics are things that are quite
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
affordable and usually covered within
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
policies the problem is as soon as
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
your child or even adults now reach that
 
04:40:58.160 --> 04:40:59.030 align:start position:0%
your child or even adults now reach that
level

04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
ivig the cost escalates significantly to
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
the point that
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
i can say for our daughter when she died
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
just prior to starting those treatments
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at a 32 000 out of
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
pocket expense
 
04:41:12.878 --> 04:41:14.070 align:start position:0%
pocket expense
and

04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
all the research that's happened since
 
04:41:17.120 --> 04:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
all the research that's happened since
um

04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:20.708 --> 04:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
has really progressed towards ivy being
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
a very effective treatment for a chronic
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
case of autoimmune and it's not just
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
pandas there's other autoimmune
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
conditions that are currently using ivig
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
effectively as well
 
04:41:30.480 --> 04:41:31.430 align:start position:0%
effectively as well
so

04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
really what we're looking at is two
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
things one is that we're sort of at that
 
04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
awkward period and i would say a
 
04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
parallels or long-term covet we all kind
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
of feel it's there that is something
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
there but how are we going to put a
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
number to that or be able to quantify
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
that when we still
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
don't have a great diagnostic tool for
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
it so it's still somewhat of a clinical
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of whether
 
04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
you need ivig or not and i can tell you
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
that most physicians are quite reluctant
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
to recommend it
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
unless they feel it's absolutely
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
critical because actually
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
most of the patients they see
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
not all of them would be covered under
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statute
 
04:42:13.600 --> 04:42:14.628 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statute
because

04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
they're being covered by out-of-state
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
or or self-insured plans and it's not
 
04:42:22.948 --> 04:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
unusual to hear them going through
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
three levels of appeals and then
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
be declined and actually the
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
the physicians that are having to do
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
this are spending an inorder amount of
 
04:42:31.040 --> 04:42:32.310 align:start position:0%
this are spending an inorder amount of
time

04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
just fighting to get coverage and to get
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and even if they're
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
successful it offer it's awful usually
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's through a very long succession of
 
04:42:44.550 --> 04:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
appeal processes so the two components
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
are important and really what i think
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
we're asking is that
 
04:42:50.230 --> 04:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're sort of at that stage where
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a fair amount of research coming
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
down the pike octa pharma is in a stage
 
04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
3 clinical trial today but the results
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
probably won't be
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
available for
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know to the public for two to three
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
years minimum
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
so it's really giving a little bit more
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
time for the research to present itself
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
we now have a diagnostic the icd code
 
04:43:11.520 --> 04:43:15.190 align:start position:0%
we now have a diagnostic the icd code
89.89

04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
which is sort of a non-specific but does
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
indicate pandas as a diagnosis
 
04:43:20.718 --> 04:43:21.390 align:start position:0%
indicate pandas as a diagnosis
in

04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
icd-2023 i believe pandas will have its
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
own diagnostic code
 
04:43:29.350 --> 04:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
so there is progress towards actually
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
being able to make the data easier to
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
find and easier to report against and
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
really all we're asking is
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time if if the repeal
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the sunset is
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
sunset is not possible
 
04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
an extension such that some of these
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
trials that are underway would actually
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
generate some data in the meantime
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
the impact to that 10 percent of the
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
families that need it could be
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
and typically once you reach that level
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh a child is unable to go to school if
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to school there's a
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other factors they
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't get daycare
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
the the the condition is such that the
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
ig is a
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
basically a life changer for for the kid
 
04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
and also for the family frankly it has
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
to bear that burden
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
so i think we're really really asking
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
for is just a little bit more time in
 
04:44:24.070 --> 04:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
the meantime
 
04:44:26.070 --> 04:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
families in new hampshire are benefiting
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
from it
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
but there's also many families in new
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire that aren't
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
covered by the bill because they have
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
out of state insurance that are
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
and what i would suggest is that if you
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to study this more
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
since this bill was passed dartmouth has
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
become has opened up a pandas clinic
 
04:44:44.878 --> 04:44:46.150 align:start position:0%
become has opened up a pandas clinic
officially

04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
officially
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i've asked them to start collecting
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
data on
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
what they're doing which is you know
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
better than nothing
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
but i think that could be a source for
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
us also to have an ongoing discussion
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
about that it certainly is a compromise
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative fargo um
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
so so by the passage of the original
 
04:45:04.798 --> 04:45:06.230 align:start position:0%
so so by the passage of the original
bill

04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
it has helped families in new hampshire
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
and continues to do that
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
right so those
 
04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
exactly so those families that live in
 
04:45:17.430 --> 04:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and are covered by a plan
 
04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
that is registered in the state to do
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
business estate have benefited from the
 
04:45:20.958 --> 04:45:21.910 align:start position:0%
business estate have benefited from the
plan

04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
and and anthem i think has said they're
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
neutral which would suggest that it's
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
tolerable to them i think the other
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have also not
 
04:45:33.510 --> 04:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
been very vocal about saying that this
 
04:45:33.520 --> 04:45:34.310 align:start position:0%
been very vocal about saying that this
is

04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:45:34.320 --> 04:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
is
a

04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
a detrimental bill to to their ability
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
to to support it
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
so i guess my position is why would we
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
want to sunset this if it's working and
 
04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's not hurting anyone or costing
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's not impacting premiums it's not
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
well how do you know it's not impacting
 
04:45:53.760 --> 04:45:55.110 align:start position:0%
well how do you know it's not impacting
premiums

04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
i just asked tyler if he saw any
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
any effect from it
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
that would affect premiums in any way
 
04:46:05.430 --> 04:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
and he said he can't even identify
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
where it is because
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
right so how do you know how if we don't
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
get identified how do you how do you
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
predict premium how do you predict
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
utilization just simply if on something
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
that's so intangible as this
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative bartlett well
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um do keep track of
 
04:46:25.270 --> 04:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
large claims the underwriters are
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
flagged when they see um something
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
coming in and the insurance and they
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
will use that in their rate making
 
04:46:32.000 --> 04:46:33.110 align:start position:0%
will use that in their rate making
process

04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
so that if
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
the insurance department is not
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
made aware that there are some big
 
04:46:39.200 --> 04:46:40.230 align:start position:0%
made aware that there are some big
spikes

04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
spikes
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
regarding a treatment like this i would
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
think that that would be fairly
 
04:46:46.948 --> 04:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
good evidence that it's not
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
directly affecting premium
 
04:46:48.718 --> 04:46:49.590 align:start position:0%
directly affecting premium
okay

04:46:49.590 --> 04:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative emma did you have
 
04:46:50.878 --> 04:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
representative emma did you have
something

04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah just looking the repeal doesn't
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
happen until july 1 2024 so there's two
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
more uh there's a whole other
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
legislative term there's two years to do
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
something even if we don't do anything
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
today right so
 
04:47:06.070 --> 04:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
but you said maybe more time would uh
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
give us some more data
 
04:47:08.160 --> 04:47:09.270 align:start position:0%
give us some more data
um

04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
but even if we do nothing
 
04:47:13.110 --> 04:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's importance but not
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily urgency at this point to do
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
anything because the sun sets oh yeah i
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
was thinking i thought the sunset was
 
04:47:20.550 --> 04:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
now yeah
 
04:47:20.560 --> 04:47:21.590 align:start position:0%
now yeah
okay

04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:21.600 --> 04:47:23.110 align:start position:0%
okay
so

04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so all right well we'll we'll
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
talk let's talk about this some more
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
we'll have to take this up now
 
04:47:30.798 --> 04:47:33.430 align:start position:0%
we'll have to take this up now
okay

04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.840 --> 04:47:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
all right uh relative to pharmacy
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
