sorry about that thank you for the uh
 
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
few moments to talk and I won't take up
 
00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
too much of your time but this I want to
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
present this bill um for multiple
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
reasons but anyways I wanted the general
 
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
court to make a decision on it and move
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
forward and it's it really is about our
 
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 align:start position:0%
our children and our kids
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
education the
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh the video that I actually sent the
 
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
entire committee last night would be the
 
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
videos that would be used uh in class
 
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
and these videos are uh educational
 
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
medically accurate comprehensive and age
 
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate our schools are not
 
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
providing our kids this information
 
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
which is uh important in making
 
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
decisions it is also important that our
 
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
kids have an accurate knowledge of for
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
the healthy relationship and a strong
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
society and here's a here's one fact
 
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
just so we know this is I think it's
 
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
necessary that they start learning this
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
it is estimated that 33% of uh women
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
between uh teenage years and also
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
45 uh will get an abortion
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
33% and out of those there it's
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
estimated 18% will be teenages and out
 
00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
of out of that part uh and for 58% will
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
be in the 20s so this information is
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
necessary now and not later in their
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
life and I believe that this information
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
is information our kids really need to
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
know and understand what they're getting
 
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
into and how it may affect them our
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
school health uh class teacher instructs
 
00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
our kids on many things including
 
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
abortion today and we should not allow
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
our kids to be ignorant or confused to
 
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
what takes place during the different
 
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
abortions I can tell you in my district
 
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
they have a full SC schule I think it
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
goes for about 8 weeks and I mean it is
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
full I said I I I never had anything
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
like that when I was growing up and I'm
 
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
saying these kids are learning a lot but
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
occasionally we have snow days
 
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
assemblies and other things that will
 
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 align:start position:0%
distract from the class and therefore
 
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
one of the topics would be missed and I
 
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
would not want to see this topic to be
 
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
missed uh some may say that uh this
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
video or the videos here are to
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
graphic but I say we have many
 
00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 align:start position:0%
questionable teaching and non-teaching
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
materials in our schools
 
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
today so you you you know is it too
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
graphic is not that's I guess you could
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
question it but I don't think it is
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
these are comprehensive completely
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
educational well done nonpolitical
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
non-religious V uh
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
videos I think both sides should be able
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
to get behind this and actually move it
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
forward Banning these Banning these
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
educational videos would be no than
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
Banning books and not allowing the
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
children to
 
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
learn there is nothing to hide really
 
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
nothing to
 
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
hide they're non-political and
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
non-religious I I hope that you would uh
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
ought to pass this bill 667 I I'm not
 
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
sure of the number now I apologize but I
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
hope you ought to pass this bill and I
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate I'll take any questions and
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
answer on the best I can uh thank you
 
00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative questions from the
 
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.230 align:start position:0%
representative questions from the
committee

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
question um I might understand that this
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
is taking away local control for
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum local control for curriculum
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
materials yeah I that's my question uh
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you could
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
look at it that way yes I look at it is
 
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
there are some things in life that need
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
to be consistent throughout our state
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
and this is one one thing I can see that
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier in our district
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
different distractions that go on or
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
snow days or something else we don't
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
want to miss this topic and so that's
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing it to the general court
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
so it's actually consistent throughout
 
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.309 align:start position:0%
so it's actually consistent throughout
the

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
state thank you yes represent Cornell
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
could you get into more detail about the
 
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general shall have standing and
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
have a cause of action to sue for
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
damages or relief on behalf when what
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
would cause that to
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
happen uh um could you repeat the
 
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
question I
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
apologize I I I'm want to know what the
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General shall have standing as
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
parents Patria to enforce this section
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
on behalf of any or all res any are all
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
residents or citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General shall have a
 
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
cause of action to Su for damages or
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
injunctive relief on behalf of any or
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
all residents or citizens of New
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire against any person or entity
 
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
that violates this section so I'm seeing
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
that as the Attorney General on behalf
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
of my neighbor down the street who
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any children in the school
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
could bring suit against the Attorney
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
General would have to bring suit against
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
the school for that well yeah thank you
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
for the question and and again we we
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
have a lot of ifs there you know if you
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
know if you know it's it's possible if
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's possible to do this or if it's
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
possible to do that we don't know for
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
sure I mean
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
what you're saying could be true I don't
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
know at this point but I know that this
 
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
video a video set of videos were really
 
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
important that I think the it's more for
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
the school district to follow the law if
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
it goes into law that's what it's about
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
follow followup yes so you're saying
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
that if the school district doesn't show
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
this for whatever reason someone who
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a child in the school can
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
complain to the attorney General and Sue
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
the school for not showing
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
it uh again thank you for the question
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
the I would I would say yes you're
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
probably right all right but I'm not an
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
attorney so I don't know all right and I
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
think it would be no different than us
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
all of us paying taxes to our schools a
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
lot of us don't have children in
 
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
school thank
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
you further questions yes representative
 
00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
you further questions yes representative

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
Freeman
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
representative CIS for coming before us
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
so um I wanted to know if you know that
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
does the state require that we have
 
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
education in all of our school
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
districts have what help does the state
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
require that we have health education in
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
all of our districts yes it does so and
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
may may I have a followup sure thank you
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
so there is no local control when it
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
comes to health education that was an
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
edict handed down by the state is that
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
correct that is that's my understanding
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
Accord going into the law right now
 
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.190 align:start position:0%
Accord going into the law right now
thank

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman Cordell
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
um repres thank you for bringing this is
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
it your belief that the health care
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
providers that young women go to
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
seea uh fail to provide appropriate uh
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
advisement on their
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
options yeah thank you for the question
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
so interesting enough when I was just
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
doing an internet search which I know
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
everybody believes the internet is true
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
right um I was I actually landed on
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
plant Parenthood and all they showed or
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
all they provided in any video that I
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
could find out there was in clinic
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's all they talked about in clinic
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
all right as far as they didn't actually
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
dis they didn't actually explain the
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
different types of abortions or what
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
takes place during those so
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it's not my belief
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying the it's not widely
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
known out there what actually takes
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
place follow up Mr chair yes well I'm
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
not talking about Planned Parenthood or
 
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
any other organization I'm talking about
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
when the young woman or woman a woman or
 
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
a family go to meet with their health
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
care provider the doctor is going to be
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
working with them through any process of
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
decision- making is it your belief that
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
those people don't advise them of what
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
their options are uh again thanks for
 
00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
the question and of course I'm not there
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
with them so I don't know what they say
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
I really can't answer that just one more
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
followup CH thank you um and of all the
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
educational and I say this having been a
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
health teacher of all the educational
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities out there for youngsters
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
to see in schools to select how that you
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
selected this specific piece of the
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
video which are which are inflammatory
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
by the way what what they may be
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
accurate but they're inflammatory but
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
how did you happen to pick that specific
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
piece of the video to be seen uh your
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
expertise there again I you have to
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
start somewhere so I picked those to
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
start off with are there others that
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
could be just as good sure absolutely
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not saying they can't be
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
used either these are short animated
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
Well Done by
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
OBGYN doctors that have actually
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
performed abortions and stuff in the
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
past and they're actually doing the
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
narrating along with the anim animation
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
so they really done videos really done
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
very well and at this point here I don't
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
mind if you go with another one I mean I
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
can tell you that in my district the
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
healthc Care teacher uses a a video
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's about 40 50 years old it's you
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
know it's very well done and it explains
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
some of decision making that the kids go
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
through but that's them and then the
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
other thing is they actually use a TED
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
Talk when in the Ted Talk part it
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
actually goes in and actually actually
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
you can say it it touches on religion
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
even and in our case so they're using
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
other videos now to their advantage so
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
this video another video something
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
similar I'm not opposed to that thank
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
you thank here thank you representative
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
s thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm way over here on the
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
side on the other side of your speaker
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
so um I am trying to understand the
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
motivation behind the bill I I
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
understand that in our health classes we
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're providing
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
students with accurate information about
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
what happens with their bodies about
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
what happens uh if they choose to be
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
intimate or if they are forced to be
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
intimate with someone and uh the
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
different implications of that but what
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
I am really struggling to find is the
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
why this has any necess
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
if our schools are already providing
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
health information and providing
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
accurate information to students why we
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be showing videos about specific
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
medical procedure are we also going to
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
show them about or arthoscopic surgery
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
which most of our high school students
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
or many of our high school students will
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
experience are we also going to show
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
about setting broken bones why do we
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
need specific videos and by a particular
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
company on this one I I don't I don't
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
get it again thank you for the question
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
and again a specific company with was
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
not on my mind I started someplace I use
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
these videos to start we could use other
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
videos I'm not against that that's not
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
what the it's about it's about they are
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
teaching and touching on abortion in
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
health class but that's all they do they
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
touch on it and right in 33% as I just
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
stated before 33% of young women are
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to get an abortion so this is
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
going to affect a lot of people and they
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
so they should know what it takes place
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the different types of procedures
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
may may I just clarify when you talk
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
about 33% and I don't know where you get
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
that information from is that um
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
including people who have ectopic
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancies who have uh fetal
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
abnormalities who have all sorts of
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
complications or maybe uh other causes
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
that are are because it is absolutely
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
100% medically necessary for them to
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
have a procedure like that including um
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
miscarriages that fail among other
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
things yeah thank you for the question
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
again and I can gladly uh share the link
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
with you um after the meeting once I get
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
back to my computer where I got the 33%
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
from it did not break it out by the
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
different procedures or or necess needs
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
that point um I have a question um in
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 Lines 14 and 15 uh talks about
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
grades 9 through 12 um they have to show
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
uh annually at least two two of these
 
00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
uh annually at least two two of these
three

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
videos is that at each
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
grade they have to show two of
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
those uh videos so that um uh grades 9
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
10 11 and 12 they would see two of those
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
videos each
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
year yeah uh thanks for the question
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
after I put the bill together I actually
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
was talking to the healthc Care teacher
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
in my district again and I understand
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
that there's only certain grades that'll
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually go through health class and at
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
that point the intent was that all four
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
grades 9 10th 11th and 12th would have
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
this every year that was the intent on
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
the bill now I understand that if
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
they're only required to have health
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
class once in those four years I would
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
expect that we could even amend this to
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
make sense that this is shown at least
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
once in those four years and of course
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
and just so it's already on file parents
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
are able to opt out that's not
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
changed thank you resident
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
again representative sellers
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
so this bill is not meant to sway or
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
influence young women in any way shape
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
or manner on whether to get an abortion
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
or not is that
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
correct no it's not it's it's non-biased
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
like that it's only informational and it
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't carry Republican Democrat
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
Christian non-Christian it's not it's
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
just plain informational thank
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Woodcock and my
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
final question Mr chair yes um I'm
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
trying to think as a high school
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
teacher what piece of information we we
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
or video or book we repeat four years in
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
a row if we aren't trying to make a a
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
prejudicial statement I would suggest
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
you if you're going to run a video
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
requirement like that for 4 in a row
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps you should also do contraception
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
prevention four years in a row I wonder
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
why that was not part of your
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill um thanks for the
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't have an answer for
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
you it could it usually been I just
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
represent Bon thank you Mr chair and
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um are
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
you aware of in our any uh health and
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
wellness program in this state of uh
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
such a specific requirement um of
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
showing videos uh to illustrate any part
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum I apologize I am hard at
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'm sorry um I'm just
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if in your uh research um
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
talking to health and wellness teachers
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the state if you know of
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
any requirement in health and wellness
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
classes that even requires showing
 
00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:00.149 align:start position:0%
classes that even requires showing
videos

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
videos
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh thanks again for the question if
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
there's there's no requirement that I'm
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
aware of that says it has to be video
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
and material or any that whatever the
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
format wants to be it's up to the
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
teacher and even the style of the
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
teacher how she or he wants to teach is
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
totally up to
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
them follow
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
up um follow up just uh but but by doing
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
this you're taking away that ability for
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
the teacher to teach the curriculum in
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
the way that the teacher sees best fit
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
students what you say pardon
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
me no if anything I'm hoping adding that
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
to the teachers say because some
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
teachers don't use videos at all so I am
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
asking if they would use this video all
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
right and of course there would be
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and material I would think
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
that would go along with
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
this represent Hall Mr chair and thank
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I just want
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand you said the
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
you I watch these videos and you feel
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
that they are age appropriate I taught
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
middle school for 40 years I can't
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
imagine those eighth graders being ready
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
to go in and watch these videos that
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
were pretty graphic it I so my question
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
is you you stand by your words and
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
saying that they all these videos are
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
age appropriate yeah thanks for the
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
question these are not for eighth
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
graders it it says clearly 9 through 12
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
follow up yes I agree with that but I'm
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
just saying when those eighth graders
 
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
leave they're ready to go into in a
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
couple months to be in nth grade so that
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
was all that you feel at their age
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate yes I do okay thank
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
very much representative thank you uh

China a lot of that comes
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
because the women get
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
for a number of
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
years around the

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
information but laws like ultrasound
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
laws um requiring the showing
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the results of an ultrasound save
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
baby's lives at the rate of around
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
70% 70% of the women who see those
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
videos change their
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
minds about
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
abortion that's an awful lot of women an
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
awful lot of babies that would be
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
saved the fact is that they people in
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
our country do not
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
know what an abortion
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
is they do not understand that the sole
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of an abortion is to
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
kill a human a living human who has done
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
nothing but be
 
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.310 align:start position:0%
nothing but be
conceived

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
conceived
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
Destiny it's an
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
atrocity and educating women on what is
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
involved when when I go to the
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
hospital for an heart surgery
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
the doctor explains to me what they're
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
do they're going to stick stuff up my
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
veins they're going to burn parts of my
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
heart whatever they're going to
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
do when a women go for abortion this
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
all when we talk about these things and
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
when I say we I even mean the medical
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
providers they're very precise about
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
what they talk about so if we're talking
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
about an operation that's going to kill
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
a child inside the woman they don't talk
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
child they talk about the woman and what
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
the effects will be on
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
don't they don't tell the whole
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
truth I'm not saying they
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
lie I'm saying they don't tell the whole
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
truth because there's little to no
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of the long-term negative
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
consequences for the mother now that's
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
not part of this bill it's just because
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here talking about this I it this
 
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
always comes out
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
right if women
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
knew what was going to happen when they
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
went for an abortion very many were them
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
would not they don't and the reason they
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't is because it's not covered
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere and even medical providers
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
don't really talk about it in detail
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
occur and it's
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
a we're not for you could tie that back
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the bill so this is why we need this
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
education in the high schools because
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
women need to know what those operations
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
are they need to see
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
what actually happens they need to see
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
the babies trying to get away they need
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
to see the
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
results that's why we need it when they
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
see it they'll never forget it ever and
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
it'll save a lot of babies lives and a
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
lot of mothers a lot of
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
grief thank you very much questions from
 
00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:49.630 align:start position:0%
grief thank you very much questions from
the

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
committee see n thank you very much for
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
being back in
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
I have my written testimony here okay
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
fine uh good afternoon my name is Walter
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
the procedures that are involved in
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
abortion are not for the faint of heart
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's true given that it is estimated
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
that one in four women have had
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
abortions the topic can be extremely
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
triggering and therefore demands that we
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
treat it with the love and concern for
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
the students present giving them clear
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
Alternatives but nothing can change the
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
scientific fact that the goal of
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
abortion is is a dead
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
baby speaking strictly
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
scientifically chemical abortions use
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
two drugs on day one myth prone is used
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
to block the progesterone needed to
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
sustain the beginning of pregnancy if if
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
I could just um ask you uh to stick to
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
the bill itself not get into the uh
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
General topic of abortion yeah I
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
understand thank you young women also
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
need to know the truth about about how
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
abortion affects their bodies including
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
risk of bleeding and hemorrhaging
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
increased risk of uterine and breast
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
cancer and the possibility of sterility
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
or even death as is usually the case for
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
all major
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries many high schoolers and
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
college students who are pregnant before
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
they feel ready believe that abortion is
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
the only way out however the truth is
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
that there are many Pregnancy Resource
 
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
Centers in the state and that these
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
young women need to be informed about
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
life-saving options they offered to
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
support women from pregnancy through the
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
early years of Parenthood as well as the
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
option of
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
adoption members of my generation need
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
the truth to be able to make informed
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
decisions about our bodies and those of
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
our children I would minimally ask for
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
us to be given the education to make
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we know what our choices will
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
do to ourselves and to others
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
this is necessary to be responsible
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%

without
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
consequences today's public school
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
health curriculum was constructed by an
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
Advisory board on which Planned
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and Affiliates take several
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
seats they believe that young children
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
need to explore their sexuality that for
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
minors experimenting with sex is natural
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
that concept contraception is safe and
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
effective and that abortion is a way to
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
achieve your dream
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
dreams that's not how it played out for
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
many of the young women I knew in high
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
school and college who conceived too
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
soon out of five only one had her baby
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
the others chose abortion and have
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
struggled with mental illness drug abuse
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
and cancer another lost two wanted
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
children to the fact that she had been
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
on the pill no one told her that her
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
body would need time to heal before it
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
could sustain a pregnancy
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
again as a trustee of New Hampshire
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
right to life since
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
2013 I have encountered many more women
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
who feel betrayed by the education that
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
they received and who suffer greatly
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
from their decision to abort some write
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
plays create art and travel to schools
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
and churches telling their story some
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
work in Pregnancy Care Centers to help
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant women in crisis to get the
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
medical care family counseling and
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
financial help that they need some pray
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
outside of abortion facilities offering
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
help to both moms and their
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
babies some come to the March for Life
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
as quiet witnesses to the scars of
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
abortion I've met traumatized health
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
workers who were required to participate
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
in abortions who wanted to save lives
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
not take them I've met women who wanted
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
children but in their youth were told
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
that iuds were a safe method of
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
preventing pregnancy and discovered they
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
were sterile when they had them removed
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
I've known women who were trafficked
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
only to be betrayed Again by Planned
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
Parenthood who destroyed the
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
evidence abortion Advocates failed to
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
mention that their babies would be
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
dumped at the conquered landfill the
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
contraceptives can be abor atient or
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
told them that they could just go on
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
with their lives like nothing happened
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
after they chose to end their child's
 
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
after they chose to end their child's
life

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
wrap this P Bill all feel betrayed by A
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
system that told them that their choice
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
would not matter this includes the
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
educational system these children these
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
women were telling their stories and we
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
have a duty to
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
listen we owe the Next Generation better
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
than we received keeping our youth
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
compassion minimal they have a right to
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
know the truth about abortive patient
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
drugs surg surgical procedures their
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
very real risks and the aftermath of
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
abortion we owe it to them to tell them
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
the truth that their choices will have
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
lasting consequences no matter what they
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
choose but they need to know that
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
self-control never hurt anyone that
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
self-sacrifice for the good of others is
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
real love and that they can achieve
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
happiness even with a child in toe
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
please support HB 662 to ensure the next
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
generation gets the truth about
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
abortion thank you very much any
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee see none
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
much and I believe that is the last card
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
if there's no one else who wishes to
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
testify I think we have uh one more late
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
my apologies Mr chair for U no problem
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
being a late entry I thought there were
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
a stack of cards so uh Jerry FW the
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
associate executive director of the n
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association I'm
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
here today to raise several questions
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
legislation first um and I I was the
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
first three bills of the day are
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
speaking about health education and I I
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
will speak you the aggravation of
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
listening to me three times and try to
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
consolidate into this one testimony our
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
concerns of of those bills so thank you
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity this is a very prescribed
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum um eroding local control
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
decisions on what is best for local
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
communities and um the prime sponsor in
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
his testimony even indicated perhaps
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
that there were additional or different
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
Avenues to achieve the same purpose so I
 
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.269 align:start position:0%
Avenues to achieve the same purpose so I
would

00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
um I would just remind the committee of
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that perhaps the the one video
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
cited isn't the only way to achieve the
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
legislation some members um to
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman's question about
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
health education standards yes the
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
health education standards are included
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
and in fact were most recently invi uh
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
revised uh by the State Board of
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
Education uh I do believe that none of
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
the three topics that are listed in
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
today's uh first three bills uh abortion
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
adoption or gestation are part of the
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
new standards for health education uh in
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
the they call the 306s the 306 rules I
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
don't believe any of those topics are
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
addressed in the curriculum standards
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
that have been recently approved by the
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
Education some of the members of
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
this body have legislation uh around
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
what constitutes an adequate
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
education health education has been
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
eliminated from some of those proposed
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
definitions of what constitutes an
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
adequate education what happens to this
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
bill should that bill pass and health
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
education is not required as part of an
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education in the
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
definition this committee
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
a few days ago approved uh as ought to
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
instruction I would
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
invite committee members to explore the
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
proposed videos of that uh have been
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
provided to you uh by the prime sponsor
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
to explore and confirm what
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
evidence-based instruction has been
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
included in the production of those
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
videos to representative Hall's point I
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
was a middle school administrator for 15
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
years the legislation calls for
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
college I challenge each of you to think
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
back to the days when you were 13 or
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
14 and then fast forward to the days
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
that you were or
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
18 developmental changes take place
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
during those
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
years health education curriculum is
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
typically in most high schools offered
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh as a course either in grade n or
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
grade 10 so basically you're talking
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
about 13 14 or 15 year
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
olds um being experiencing these videos
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
in any of the legislation so again I
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
invite you to think back to to those
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
days um or those of you who may be
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
blessed to have children or
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
grandchildren who are age 14 and think
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
about how they might process the very
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
see often times I sit in this room
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
listening to people a sale public
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
education and poor math scores poor
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
language art scores and poor science
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
scores and basically poor poor
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
scores yet we continue in this body and
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
others to talk about additional
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
requirements placed on public school
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum expectations where does the
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
time come from for all of these
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
question Public Schools already have a
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
pretty full plate of things curriculum
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
decisions are best made at the local
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
level with locally elected officials and
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
those folks that are um picking up the
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
tab if you will uh I did some research
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
on this and there are some states who
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
have uh actually there's no States who
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
who require this uh particular set of
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
videos but there are states who pay more
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
for adequate public education who uh
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
require certain pieces of of um
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
instruction New Hampshire is not one of
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
those States who rank high in their
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
support of public education uh through
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would say that if this if
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is not um deemed
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislate as we believe it should be
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
that at least it be retained so that
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
more work can be done to make it a
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
better bill um and uh make it less
 
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.589 align:start position:0%
better bill um and uh make it less
prescriptive

00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps change the age
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
requirements you know
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
um but I just want you to understand
 
00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
that requiring this bill um to be taught
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
in health education classes is um at the
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
Freshman and sophomore level is
 
00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:18.030 align:start position:0%
Freshman and sophomore level is
particularly

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
challenging thank you very much thank
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
you questions representative M thank you
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you once again for
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony I always appreciate your
 
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
your testimony I always appreciate your
perspective

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
in regard to the free videos selected
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor did send them to us
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I did have the chance to watch them
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
I thought they were very thorough very
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
excellent however the prime sponsor
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
noted that he would be willing to say
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
not these particular videos but there
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
may be other videos available and I
 
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839 align:start position:0%
would say that goes into what you
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned about local control would you
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
be more willing to support this bill if
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
it said um School District shall show
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
videos which may include these but may
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
include another topic or something along
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.069 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh the the question that I
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
would raise is is it part of the what
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
the state has determined what what
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
health education standards have
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
determined as part of what kids and
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
health education classes need to know
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
and be able to do and so if the State
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
education standards require that then I
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
believe um that there would have to be
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
materials and and I would also suggest
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that by retaining the bill the
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee could meet with health
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
Educators and let me just say students
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
we have a a state school board this
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislature a couple of years ago passed
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
a requirement for school boards to have
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
student Representatives on school boards
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
why not engage in conversation with
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
student representatives of school boards
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
about what they think would be
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate as part of their education
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
not what necessarily a whole bunch of
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
adults think is appropriate for their
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
education thank you thank you
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%

thank you very much and thank you for
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um based on the
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
newest 306 rules which I haven't had
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
time to parse through all of them yet me
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
neither um and and maybe you would have
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
to get back to us with the answer maybe
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
one of the other people in the room may
 
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
have this in our current health
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum which I know my child had is
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
a ninth grader um when they discuss
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
reproduction and the reproductive
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
process is um the labor and delivery
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
process as well as
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
um abortion as well as contraception as
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
well as abstinence all included in that
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum or is it purely um that
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
people should be free to explore their
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
sexuality as uh someone previously
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
testified thank you for the question
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative I would have to get back
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
to you on that answer I uh I don't know
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
what the current standards speak
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
to representative Cornell Thank you
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
question I want to get back to the
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general she have cause of
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
action to Sue I don't know if you read
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
that part of it if you have any thoughts
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm thinking now the Attorney
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
General will sue if a school doesn't do
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
something that's not in the 306 plans
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
that they've been told to do thank you

forget to deliver the piece of um I'm
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
always concerned with any piece of
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that has a punitive
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
component that contains more money than
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity for providing the
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
resources that teachers and students
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
would need to achieve the purpose of the
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh when the state is
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
appropriating certain monies uh for
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
adjudication but not appropriating money
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
to provide resources training and uh
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
materials for kids that might be needed
 
00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
to support this legislation that is a
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%

visual representation of the stages of
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
human development from the fertilization
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
to birth this is not just a lesson in
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
biology but is all but an opportunity
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
for our students to gain a deeper
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of the human body's

towards the pre-born
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
children this in turn can lead to more

conclusion in conclusion the inclusion
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
of baby of meet baby Olivia video in our
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
school curriculum is not just about
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
teach teaching biology it's about
 
00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.549 align:start position:0%
teach teaching biology it's about
fostering

00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
fostering

encouraging critical thinking I ask you
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
to support HP
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
667 and help provide our students with
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
this non-political non-religious
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive educational on pre-born
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
human development thank you uh thank you
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
very much uh questions from the
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sellers for
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
bringing us forward and for showing us
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
those videos as well over email my
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
question is that this bill amends RSA
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
193e by inserting after section 3F a new
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
section that would be section g and the
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
previous Bill also is the same section
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
so if both were to pass does one
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
override the other or how would they
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
work if they're both the same section
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question it's if
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
they both pass one be become G and
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
wonder hi
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
G the next word what is H I need go back
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
to school yeah I I think um it's the
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
last uh bill that passes um that
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
language unless there's a modification
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment to the bill got it thank
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
you um represent s did you have a I did
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you sorry excuse me excuse me
 
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.910 align:start position:0%
uh thank you sorry excuse me excuse me
sir

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I was uh disconcerted for a moment
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
sure yes um thank you and thank you for
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um I have two two
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
questions one is just looking at the
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
live action site it it talks about its
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
stance on attempting to change people's
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
minds and
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
perspectives and you're claiming that
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:56:46.799 --> 00:56:48.349 align:start position:0%
it's a
nonpartisan

00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
nonjudgmental or whatever all the
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
various adjectives so um if they State
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
on their website that their goal is to
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
change people's minds and perspective
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
Ives um doesn't that indicate they are
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
taking a specific
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
stance yeah thank you for the question
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh so any case again I have to start
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere I'm not necessarily saying it
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be their V video there's also
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh an endowment for human development
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
which has a similar video uh which is
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely neutral and I think it's
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
either 5 minutes or 9 minutes long so we
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
could use that one as well ask follow up
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that you're adding in
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
addition to saying that this should
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
happen in high schools that this should
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
be a requirement for University students
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that although I
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
was not yet an adult when I arrived at
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
University the majority of people when
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
they get to University are adults and
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be able to make the
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves about whether or
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
video yes you would think so uh these
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
are uh state universities and State
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
community colleges so the state has the
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
right to say what they should or
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
doing representive Hall thank you for um
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak and thank you for
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you speak to
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
the tens of thousands of dollars that
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is in the fiscal note what you know
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
what that's
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
for I can only say the fiscal notes are
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
estimates right I they're estimates I
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of they just don't know how
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
much things will cost they put something
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
in there follow up yes uh in here it
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
does say that the um community college
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
system uh there's an estimate but
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
there's this 10 to 100,000 per year on
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
top the university system said um
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
so so my question is does that seem like
 
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of money we're showing a video uh
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
to me it is a lot of money and that's
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
why I believe it's just an estimate I I
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
can't believe it costing that much but
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
again I I don't know it's thank you it
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem right a represent
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
um represent I'm sure you're well aware
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's University system
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
is the least funded out of 50 states in
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that this additional cost to the
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
least funded University system in this
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
St is a problem my concern about the
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
university system is my question is that
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're asking for mature adults who are
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
over 18 years old to pay money to go to
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
college to sit there and watch a
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
three-minute video and then have the
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
university certifi that before you can
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
graduate you watch a three-minute
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
video that's what this bill says is that
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
was that your intent
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
the yes uh thank you for the question so
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
the intent is for every person entering
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
the university system or Community
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
College would see that video at least
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
once throughout their time being
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
there and
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
follow and if somehow the they don't
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
watch that and the university can't
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
certify that they don't graduate from
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
college they don't watch a three-minute
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
video on biological development again
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
this is no this would be no it's three
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
minutes when you actually do all your
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
paperwork signing into the Community
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
College you would look at that video for
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
3 minutes and it would be done it would
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
be all signed off just question to
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
clarify my my question is if they don't
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
watch that are you're saying that these
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
people cannot graduate from
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
college that's what I put in the Bill
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you resent
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative sellers for coming um in
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
front of us again so um knowing that all
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
freshmen have to take
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
orientation would this not be a good
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
video to put into that freshman
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
orientation and thank you for the
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
question and that would be perfect that
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be the exact time it should be
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
there um representative Bon thank you Mr
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
question um all other areas of
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
curriculum there is an opt out function
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
um that serves so that parents might
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
decide that they don't want their
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
children and in these grades to be able
 
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
to um to watch these videos and also if
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
you're an adult why shouldn't you be
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
out I didn't put that pres um pres I
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
sorry see no further questions thank you
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
very much thank you um I think we'll uh
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
limit uh testimony to 3 minutes uh for
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
everyone and that seems to be what is uh
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
on the cards that uh I have in front of
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
me um so we will uh check that time and
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
next uh call up representative Paige
 
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
bman if I pronounce that close to
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you Mr chair and yes it
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
was very close Bosman you said it slow
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
but it was right thank you to the
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
committee for having me here today um my
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
name is Paige bman I am a representative
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
from nasua I represent nashua's Ward 4 I
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
am here as a health care provider as
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
well as a parent I am a women's health
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
nurse for the last 15 years I work in a
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
sexual Wellness Clinic where I educate
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
patients as well as being certified as a
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
sexuality education excuse me as a
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
sexuality educator for grades K through
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
12 so I am here with that perspective I
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
will tell you that I did not watch the
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
movies um and the reason is because any
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
specific video should not be legislated
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
so whatever the video is I don't know
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
that that's in alignment with evidence
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
base with what the best curriculum would
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
be um the the this should be shown any
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
movie should be shown in context of the
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
rest of the curriculum with the students
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
in mind in terms of their maturity
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
levels their emotional health it needs
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
to be tailored to that audience and only
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
the instructor can do that it might be
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
different from school to school from
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
grade to grade from class to class it is
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
completely inappropriate to legislate
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
what a child would see now I don't think
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
anybody here would agree that a math
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
teacher should be writing English
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum or that someone in this room
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
should be writing mental health
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum the same goes for sexuality
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
education we should leave it to the
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
experts there are people who have
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
advanced degrees in this there are
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
people who have master degrees in
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
sexuality education there are Physicians
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
there are nurses Nurse
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
Practitioners we know how to write this
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum because that is what we do um
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
we use neutral scientific evidence-based
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
materials because we have access to them
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
and we know what the resources are I
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
would also like to say um as a parent I
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
agree with that option um what what was
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
brought up about opting out there's no
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
way I would ever allow my my own
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
children with the expertise that I have
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
to watch something that came about in
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
this way and I don't want my kids
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
missing school that day because there's
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
no option for an opt
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
out that's it for now thank you so much
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
much repr clug thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you mentioned
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
the word neutral do you believe that
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
neutral having seen the wording of baby
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
Olivia and and um and have I've heard a
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
few things about the video admittedly I
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
have not seen it um but what I've heard
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
even in this testimony is language that
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
is not generally considered neutral
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
language we the the best thing we can do
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
in sexuality education is prevent
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
present facts um and what one other
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
thing um is um excuse me I'm so sorry
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
um this of this information is already
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
included in sexuality education classes
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate way there's nothing
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
here and and that's because we want to
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
give the science behind it and so all of
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
this is already covered in most programs
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
and yet we have a huge fiscal note to
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
dictate something that is not
 
01:05:50.269 --> 01:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and is already being
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
provided thank you thank you rep cic
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:56.430 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
um my high school senior is currently
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
doing a dual enrollment class in child
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
development um and in the fall semester
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
a large portion of that was in fact
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
talking about the development from
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
gation actually pre- gestation um
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
because they had to look at you know how
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
sperm and egg happened to meet to create
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
gation as part of their curriculum about
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
it all the way through and they're now
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
working on the next level of Child
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
Development do you think it's essential
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
to have a video of any kind in order to
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
teach those skills or do you think that
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are other um materials that are
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
already in existence and already being
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
used either by Child Development
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
teachers or by Health Educators in the
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
school the high school level to cover
 
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
those topics without videos being
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
essential thank you so much for that
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
question um yes there are other videos
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
that exist and there are lots of other
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
materials um personally I have taught um
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
in a fifth and sixth grade uh sexuality
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
education class as well as currently I'm
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
teaching seventh and eth grade we go
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
over the stages of fetal development and
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
we do it with illustrations that can be
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
labeled um and so that's just one
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
example but as I said I'm not opposed to
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
videos um I think again that the
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
instructor needs to decide what is most
 
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the students in that
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
class and that's what I do as an
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
educator represent Terry yes uh thank
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
you so as you have uh read had reviewed
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
and spoken to the bill and um uh
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
evidently um understand the concern
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
expressed by the uh sponsor I just want
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be clear that I'm hearing you say as
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
a health educator that you believe that
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns that are expressed in this
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
bill are already adequately covered and
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
therefore it would be uh redundant in in
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
one sense and in another sense um the
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
the videos themselves are really not
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
necessary because you're already
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
including materials that would cover the
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
same topics and concerns that are
 
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
videos thank you for that question
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative I would say of course I
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
am not privy to every single sexuality
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
education course being delivered in the
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
state what I can say is that best
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
practice and the standard of this
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
education absolutely includes this I
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't know how you would teach somebody
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
about the reproductive system without
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
covering gestational development so that
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be my assumption unless it's a
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
very low quality program uh R
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
representative for coming in front of us
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
so I you you mentioned that you thought
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
the language um was not considered
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
neutral can you point out any specific
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
thing that led you to believe that the
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
language wasn't
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
neutral absolutely if you just let me
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
take a look here
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
um even just saying meet baby
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
Olivia is making an assumption in some
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
and I know this is debate um but making
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
an assumption either way about calling a
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
baby a baby already is not
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
scientific and so that does skew in a
 
01:09:20.159 --> 01:09:21.390 align:start position:0%
scientific and so that does skew in a
certain

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
argument thank you quickly please yeah
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
yeah actually I I I I um I yield thank
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you very
 
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:42.669 align:start position:0%
much for your
testimony

01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
Walter hello
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
again I'm Walter I am a clump of cells a
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
former fetal anomaly a high school
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
student and an aspiring parent and I
 
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
would like you to support HB
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
667 now why do I say I'm a clump of
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
cells because I am the human body is a
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
majestic thing and when we are in our
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
mother's womb that is no different the
 
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
science of prenatal development is an on
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
inspiring process Which is far more
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
important than frogs and clouds to the
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
average high
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
schooler in school we study how cells
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
work we study the formation of plants
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
and reproduction and the reproduction of
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
the tiniest forms of life such as
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
viruses and bacteria it follows that as
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
humans we need to learn about our own
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
species earliest development prenatal
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
development is an established science
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
and should not be reserved for those
 
01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.470 align:start position:0%
and should not be reserved for those
studying

01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
studying
 
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
medicine cellular
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
reproduction serves as proof that any
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
other organism is alive it is also true
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
of humans at their earliest
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
stages basic embryology demonstrates
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
that human zygotes
 
01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.110 align:start position:0%
that human zygotes
are

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
alive that they are the first diploid
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
cell of an organism which carries the
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
full genetic information for that
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
individual these cells feed grow and
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
reproduce in the 1970s ultrasound
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
imagery made it look as if we were a
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
strange blob in a pocket of
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
fluid today we can see things in great
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
detail using 4D
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds you using today's Imaging
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
doctors can see that by 7 weeks
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
gestation the beginnings of the human
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
form the head the eyes and the hands
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
become clearly visible by 8 weeks they
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
can see the baby's heartbeating by 12
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
Weeks the whole human form is visible
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
the babies have all of their organs and
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
they just need time to grow and to get
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
stronger it has been shown in prenatal
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
surgeries and early abortion procedures
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
that babies as early as
 
01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
that babies as early as
a

01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah to exact we have here pleas yes
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please keep this to the
 
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.669 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please keep this to the
bill

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay as an aspiring dad I want to know
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
the truth about my future children's
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
development to make sure that they can
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
live the best life possible as a former
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly I think it's important for
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
my generation to know the technologies
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
that doctors use to perform Sur iies on
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
Tiny children in the womb who may be
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
developing abnormally this may help to
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
demystify disabilities and to show how
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
new treatments love and support can make
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies less scary I ask you to
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
pass HB 667 so that students like me
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
will not be denied the truth about how
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
our bodies are formed and how our
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
children will be conceived grow and
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
develop from conception through birth
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
knowing how we are created gives us all
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
a greater appreciation for life for
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
courageous women who bear us into the
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
world God bless you and thank you very
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
much for your time thank you any
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um next is Sarah
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
mcneel and let's everyone try and keep
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
our comments the testimony to the bill
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
itself not on a broader uh topic um that
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
can be addressed uh maybe in future
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
legislation so let's stick to the bill
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
please uh good morning um representative
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
quid allei and um
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee my name is uh Sarah mcneel I'm
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
a parent and a recently retired
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
registered nurse I volunteered as a
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
court appointed special advocate for
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
abused and neglected children I did that
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
for a number of years I also worked for
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
a number of years at the um at a clinic
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
that performed
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
abortions um before and after the
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
abortion I was with the client
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
I strongly oppose House Bill 667 for
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
several reasons this three-minute video
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
which I did watch entitled meat baby
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
Olivia is clearly geared toward
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
indoctrination of a young minds calling
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
an embryo a baby and giving it a name
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
baby Olivia is totally misleading and
 
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
likely to be confusing to some
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
children I want to interrupt my what I
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
had written initially because some of
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
this testimony was written in part
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
because of the article in the newspaper
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
which was addressing this to grade
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
school children also not just 9th grade
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
and on so some of that indicates
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
this um another reason is the video
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
states that quote life begins at
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
fertilization and also says when a new
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
human being comes into existence many
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that statement given
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
their own religious and scientific
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
backgrounds there are several
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies about the gestational
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
development but I will leave that to
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
Physicians to
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
address however using words and phrases
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
such as quote
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
fertilization or spontaneous reflexive
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
movements and uter even the word uterus
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
are likely words not understood by some
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
children also this V video uses words
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
and phrases such as touching her face
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
sighing stretching playing and exploring
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
unquote which are also misleading as
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
being purposeful functions and also
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
addresses the viability of the fetus at
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
various developmental stages that just
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
true following a showing of this video
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
this is something I think everybody
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
needs to think about who's going to be
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for answering the questions
 
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
that these children may have these
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
students may have your young student
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
might say how did that baby get inside
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
the belly there's a lot of adults that
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
still don't know that but it it could
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
happen or uh will that will I have a
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
baby inside me at some point as I said I
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
was addressing more of a younger child
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
on this uh or what if I don't want a
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
baby inside me the way this video is
 
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
it's just a miracle of life it's going
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
to happen it doesn't even mail is never
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned at all it's just a miracle
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
that happens in in inside presumably a
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
woman's body an older child might ask
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
what does feralization
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
mean um just a couple things I um so
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
that was the questions who's going to
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
answer these questions my last thing was
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill it is mentioning that the
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
video will be shown to public school
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
children what about children that are
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or children that are in
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
private schools which seems to be more
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
and more an of an emphasis these days uh
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen about all these
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
children are they just not going to be
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
educated about the facts Al life or will
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
be left to their parents which probably
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
is the best way to do it
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
anyway I thank you I thank you very much
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you any questions
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
testimony I do have copies of it great
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that was appreciated
 
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
by the clerk in
 
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.270 align:start position:0%
by the clerk in
particular

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh members of
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
the committee again I am Kurt whoer I'm
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
chairman of New Hampshire right to life
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm here in full support of this
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill there's been a lot of serious
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
questions asked and I get I'd like to
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
give a couple my answers to a couple of
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
those questions one of them we just
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
heard was already a bias or or
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
or sounded like political uh
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
orientation in terms of the the this
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
video and what I can say to you is that
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
in my viewing of that video there is no
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
such thing even the ex the example of
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
misapplication of
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
terms my
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
understanding those were not inaccurate
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
they may not be what we call
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
scientifically correct in the sense of
 
01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.590 align:start position:0%
scientifically correct in the sense of
a

01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
baby and using that
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
term but all the terms that we use to
 
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.110 align:start position:0%
term but all the terms that we use to
describe

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
describe
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
humans from conception until death are
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
simply markers of one thing or
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
another they all describe the same human
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
being the same the baby is a fetus the
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
baby is this we become adolescents we
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
get old we become now whatever that is
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
all these adjectives that we use or or
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
synonyms are synonyms for the same thing
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's the human being who's the object
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
of abortion and who are being killed by
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
the millions in terms
 
01:19:12.679 --> 01:19:14.950 align:start position:0%
the millions in terms
of

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill simply presents asks that
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
public school children and I would agree
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
know about the miraculous development
 
01:19:30.679 --> 01:19:31.790 align:start position:0%
know about the miraculous development
that

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
occurs during a
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and I used her miraculous
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
carefully I saw that video I was amazed
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
at what happens at several
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
days I wasn't surprised by what happens
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
at several weeks or months I'm not very
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with those and I
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
children love this
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
information they just love it and will
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
they ask difficult questions yes but
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's an answer call that's above my
 
01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.189 align:start position:0%
there's an answer call that's above my
pay

01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
grade it's not within this just like
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
what you're right now you're not talking
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
to that bill when you get to the college
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
level I do agree there probably should
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
be an opt out but this is a
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
question that the law deals with all the
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
time right for whom do we mandate and to
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
whom do we give freedom to object so if
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's where the community thinks it
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
should go put it
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
in but it's just as important all the
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
way through and the video is not the
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
idea of calling baby
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
Olivia um yeah it's
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
prejudicial in the sense that the whole
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
video is prejudicial toward the value of
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
human life and our respect for it
 
01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
which by the way is a fundamental
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
Foundation of all of Western
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
Civilization so if you in
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
favor of keeping humans alive innocent
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
humans now that makes you biased
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
politically something no I urge you to
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
support the Bill thank you questions
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative wock thank you CH just a
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
clarification I want to make sure I
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
heard you accurately representative and
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
two comments I wrote down at I could
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
have screwed up you know I'm getting um
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
that you said that that some of the
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
terms in the video may not be accurate I
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
think that's what you I wrote down as
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
aot the argument against those bills is
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
that they're not used in the way that uh
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
medical professionals or
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
scientologists people who study these
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
things use them which is fine we don't
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
talk in about those in those terms those
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
terms i' I've seen plenty of videos I
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand I just question I just
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
repeating what you said okay the second
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
one I want to make sure I was correct he
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
said the video is not the video is
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
prejudicial yeah absolutely okay thank
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%

the the idea of a video
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
um is something that teachers do use but
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
in the early grades um Hands-On
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
learning um you know taking a direct
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
role in learning is so much more
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
valuable uh I saw kindergarten um
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
usually K the primary grades
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through three uh they would
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
teachers would have incubators and they
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
would hatch baby chicks sometimes baby
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
ducks one teacher actually was
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
successful in an aquarium in in raising
 
01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.590 align:start position:0%
successful in an aquarium in in raising
baby

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
baby
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
frogs um this this is something that
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
teaches gestational development in a
 
01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
very meaningful way to Little Children
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
um they chart the 21 days of the embryo
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
developing they candle the eggs um and
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
you can imagine how excited they are
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
when they hatch uh then empathy just
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
decision making these children care for
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
these baby chicks um and the families
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
are involved it's a very exciting way to
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
teach it's also a very developmentally
 
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate way I think that
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
teachers are experts in knowing the
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
materials to use knowing uh how their
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
children think how they learn and this
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of experience is something
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
meaningful and Lasting and does so much
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
more than simply showing a video thank
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions see none
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
except for representative Woodcock thank
 
01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman appreciate the ability
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
to clarify here principal thank you
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
welcome just a quick question in your
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
multiple years of being an educator and
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
principal have you ever seen uh valid
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
instruction that does not have a Q&amp;A
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
after a
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
video well thank you for that question
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
um good teaching always has Q&amp;A after
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
after every lesson especially videos
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
they need to be discussed in order to be
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
understood and thank you repr celic
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I just I didn't hear you say
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
specifically are you in favor of or
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill and I just wanted
 
01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:15.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure I make Mark and I may have
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
missed it because I was C make sure I
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
marked that I should have started with
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
that uh I am against Bill 667
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and the final card that I have
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
anel so in an effort to um keep things a
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
little more Bill oriented and uh I'm I'm
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
going to have to shove a little bit of
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
what I had planned to say and um and go
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit more based on my experience
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
so I should have probably mentioned that
 
01:26:12.669 --> 01:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
I am a career educator I've taught eight
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
years in high schools and um also been a
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh Faith formation director in my Parish
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
I've dealt with um kids who
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
have been from all walks of life um my
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
first job was a uh an inner city all
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
girls catholic
 
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
institution we would um
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
discuss just about everything because
 
01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.229 align:start position:0%
discuss just about everything because
they're

01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
girls and um and one of the things that
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
we uh delved into was prenatal
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
development as well as um IV f um
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
abortion and uh I had the privilege of
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
teaching the very first test Tu
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
baby in
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
Delaware um at that school and I and I
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
wanted I bring this up and it just kind
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
of hit me that I should bring this up
 
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
of hit me that I should bring this up
here

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
because there was no kid in that school
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
who had a better sense of how loved she
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
was and who she was as a human being
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
than that little girl it just wasn't
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
because she had her mother's Journal
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
about the whole experience all the
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
things she suffered all the money they
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
paid all the
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that they went through and it
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
was difficult for me as a teacher to
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
then go to her and say but you
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
understand how the process works and
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
there are some ethical problems with
 
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
that and I met with the parents and I
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
walked them through how I plan to teach
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
it um we set up debates we talked about
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
the issues kids were allowed to do
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
research on fetal development when it
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
develops properly as well as when there
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
are fetal anomalies both of my kids had
 
01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.550 align:start position:0%
are fetal anomalies both of my kids had
fetal

01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
fetal
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
anomalies and I was given my
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
options which just horrified me because
 
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
everything is so streamlined now to make
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
it so that women can report for any
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
reason without even counseling you know
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
up at Dartmouth they they H I know that
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
up at Dartmouth they gave me a sheet of
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
paper that just said fetal anomaly with
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
a code and that was my counseling I got
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
it in the in the
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
mail that was after my ultrasound so I
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
bring this up because I am very diff I'm
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
very concerned that we offer children a
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
standardized education we are concern
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about standardizing education
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
in every other realm except this one
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
this is the one where everybody fights
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
back because they don't want the words
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
to be used the fact that an a zygote
 
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
becomes an embryo becomes a fetus
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
becomes a baby becomes a human they are
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
all the same so I I I need to know that
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
you guys are invested in giving our
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
children the truth thank you very much
 
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and with
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
that we'll end the testimony on House
 
01:29:31.719 --> 01:29:32.950 align:start position:0%
that we'll end the testimony on House
Bill

01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
667 and move uh directly to House Bill
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
730 which is requiring school districts
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
to educate and provide information to
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
students regarding adoption during
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
health education for grades 9 through 12
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
and in college in certain
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances and um once again
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you uh thank
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and committee members
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
represented cellers Grafton 10 Bristol
 
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.510 align:start position:0%
represented cellers Grafton 10 Bristol
and

01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
bridgew I'm bringing this bill forward
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
because information is powerful and if
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
you have that information you can make
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
right or decisions what you think are
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
right or wrong ones if you don't have
 
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
right or wrong ones if you don't have
the

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
information so knowing that are
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
our teens and young adults are sexually
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
active and and could end up with an
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
unexpected pregnancy I would want them
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
to know that this information's out
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
there and a lot of them don't know they
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
don't know they don't even know where to
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
get the information or where it is or
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's out there now this one doesn't
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
require any video it's just information
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
and again this one looks at if there's a
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
if they're doing a um a clinic if I
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
remember the bill correctly that they
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
would provide this at this
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
point the other reason I'm bringing this
 
01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
up too is and I'm not going to keep this
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
long is that there's 36 families waiting
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
for every sing every one child to be
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
adopted I mean people are waiting a long
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
time to be adopted and these kids at
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
least will have an option to their
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
unexpected pregnancy knowing that they
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
could have have someone else adopt their
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
baby and even
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
today there are there are many types of
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
adoptions but the the two of the most
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
common is are called open and closed
 
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
adoption an open one of course is you
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
know where your child is going and you
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
may have more interaction throughout the
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
child's years of growing versus a closed
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
you don't know anything about the
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
adopted parents or where your child has
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
gone so having this information I
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
believe is very powerful
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
for the kids at this point from grades 9
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
College I can only say the number of
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
waiting families for adoption continues
 
01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.629 align:start position:0%
waiting families for adoption continues
to

01:32:07.629 --> 01:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
rise there are people that want these
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
babies thank you and I hope you'd
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
support HB 730 thank you very much
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative SEL thank you
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at this saying that
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a minimum of an hour
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
discussion related to adoption are we
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
prescribing that level of um State
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
control over any other area of
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum mandating specific numbers of
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
hours or minutes to talk about a single
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
individual topic whether or not it's
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the students in front of
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
us uh thank you for the question I don't
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
know if we mandate exactly the time
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
frame I don't know that however uh
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
thinking back and looking at this I know
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of class um time that's
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
either in 40 minute segments or I
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
believe a uh an hour and 20 minute
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
segments so can I follow yes is it
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
therefore your assertion that the state
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
should make a determination about the
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
specific amount of time any given
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
subject is taught as opposed to leaving
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
that to local control and local decision
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
makers the point I was trying to thank
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
you for the question the point I was
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
trying to make is that the the the kids
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
out the student students need to have
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
time to understand and also there's a
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
lot of information out there on adoption
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then and my point is is that they're
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
going to be talking as question and
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
answers will probably take up that
 
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
hour so
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative um
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
within the bill you enumerate that you
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
believe the Attorney General should have
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh through parents
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
on enforcements of this issue what
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
impact to our judicial judicial system
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General's office could
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
there be and have you received any
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
feedback on that uh thank you for the
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
question no I haven't heard any feedback
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the point of the journey attorney
 
01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.270 align:start position:0%
that the point of the journey attorney
general

01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
is you want I wanted to see this bill as
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
far as adoption being taught as long as
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's being taught there's no reason for
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to get involved if
 
01:34:26.109 --> 01:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's not there are some school districts
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
ignore thank you very much uh
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you Mr
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us again I too share
 
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
a concern about um that Clause with the
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general um would you be open to
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
taking that particular portion out of
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
this bill because the rest of the bill
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
has an immense amount of Merit but that
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
I am also concerned with we don't put
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
that type of penalty on any other thing
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
in our education system right now so
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to have that um
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
deleted uh thank you for the question
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely again this bill becomes your
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
bill now and uh I would just hope that
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
the bill would go forward in one form or
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
another and it would
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
be um thank you for your testimony and
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this legislation thank
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
you next is representative
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee I again I'm Paige boschman I
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
represent nashaa W 4 I am here again
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
today um and I would like to emphasize
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
um that I work per Dum at the nashaa
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health in our
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
sexuality Wellness Clinic where I do STI
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
and STD testing and counseling all day
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
long so when I first saw saw this I'm
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
not really clear what STI and STD has to
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
adoption um it's about STI and STDs are
 
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
about preventing infection so there are
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
many people coming in who aren't even
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
trying to get pregnant aren't thinking
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
about getting pregnant and
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
frankly many people who come in to get
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
STI testing are embarrassed it takes a
 
01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
lot for them to get there they may not
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
want to go there and I understand I work
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
in public health but this is similar to
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
the kinds of clinics you would see on
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
college campuses so I do believe that
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is um a similar um transfer of
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
information and experience because
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
college students are young adults and
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
that's who I see I see kids and people
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
that age all the time um what I'm afraid
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
of is that this creates an extra barrier
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
or another piece um that folks in this
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
situation probably don't want to sit
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
through they want to go they want to get
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
their STI and STD tested they want to
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
get in and out they don't want to be
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
kept in listening to information that
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
they're not there to hear about and I am
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
afraid that that will keep people from
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
coming into the clinics and so this I do
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
believe has the potential to increase
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
the risk of HIV STDs STI and unintended
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
pregnancies because we don't have people
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
coming in to get that education right if
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
they've got an STI or an STD they need
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
some education around safer sex
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
practices and I'm really afraid that
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
this will decrease the number of people
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
coming in to get that um I do want to
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
add um that I uh as a healthc care guyy
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
nurse I'm often the first person who
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
will talk to a person when they call and
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
say I think you know I think I might be
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
pregnant and you learn never to say
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
congratulations because some people want
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and some people don't and so
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way to handle that as a
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
provider is that some people did not
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
intend to get pregnant but they're happy
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
about it some people did not intend to
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
get pregnant and they're not happy about
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
it and so good care is giving them all
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
their options we want every patient to
 
01:38:08.109 --> 01:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
be fully informed before they make their
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
decision so I can tell you that in every
 
01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
place that I've worked and even when I
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
had staff people are required under my
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
management I can't say everywhere um but
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
this would be best practice to give the
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
option of adoption anywhere that I've
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
had resources we have equal resources we
 
01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
have abortion we have health care
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
providers and we have adoption resources
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
because that's good care oh I'm so
 
01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
sorry finally I just wanted to say that
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note again is over
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I'm curious why we want to
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
spend that amount on education that
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
should be happening anyway if Healthcare
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
Providers are are meeting the standards
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
of their profession which I'd like to
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
assume most are
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you I see no
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much again for
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
antel good afternoon and hello again I
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
would like you to support HB
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
730 to that extent I would like to be
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
statistic that according to HHS there
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
are sadly over 1,000 children that are
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire state adoption
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
system on my page there is a
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
link that is 1,000 children without a
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
home or a family now no matter what
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
political party you are on whether you
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
are left or right I think we all want
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
that number to be
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
zero if our generation are going to be
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
the ones to solve this problem of Orphan
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
children struggling to find homes then
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
we need to understand the adoption
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
process its flaws and failings as well
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
as its Joys and its
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
successes and to make the process easier
 
01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
for families who would otherwise turn to
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
more expensive flawed and risky
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
procedures like abortion or
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
IVF because abortion was never meant to
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
be used as birth control no young woman
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
wants to grow up and have an abortion
 
01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
they dream of the day that they'll have
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
a family abortion always ends in a dead
 
01:40:21.199 --> 01:40:28.229 align:start position:0%
a family abortion always ends in a dead
baby

01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
sorry so I I believe that teaching the
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
next generation is the fastest and most
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
sure way to get anything done and that
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
there is an urgent need to solve this
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
problem of the Thousand children without
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
homes and we need to learn how to deal
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
with this problem in a way that does not
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
just write many of these kids off to
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
abortion before they are born so help us
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
to have the information to be able to be
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
the generation where the Thousand
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
becomes zero and we all homeless
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
children have a real and loving home I
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
ask you to please support HB 730 God
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
bless you and thank you for your
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for your
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
anel hi again my name is Charlotte and I
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
would ask you to support HB 730
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
I've been privileged to know many
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
families who have adopted children of
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
all ages and abilities some of them have
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
adopted many children with
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
disabilities some of them adopt children
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
who have fatal
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
diagnoses to love them for as long as
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
they have them because they need a place
 
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.470 align:start position:0%
they have them because they need a place
to

01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
be these
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
people these people give me
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
hope in a way that frankly pardon me
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
most of the discussion today has
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
not I want more than anything for our
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
children to recognize these people as
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
Heroes we need to
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
destigmatize adoption what people
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
hear about adoption usually revolves
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
around what's going on in the foster
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
care system
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of horror stories and
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
they're true they're absolutely
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
true our kids are already watching
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
videos about this there was a recent
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
release of a movie called The Sound Of
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
Hope the story of Pome Trot in Texas
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
where an entire church decided to
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
empty the foster care system and adopt
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
all of the children in spite of what
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
that meant for them financially
 
01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.830 align:start position:0%
that meant for them financially
personally

01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
through their marriages with dealing
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
with their own kids and all of
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
it and because they pulled together as a
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
community they gave everyone hope and
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
they made a video about it and it
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
inspired thousands of people who
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
attended that video is sure Charlotte if
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
we could stick to the bill please so I
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
would ask really that we give every tool
 
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
we can we that we bring in people to
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
talk about their experiences through the
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
adoption process that our children are
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
given what they need to be able to fix a
 
01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
very broken system because there is an
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
urgent need these children have lives at
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
stake and it's not enough to say how are
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
we going to pay for this or what is it
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
that we're going to you know where are
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
we going to find the
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
time we're talking about the lives
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
nothing less than the lives of our
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
future kids and their families so we
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
need to give them the tools thank you
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and one more uh person um
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative Lorie
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
policy thank you thank you chairman
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you committee um I had no plan on
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
talking on this bill today but um I just
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
felt like I should um my name is laori
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
coren I live in Berlin um I am a Foster
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
and adoptive mother um I I my husband
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
and I adopted our two boys um from the
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
foster care system um depending on the
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
day I would or would not recommend it
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
um but I am today a grandma because of
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
it and there's nothing better in the
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
world um I can say I don't want to say
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
how long ago I was in school
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
because that will tip you off on too
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
much information um but I remember
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
learning a lot of things in school I
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
remember learning the Pythagorean
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
theorem I remember learning the
 
01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.589 align:start position:0%
theorem I remember learning the
quadratic

01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
quadratic
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
equations I remember learning that you
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
know if I ever got into trouble um with
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
an unplanned pregnancy that I could
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
either have the baby or abort the baby
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
but I was never taught about the
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
abortion statistics in the US I was
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
never taught that there's a waiting list
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
right now in every state in the nation
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
those are waiting lists of people ready
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
willing and just dying for the chance to
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
adopt a
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
baby I think it's a great idea to put
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
adoption education in our Public School
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
much I guess
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh that ends our testimony on House Bill
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're okay y so um as soon as our Prime
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor gets here we'll uh commence with
 
01:46:14.109 --> 01:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
 
01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
557 relative to the information that
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we'll open the
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 557 relative to
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
the information that appears on the
 
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
school budget ballot and we welcome uh
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%

um thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
education policy Administration
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Alexander I
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
represent the town of gos toown I'm I'm
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
here to introduce this on behalf of my
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
my State Rep um representative Barry who
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
was unable to be here today um this bill
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
is pretty straightforward I think it
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
adds um additional context and
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
transparency to a school district ballot
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
so what would happen is um once the B
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
once the budget is adopted during a
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
deliberative session it goes to a ballot
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
um the new requirement under this if
 
01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
this law were to pass would be to add um
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
a couple um contextual things to the
 
01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
ballot to inform voters of what's
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
happening in their school district um
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
from my experience in gtown in
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
particular um we have a deliberate
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
session and they go really really in
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
depth on the budget and and there's um
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
strong presentations and you know voters
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
get a lot of detail but unfortunately
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's only about 300 voters right
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
right like I mean there's just people
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
that don't show up to these things um
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
which is not a good thing we should have
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
more involvement and I think that by
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
informing the the actual voters on town
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
meeting day
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh some of this information will be
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
helpful in their decision-making process
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
so the information that would be added
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
is the average cost per pupil defined by
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
the average daily enrollment um of the
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
preceded year the average daily
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment for the district for the
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
previous five years and the average
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
fulltime teacher to administrative
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
ratio um so like I said I think this is
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward I'm not like the
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know the expert on it but I do know
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
that um I serve on a budget committee I
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
think this is pretty reasonable request
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
so um with that I'm happy to take
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh any
 
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Alexander
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative babon thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
I served on school boards and I've never
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
seen anything on a ballot that would
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
present this type of information a
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
Warren article on a ballot is specific
 
01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:15.639 align:start position:0%
to the question at hand it does not
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
typically have any contextual
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
information on it as at all so I'm
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
wondering why you feel that this is
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
important to put on a ballot well I I
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for making my point I think
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
there should be contextual information
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
to how the school budget um is
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
functioning I I think there's not enough
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
information for voters so I think in
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
some ways um in gtown for instance last
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
year our school budget went down because
 
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
voters were um concerned about the
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
rising taxes but they didn't know the
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
context of the per people enrollment and
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
other things and I think if this
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
information is on the ballot it could
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
support support our local schools and
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know um help with the budget
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
followup please yes um most uh towns or
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
um communities usually send out
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
newsletters or put out information that
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
provides the context for what you would
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
be voting on and I know that there was a
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill last year that actually um had this
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
information must be presented at the
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions so I don't see
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
we've already given that to the public
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
twice why it need to be on the ballot so
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
again it seems redundant and it seems
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate I don't think informing
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
voters is inappropriate and I don't
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
think it's a
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
redundant I don't think you can be too
 
01:51:38.589 --> 01:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
redundant rident Murray uh thank you Mr
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
ter for taking my question thank you
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
representative um so one of my questions
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
is around I think what uh representative
 
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
balbon was saying around voter guides um
 
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
packets that exist at the table when you
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
check in that have all of the slide
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
Decks that are about to be shared and
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
also um the school board's continual
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with the voting public in
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
their meetings throughout the academic
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
year that inform voters about
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
enrollments about changes in budgeting
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
um there are also budget committees that
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
discuss these things so I guess to that
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
end I am curious to know whether or
 
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
not putting this on the actual ballot
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
itself could potentially lead to other
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
confusion for the voter no thank you for
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
the question I don't think so I mean I
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
like I said I serve as chair of the
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
budget committee and I mean these are
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
conversations that come up but keep in
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
mind that you know the voters that want
 
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
to access this information will find the
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
information there are voters that go in
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
and vote and um you know there's I mean
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
in gown what do we have like 30
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
different things to vote on in March and
 
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
it gets to be something overwhelming for
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
voters so having you know where they
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
have to do research on 30 different
 
01:52:52.119 --> 01:52:53.310 align:start position:0%
have to do research on 30 different
articles

01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
articles
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
um that seems to be a lot so I think by
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
informing voters on this specific school
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
budget I think is important because it
 
01:53:02.589 --> 01:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
is like I said a very vital piece of the
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
ballot and um based on rsas it doesn't
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
appear right at the top it appears like
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
further down the ballot so this will
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
help inform voters and I think it I
 
01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important but the voter guide
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
is a valuable resource and the
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
information that's given at delivera a
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
valuable resource but I don't think
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
there can be there can be
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
more follow thank you Mr chair
 
01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
to that end I guess my other question is
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
are there any Associated cost with
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
potentially having to print a ballot
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
that would be maybe two pages or three
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
pages if we're continuing to put all of
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
this information in the um underneath
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the multiple warrants uh on the
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
actual ballot itself yeah that's a good
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
question and um you know you live in
 
01:53:44.669 --> 01:53:44.679 align:start position:0%
Amherst right so um I think like my
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
ballots like four pages or five pages in
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
golf toown it really just depends I
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
think there there may be an added cost
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
right but I mean when you vote on town
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
meeting day they hand you like four
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper and you're just like
 
01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
please flip it over flip it overlip it's
 
01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
like it's a lot but I think it's a cost
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
that obviously there's not a fiscal note
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
on it so I don't think that anybody
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
thinks it's a significant
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
cost represent Hall thank you Mr chair
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question can
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
you speak to how this affects sb2
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
districts well I I anticipate that this
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not the election law expert
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
on this I think I'm just referring to
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our small our SP2
 
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
towns um so I can't speak to like the
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
cities in particular if that's what
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
you're referring to okay thank you
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
because if if they have a traditional
 
01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.149 align:start position:0%
because if if they have a traditional
town

01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
meeting there wouldn't be a ballot and
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
they would provide the information at
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
meeting does that make does that answer
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
well okay Corell thank you thank you for
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking my um my question is about lines
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
11 through 13 um the average full-time
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
teacher to administrator ratio I don't
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
know if you know we have a bill before
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
us about part-time teachers who would
 
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
teach under 20 hours so I don't know how
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
that would affect this because we could
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of the part-time teachers who
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
would be there to teach different
 
01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:21.719 align:start position:0%
classes and also administrator means all
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
other full time positions what do you
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
what would be included under
 
01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.669 align:start position:0%
what would be included under
that

01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:32.189 --> 01:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
so full so the question the first
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
question about part-time teachers I
 
01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
believe that school districts measure
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
this on um part-time or or equivalencies
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
to full-time positions so that's how I
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
would read the law is like if it's a
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
part-time it's like a point4 of a
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
teacher or 0 five of a teacher depending
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
on how many hours they spend at
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
instruction so that's how IID read the
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
the law on the first one and regardless
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
to administrators it says means all
 
01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
other full-time positions I think we're
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
talking about um positions like special
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
ed coordinator um yeah but that aren't
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
that aren't primarily associated with
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
educating our children in in in an
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
educational space follow up follow
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's not clear to me though because it
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
says all other full-time positions could
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
it mean the custodians could it mean the
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
nurse could it mean the guidance
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
counselor um
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
cafeteria workers oh I mean that's a
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
great question I don't think that
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
anybody's uh um trying to lead people on
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
and saying like custodians are
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
administrators so if there's something
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
that you would like to clear up the
 
01:56:39.149 --> 01:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
language I'm sure the sponsor would be
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
grateful for but um I I don't think that
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
we're it's fulltime trying to imply that
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
custodians are administrators and I
 
01:56:48.910 --> 01:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody would think that but
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
but but it follow up follow but somebody
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
could interpret it that way guess so
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Sky could be light blue
 
01:56:59.550 --> 01:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
today as opposed to dark blue uh further
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%

a year ago uh the second aspect that we
 
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
have um representative Cornell we had
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
the same question about um administrator
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
means all other full-time positions all
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
other full-time positions could be
 
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
custodians a school nurse um I don't
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
know pair professionals are are working

on the Department of Education website
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to see the average cost
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
per pupil the Department of Education
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
has been um uh actively um advocating
 
01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
awareness of I believe it's called the I
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
platform um the school boards
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
Association has done webinars um with
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
the Department to bring that to light to
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
our school board members um and pres
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
will be out to the community alarm just
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
to how to find whatever data and
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
information that you want to find about
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
your particular School District um
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
further uh we know that the school
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
district is required to have a budget
 
01:59:36.430 --> 01:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
hearing under RSA 32 um prior to annual
 
01:59:38.109 --> 01:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
meetings and prior to the budget being
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
presented some communities have budget
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
committees um where the budget committee
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
is hosting the um uh the budget hearing
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
we have deliberative sessions uh where
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
voters can ask questions so there's
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
certainly other Public public uh public
 
01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for V voters ask questions
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
um about average teacher salary number
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
of Staff number of Administrators so on
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so forth um and last um I just as
 
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
always when we get bills like this why
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
just school districts um if it's good
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
for school districts and transparency is
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
the goal to make voters more informed um
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
this should apply to towns cities
 
02:00:13.069 --> 02:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
Village districts and maybe the state
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
budget maybe we can require some of
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
these things to be put into house bill
 
02:00:18.030 --> 02:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
too about the number of state employees
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
and the number of salaries for agency
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
heads and so on and so forth so uh with
 
02:00:24.069 --> 02:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
that the school boards Association
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
opposes House Bill 557 and I'm happy
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you represent of
 
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
selling C can you just um at the
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
beginning you gave us a specific um bill
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
number could you say that again but
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
slowly please yes so RSA 189 colon 76 I
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
forget the bill number from last year
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
but that that law became effective July
 
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:46.589 align:start position:0%
but that that law became effective July
1

02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
1
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
2025 thank you very much so I guess it's
 
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
not effective now I just my mistake I
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
just realized we delayed that a year but
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
but anyway it it it it would be required
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward thank you I just couldn't
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
write as fast as you spoke if you could
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
the effective date again yeah I'm sorry
 
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I I may have misspoke earlier
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli the effective
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
date is July 1
 
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
2025 so let's say this this bill did
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
become law they would becoming law
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
concurrently anyway because this
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
certainly is not going to be on the
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
ballot in in another six weeks or
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
whatever at your at your annual meeting
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
so representative Freeman
 
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um for
 
02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us so would you not
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
agree that this is very different than
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
posting the information as opposed to
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
printing it on a ballot it's think of
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
the question representative sure it's
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
certainly different than posting it on
 
02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
the website than having it on the ballot
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
in front of the voters as they're voting
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
but my point is that the information is
 
02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
already being required to be distributed
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
to the voters in the community at large
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
anyway via the website and via the
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
ability of people to ask questions at
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
the budget hearing um and not even just
 
02:01:53.550 --> 02:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
the budget hearing the budget committee
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
meetings are supposed to be posted
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
anyway so there's ample opportunity for
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
the public to attend budget meeting
 
02:02:01.069 --> 02:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
budget committee meetings um school
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
board meetings and the deliberative
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
session to ask these questions without
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
it having to be printed on the
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
ballot thank you I see no further
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh except for representative s
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
sorry my kicking in slowly um would
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
School boards uh school yeah uh saus
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
print their ballots for their to the
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
School elections um would this add extra
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
cost do you believe thank you for the
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
question uh representative I mean I I
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
really don't know I did hear
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh Alexander's comments
 
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
let's say it was an extra page and let's
 
02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
say the average ballot is four pages
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
long you know and I don't know how many
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
ballots are usually printed up in a town
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander from GF town I
 
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
believe so let's say a thousand so 10
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
cent a page times another thousand maybe
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
an extra $100 so presumably there could
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
be but I mean without looking through
 
02:02:54.669 --> 02:02:54.679 align:start position:0%
you know all the ballots and all the
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
communities it hard for me to ascertain
 
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
02:03:01.629 --> 02:03:01.639 align:start position:0%
you now I think we're done all right
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
02:03:03.679 --> 02:03:06.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
much

02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh oh I'm
 
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:12.280 align:start position:0%

02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
watching um that's wonderful Mr chair so
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%

02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
Associated exe executive director of New
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrators
 
02:03:32.910 --> 02:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
Association I'm not going to repeat the
 
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
points that uh Mr Christina has made uh
 
02:03:37.629 --> 02:03:37.639 align:start position:0%
but we did there were some questions
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
that um were raised in in my mind in
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill first we agree
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
transparency voter education
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
understanding school school budgets
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential we wish more people
 
02:03:51.069 --> 02:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
would take the time to actually become
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
more educated about school budgets and
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
attend those school board meetings when
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
they're presented and listen and hear
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
the dialogue understand the
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
justification and rationale for things
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
so we are not we are all about
 
02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
transparency and support and
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of school district budgets
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that came to mind
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
in reading this
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
um reading this bill um on line six
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
section two immediately proceeding the
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
question um the following information
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
shall be presented one of the questions
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
that came to mind is one other committee
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere here in this building has
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
talked about electioneering and I don't
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
know what the interface of
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
electioneering and putting information
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
detailed information on a ballot would
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
be what that interface would be I just
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm I'm not a smart guy just
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things that causes me
 
02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
to wonder could there be a potential
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
legal issue if you had detailed
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
information on a ballot as opposed to
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
another set of information and and I I
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
would cite that when I was the
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent at kirar um we had a
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
deliberate session and all of the
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
detailed information was handed out at
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
the deliberative session everything was
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
there that people needed to know to
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
support ask questions query the
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
administration on who makes what who
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
does what it was all in a separate piece
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
my question is if that information
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
becomes part of the ballot does that
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
constitute electioneering or does it
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
constitute a potential if something's
 
02:05:23.470 --> 02:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
Miss stated does it constitute a legal
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
challenge that then the school district
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
has to incur in defending the B I don't
 
02:05:28.079 --> 02:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
has to incur in defending the B I don't
know

02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
um Barrett talked about the bills last
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
year um same question as raised by I
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
believe representative Cornell if uh
 
02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
what what classifies as an
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
administrative position I I don't know
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
uh what that would be as a
 
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent um and trying to build a
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
budget I would probably in all honesty
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
try to include anything that could be
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
construed as an administrative position
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
but does that need definition the IT
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
director the special ed director the
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
facilities director are the the
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
principal the assistant principal um in
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
the in the schools what are
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
administrative positions I think that
 
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.069 align:start position:0%
administrative positions I think that
needs

02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:06:10.079 --> 02:06:12.470 align:start position:0%
needs
clarification

02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:15.870 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
and the part-time question um if in fact
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
part time uh full-time positions are
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
being measured to the question of how
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
does part-time
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
apply a suggestion could be made that
 
02:06:31.159 --> 02:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
apply a suggestion could be made that
full-time

02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
equivalence would be a more appropriate
 
02:06:38.549 --> 02:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
um wording of this because there are
 
02:06:40.109 --> 02:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
especially in some of our small rural
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
districts there are a number of
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
part-time positions all added up you
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
know a million here A Millionaire it all
 
02:06:48.549 --> 02:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
counts for something but if you have a
 
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
halftime music and a halftime art that
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't NE necessarily factor into this
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
language so if is if you're really
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the um full-time equivalence
 
02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
of of that's more transparent in terms
 
02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
of what you're hiring and have on hand
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
for Staffing um providing instruction
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
and that's all thank you very much any
 
02:07:11.549 --> 02:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:07:13.709 --> 02:07:13.719 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us so would you
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
not agree that um as of late most
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions aren't very well
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
attended seeing as you were the
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent kage I'm sure you've seen
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
before thank you for the question
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman and and I would
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree that especially
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
citing kage I think their session was
 
02:07:37.390 --> 02:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
pretty well attended most recently so um
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
and it would be my experience and and
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
again I can speak to mine I haven't been
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
at other places when I was in sau6 the
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
Brentwood uh School District meeting
 
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
Full House you know had to have lots of
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
chairs in the gym people standing around
 
02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:54.679 align:start position:0%
so people participate in in governance
 
02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
when given the opportunity thank you
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray thank
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and thank you for taking
 
02:08:02.549 --> 02:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
my question wouldn't you also agree that
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
do um in addition to in-person
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
attendance there's also another modality
 
02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
that folks can watch things virtually um
 
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
and can be informed that way as
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Mary I do believe that
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of opportunities for
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
people to observe through uh televised
 
02:08:22.589 --> 02:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
school board meetings through televised
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions and televised
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
meetings or or um otherwise projected
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
those who want to procure information
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
can thank you uh representative
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um something you
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
brought up kind of strike struck me as
 
02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
another potential issue with the um
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
positions is I my uh district is part of
 
02:08:49.629 --> 02:08:49.639 align:start position:0%
an SAU and there are also Co-op
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
situations where we share and
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
administrators and in terms of figuring
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
that out I mean how do I figure it out
 
02:08:59.950 --> 02:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
like Ry has a certain percent you can't
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
really spell out how much time an
 
02:09:05.549 --> 02:09:05.559 align:start position:0%
Administration is spending on my town Ry
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
or opposed to what's Greenland or
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
Newington or Newcastle I mean I don't I
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
have no idea how you would Define that
 
02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
do you see also see that an issue with
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
co-ops thank you for the question uh I
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
would submit uh representative bbon that
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes there there's an some consideration
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
again I defer back to the experience in
 
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
sau6 um various central office people
 
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
had various responsibilities in the
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
smaller communities in the smaller towns
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
as well as responsibilities to the ler
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
Co-op and SST uh and the SAU as as an
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
umbrella as a body and I I also um one
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the questions actually that just came
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
to mind is in responding to
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bon's question is where
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
did contracted service providers uh fit
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
into the full-time part-time staff um
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
right because you if and I think about
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
special education a lot of special
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
education um service providers right now
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
are contracted services so how does that
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
if you trying to be transparent to the
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer about where the money's going
 
02:10:13.709 --> 02:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
then how do the how do the contracted
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you see no further questions
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
um I thinkk you oh I'm sorry here thank
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question are seus
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
unhappy with what they do right now
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
generally speaking you know the whole
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
part do they need
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
this no we're happy bunch of
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
people thank
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
02:10:43.229 --> 02:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
selig thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
my question so I know that my school
 
02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
district o River we have our own Fleet
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
of buses and our own internal bus
 
02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
drivers but I know that that's not
 
02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
common across the state do you have a
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
sense of how many districts subcontract
 
02:11:00.549 --> 02:11:00.559 align:start position:0%
out two external bus companies versus
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
having an internal one and how that
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
would factor into this and they would be
 
02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative S I do not have the
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
information in terms of who are their
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
self um transportation providers versus
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
who trans uh who contracts with others
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
but once again there's a full-time
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
part-time service component if you will
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
of personnel that's providing service to
 
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:24.679 align:start position:0%

03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
copies of our first bill uh for the
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon which is House Bill
 
03:36:42.670 --> 03:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
394 and it's relative to the powers and
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
duties of Cooperative School District
 
03:36:47.150 --> 03:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
budget committees and the role of
 
03:36:49.229 --> 03:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District Board member
 
03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives on such
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
committees and um our Prime sponsor is
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
here welcome uh to this education
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee this is becoming a very
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
familiar room for me thank you for
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
having me um those of you who were on
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
the education committee last term uh
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
heard from me when I presented two bills
 
03:37:15.870 --> 03:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
and those two bills uh relating to
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District budget
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
committees were both ultimately referred
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
to interim
 
03:37:23.910 --> 03:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
study and in the interim Study
 
03:37:27.030 --> 03:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
deliberations last fall um they were
 
03:37:29.950 --> 03:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation and
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
discussion I uh concurred with the
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion that they be merged into one
 
03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill so 394 will look familiar to some
 
03:37:38.319 --> 03:37:40.189 align:start position:0%
bill so 394 will look familiar to some
of

03:37:40.189 --> 03:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:42.469 --> 03:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
you HB
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
394 has two distinct purposes
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
they're severable but they fit into the
 
03:37:50.710 --> 03:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
general question of what we're asking
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
our Cooperative School District budget
 
03:37:55.630 --> 03:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
committee to do for us and so I think
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to have them in one
 
03:38:00.630 --> 03:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill speaking to them one at a
 
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
time what the bill does in line 15 14
 
03:38:04.840 --> 03:38:05.790 align:start position:0%
time what the bill does in line 15 14
and

03:38:05.790 --> 03:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
15 is it simply says that the school
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
boards ex officio members sitting with
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
the budget committee
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
will not have a
 
03:38:22.349 --> 03:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
vote and uh so why why why do I think
 
03:38:24.750 --> 03:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
necessary first of all the purpose of
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
the budget committee is to provide
 
03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
expertise to provide
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
focus and uh to provide some form of
 
03:38:39.550 --> 03:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
check and balance in terms of creating
 
03:38:41.429 --> 03:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
the budget with the administration and
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
the school
 
03:38:47.590 --> 03:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
board and the statutes say that a budget
 
03:38:49.870 --> 03:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
committee will be comprised it will be
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
composed exactly in the same manner as
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
the as the school
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
board so taking uh I represent
 
03:39:00.750 --> 03:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
Charlestown Newport Unity Charlestown is
 
03:39:02.750 --> 03:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the Fall Mountain uh
 
03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
Regional School District it's one of
 
03:39:05.319 --> 03:39:06.469 align:start position:0%
Regional School District it's one of
five

03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
towns and uh there's a delicate balances
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
I think there is in most of these
 
03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
districts it's a seven uh seat school
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
board with five prior districts and each
 
03:39:20.349 --> 03:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
of those towns has one dedicated uh
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
board seat and then there are two at
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
large so naturally you would expect from
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
the statute that the budget committee
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
would also have seven members five from
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
each of the towns and two at large but
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
lo and behold we now take one member of
 
03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
the school board and add them in and
 
03:39:43.590 --> 03:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
give them a vote and the result is a
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
little weird so
 
03:39:49.950 --> 03:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
it means that the balance of the seven
 
03:39:52.030 --> 03:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
each Town having a representative and
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
the voters at large deciding the other
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
two is thrown off it means that instead
 
03:40:00.150 --> 03:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
of the statutory designed to have an odd
 
03:40:02.670 --> 03:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
number of votes we end up with an eighth
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
vote and an even one and we have
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
situations where that results in very
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
ambiguous outcomes and
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
guidance and uh it means that we have
 
03:40:17.950 --> 03:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
given one individual ual uh extra power
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
to have a vote on both boards I
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
coincidentally the Fall Mountain
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
deliberative session is this evening
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
I've spent a fair bit of time looking at
 
03:40:29.710 --> 03:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
the warrant and uh there are quite a few
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:40:34.510 --> 03:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
warrants that uh involve a different
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
vote from the school board and from the
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
budget committee and there are some
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
where the budget committee is saying no
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the school board is saying yes where
 
03:40:43.870 --> 03:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
the budget committee is saying one
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
figure and the school board is saying
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
another the whole purpose of having the
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
budget committee is to provide the
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
voters with more information and as I
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
said before expertise focus and checks
 
03:40:56.479 --> 03:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
said before expertise focus and checks
and

03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:00.429 --> 03:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
balances this is just a very very weird
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
thing where you look in one part of Law
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
and it says composed exactly alike then
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
you look at this and it throws it off so
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
please I have no quibble with the role
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
of an ex
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
officio I think that ex officio brings a
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
perspective acts as a liazon facilitates
 
03:41:21.790 --> 03:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
communication that's all good but it
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that person have a
 
03:41:29.070 --> 03:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
vote the second part of the bill in uh
 
03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
the additional
 
03:41:34.269 --> 03:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
language added to uh subsection
 
03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
2 uh in lines 22 to
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
29 is basically going to one point right
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
now our statute uh 19 512a is very clear
 
03:41:54.990 --> 03:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
that the annual budget must be referred
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
to the budget
 
03:42:01.790 --> 03:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
committee and it's not so clear that the
 
03:42:04.590 --> 03:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
budget committee should have the same
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
sort of role in any other off-budget
 
03:42:10.349 --> 03:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
cycle uh new
 
03:42:13.710 --> 03:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
spending I'm not talking about decisions
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
to spend what's already been
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated I'm talking about those uh
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
instances in the year supplemental
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations some sort of an emergency
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
hearing uh or in fact the question that
 
03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
arises every two years with the state
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
aid I'll explain that in a moment um
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
every one of those
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
cases should equally have the budget
 
03:42:43.990 --> 03:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee's attention and the voters
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
should have the budget committee's
 
03:42:48.309 --> 03:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
evaluation and
 
03:42:48.319 --> 03:42:50.110 align:start position:0%
evaluation and
opinion

03:42:50.110 --> 03:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:42:53.429 --> 03:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
so here we are in a budget year and what
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
occurred two years ago uh in the Fall
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
Mountain district is that the district's
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
budget was set by the voters in
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
March the uh State's budget was set in
 
03:43:08.110 --> 03:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
June by the legislature and signed by
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
the governor and it included uh
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
increased adequacy Aid so the increased
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid is uh is defined and and
 
03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
approved and given a number after the
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
school's budget has been uh approved and
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
the school board treated that in October
 
03:43:29.469 --> 03:43:29.479 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:43:31.870 --> 03:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
windfall they bypassed the budget
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee and called a quick hearing to
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
propose that about
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
$280,000 be spent on Paving and parking
 
03:43:42.269 --> 03:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
lots and uh second uh entrance or egress
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
to the high school now whether that's a
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
good thing or not is ultimately up to
 
03:43:51.189 --> 03:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
the voters but again the voters are
 
03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be informed not just by the
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
school board's opinion but also the
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
budget committee's opinion the purpose
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
of this language is just to
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that when new Appropriations are
 
03:44:03.239 --> 03:44:04.670 align:start position:0%
ensure that when new Appropriations are
asked

03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
asked
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
for they have to go to the budget
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee and that was never meant to be
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
confined Strictly To The Once annual
 
03:44:16.229 --> 03:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
budget okay um so I hope that explains
 
03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
the bill well I I think they're pretty
 
03:44:21.070 --> 03:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory and obvious I I
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
certainly see very clear instances in my
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
own district and Community where these
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
two things make a difference and I
 
03:44:31.149 --> 03:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
imagine that uh many of you will
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
probably also relate in terms of what
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
you've seen in your own districts glad
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you uh
 
03:44:38.279 --> 03:44:39.469 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you uh
representative

03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:44:41.670 --> 03:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you thank you take my
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate the clarity of
 
03:44:45.950 --> 03:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you can you go back
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
to the second part of the expenditure
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
the the windfall yes and run it through
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
to us had this been in
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
place right so had it been in place the
 
03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
school board would have referred this
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
matter to the budget committee the
 
03:45:05.550 --> 03:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
budget committee could have met quickly
 
03:45:07.630 --> 03:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
and given their opinion before the
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing was held and so when this
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing was
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
called we have Five Towns um I think
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's probably close to 8 or 10,000
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
voters uh 2600 or so in my town and uh I
 
03:45:29.309 --> 03:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
was offered the uh call upon for the
 
03:45:32.349 --> 03:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
first question and my question is where
 
03:45:35.229 --> 03:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
does the budget committee stand on this
 
03:45:36.790 --> 03:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they said oh we haven't referred it
 
03:45:38.590 --> 03:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
to the budget committee I said and why
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
is that and we got a legal opinion from
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
The District's attorney who was sitting
 
03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
there say well the statute doesn't
 
03:45:48.750 --> 03:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly state that anything beyond
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
the annual budget has to go to the
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
budget committee and I I said right then
 
03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
and there well I think a bill needs to
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
be introduced to make that
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
clear want to follow up Mr chair yes so
 
03:46:04.950 --> 03:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
going back to the windfall under the
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
this provision had it been there so the
 
03:46:11.149 --> 03:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
the school board would have said say yes
 
03:46:12.670 --> 03:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
the budget committee would have said say
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
no and then it goes to the voters just
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
of those recommendations or to stop by
 
03:46:18.189 --> 03:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
the budget committee I'm not familiar
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
with the Cooperative School process all
 
03:46:21.790 --> 03:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
right no the budget committee s simply
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
gives an opinion they have no ability to
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
approve or disapprove okay thank you
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sure represent Sul
 
03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm looking um at
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
lines 26
 
03:46:37.439 --> 03:46:39.070 align:start position:0%
lines 26
27

03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
27
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
Etc um where it says no warrant article
 
03:46:44.149 --> 03:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
shall be printed on the annual town
 
03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
meeting ballot or special meeting ballot
 
03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
without the approval of the committee
 
03:46:51.630 --> 03:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious if there's an item for
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
example in my district they just
 
03:46:55.550 --> 03:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
approved a new teacher contract um after
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
protracted negotiations which at our um
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
deliberative session the voters approved
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
to go on to the ballot without Amendment
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
um but so in this case if the budget
 
03:47:10.349 --> 03:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
Committee disapproved of that negotiated
 
03:47:12.630 --> 03:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
contract that would that then hold it
 
03:47:15.389 --> 03:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
from being able to go
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
because you just said that it was just
 
03:47:18.510 --> 03:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
advisory it wasn't no I think you're
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
asking a very good question I'm trying
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
to understand how that's G to play
 
03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
together so I I'd like to think this
 
03:47:25.469 --> 03:47:25.479 align:start position:0%
through carefully read this carefully
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps an amendment would address what
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
you're asking so let me just clarify
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
what the intent is the intent is not
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee could prevent
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
it from going to the voters but rather
 
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
that the um it would be referred to the
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
voters with the vote not just of the
 
03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
school board but also at the budget
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee and and if we we can clarify
 
03:47:47.229 --> 03:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
that that would be great ask
 
03:47:49.950 --> 03:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you so much so you
 
03:47:53.229 --> 03:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
would say amending it to say that um the
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
warrant article shouldn't be printed on
 
03:47:59.149 --> 03:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
the on on the ballot uh without the
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
information from the committee or the
 
03:48:01.870 --> 03:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
opinion of the committee correct for
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
example corre yes yes something very
 
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
much along the lines of what you said
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
okay ref Murray thank you Mr CH thank
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
question in the same sort of uh same
 
03:48:17.670 --> 03:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
area same conversation I'm trying to
 
03:48:20.590 --> 03:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
think about what would happen in the
 
03:48:23.149 --> 03:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
event of are you asking for like the
 
03:48:25.630 --> 03:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
dispositive vote by the budget committee
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
to recommend
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
approval ex you know I'm not I'm not in
 
03:48:33.870 --> 03:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
any way requiring an approval and I
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
think this goes to representative cel's
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
question um what I'm what I would like
 
03:48:43.149 --> 03:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
this to require is that it be referred
 
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
to the budget committee budget committee
 
03:48:47.790 --> 03:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to assess it to take
 
03:48:50.670 --> 03:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
a vote and to have that vote recorded so
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
that the voters are informed of where
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
the budget committee stands is very
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
important not
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
just um you know to have a majority but
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's also very important for the voters
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
to know when something is Unified or
 
03:49:08.910 --> 03:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's divided so it may be 43 in
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
favor but I still think it's an
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
important bit of knowledge that it was
 
03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:13.469 align:start position:0%
important bit of knowledge that it was
not

03:49:13.469 --> 03:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes follow up if I may um and maybe this
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
was dealt with an election law at one
 
03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
point but I do recall there
 
03:49:28.110 --> 03:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
being conversation around uh in the
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
following lines 28 and 29 where it does
 
03:49:33.309 --> 03:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
say that the vote of the prop uh on each
 
03:49:35.070 --> 03:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
proposal shall be recorded and printed
 
03:49:36.269 --> 03:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
ballot is that in statute anywhere
 
03:49:42.510 --> 03:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
already it's not in Statute in regards
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
to Cooperative School District budget
 
03:49:44.239 --> 03:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
to Cooperative School District budget
committees

03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.199 --> 03:49:51.070 align:start position:0%
 
further

03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
questions you sure I am okay so thank
 
03:49:55.870 --> 03:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
you I'm just thinking back to the
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
previous Bill where we had a qu question
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
about electioneering based on
 
03:50:01.750 --> 03:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
information printed on a ballot and I
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this would raise the
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
same legal question I don't know if
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's a question for you or for the for
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
the sponsor or from an attorney um but
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
just where that was a question that came
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
up earlier today about could such
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
information be construed as
 
03:50:18.910 --> 03:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
electioneering um I just don't know if
 
03:50:20.110 --> 03:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
there's a legal
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
opinion my personal opinion is it would
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
not be electioneering just to have the
 
03:50:28.750 --> 03:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
vote of the any committee but um but I
 
03:50:32.189 --> 03:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
am also not a lawyer um I I would like
 
03:50:34.110 --> 03:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
to weigh in but without the benefit of
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
having heard what you were discussing
 
03:50:35.640 --> 03:50:37.510 align:start position:0%
having heard what you were discussing
earlier

03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I can't say whether this is a
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
uniform practice across the state but
 
03:50:44.910 --> 03:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a long-standing and
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
uniform practice in the Fall Mountain
 
03:50:49.229 --> 03:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
School District that the warrant article
 
03:50:49.239 --> 03:50:50.309 align:start position:0%
School District that the warrant article
does

03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
disclose uh the school board's a vote on
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
every warrant including the requisitions
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
from uh uh um Capital reserves and and
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
various other issues uh Fall Mountain
 
03:51:07.229 --> 03:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
District only voted in March
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
22 uh to establish a budget committee
 
03:51:10.239 --> 03:51:11.149 align:start position:0%
22 uh to establish a budget committee
under

03:51:11.149 --> 03:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
195 and uh so this is only the third
 
03:51:17.149 --> 03:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
budget C but the budget committee's vote
 
03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
is recorded in the warrant uh um for the
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
budget for the school teachers or staff
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
contracts etc etc it's it's just these
 
03:51:32.189 --> 03:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm aiming at here is these events
 
03:51:32.199 --> 03:51:33.269 align:start position:0%
what I'm aiming at here is these events
that

03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:36.830 --> 03:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
occur between the annual January
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
February March cycle of budget hearing
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:46.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
Boni thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question again I'm not
 
03:51:52.670 --> 03:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Cooperative District
 
03:51:54.910 --> 03:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
process um I belong to an SIU so it's a
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
little bit different so what I hear
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
you're saying is you already have the
 
03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
authority to do this during the um
 
03:52:05.189 --> 03:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
annual budget process and what this bill
 
03:52:07.550 --> 03:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
is attempting to do is to allow it to
 
03:52:10.269 --> 03:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
occur for
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
um potential funds that might come up
 
03:52:15.309 --> 03:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
during the year and those purposes but
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
two questions um is there a limit or a
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
lower threshold of you know expenditures
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
where you see that it's important for
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
the budget committee to weigh in on and
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
also um again procedure wise in a public
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
hearing it says having a ballot um
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's different for me too I don't
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
understand why you would have a ballot
 
03:52:40.670 --> 03:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
hearing no you don't have a ballot
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
taking your second question first you
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a ballot in the public
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
hearing you have a public hearing before
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
it goes to the
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
voters so I'm sorry follow so mid year
 
03:52:58.149 --> 03:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
you would have like another vote a
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
townwide vote I think the mechanics can
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
vary and how that vote is taken I don't
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
know but all this is trying to get at is
 
03:53:08.149 --> 03:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee opines before
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
the decision is
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
made I'm sorry what was your first
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.990 --> 03:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
oh the first question was on the um a
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
lower limit of you know you're talking
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
about Capital expenditures there's no um
 
03:53:24.830 --> 03:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
I mean it could be anything I mean you
 
03:53:27.630 --> 03:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a lower what what amount of
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
what you would be asking to weigh in on
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
right that's true the bill doesn't have
 
03:53:35.550 --> 03:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
a lower um yeah and and frankly if the
 
03:53:37.030 --> 03:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee thought that there was some
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
threshold over which this was meaningful
 
03:53:41.950 --> 03:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
um I would have no objection to that but
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
I would think that threshold would be
 
03:53:45.309 --> 03:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
very low
 
03:53:51.309 --> 03:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.469 --> 03:53:53.479 align:start position:0%
100 repres
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question with regard to
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
lines 24 through
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
20 it's like six and a halfish with
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
regard to the expenditures and a public
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
hearing until the budget committee has
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity for review and
 
03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation how do non-public sessions
 
03:54:16.149 --> 03:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
that are talking about all sorts of
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
things that might have an expenditure to
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
them um through various types of
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
negotiation be impacted by this
 
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
requirements I don't think they'd be
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
impacted at all I mean the 195 elsewhere
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have the citation off my uh top
 
03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
of my head is very clear in saying that
 
03:54:38.670 --> 03:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
the kind of appropriation that I
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
described uh that comes after the
 
03:54:42.990 --> 03:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
legislative budget is set and generally
 
03:54:46.269 --> 03:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
in the fall um takes a while for those
 
03:54:48.149 --> 03:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
figures even to be calculated and
 
03:54:50.830 --> 03:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
disseminated out to the district very
 
03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
clearly requires a hearing but the
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
question of the hearing is what's the
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
value of the hearing if the budget
 
03:54:59.510 --> 03:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee hasn't had a chance to
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate it and present their opinion
 
03:55:03.990 --> 03:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the hearing is to inform
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
the voting public and to allow them to
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
ask questions so that's the exact
 
03:55:12.670 --> 03:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
juncture that we were at in October uh
 
03:55:18.990 --> 03:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
bill for the questions see none uh thank
 
03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
you representative thank you very
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
Christina thank you again chairman
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh good afternoon members of
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
the committee bar Christina from the
 
03:55:44.790 --> 03:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
school boards Association I do want to
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank representative spillsbury for
 
03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
having some conversations with nhba
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
relative to this I think there are some
 
03:55:52.349 --> 03:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
areas where we might be able to reach
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
some agreement um I certainly understand
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative's position the
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury's position and
 
03:56:00.910 --> 03:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
explanation of some of these um some of
 
03:56:02.710 --> 03:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
his concerns and and and what the bill
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
says some we might agree with and some
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
some we might we might disagree with um
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with the first
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
section that removes um the school board
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
member from having a a voting um a a
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
voting right um on on the budget
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee I understand Representatives
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury's position that
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
that individual is voed twice once for
 
03:56:24.510 --> 03:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
the school board and then once on the
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee um but I suppose um
 
03:56:30.389 --> 03:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
rather and and the concerns about it
 
03:56:32.670 --> 03:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
being an even numbered body and
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
potentially for a tie vote a couple
 
03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
points on that one rather than um having
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
rather than eliminating the school board
 
03:56:43.469 --> 03:56:43.479 align:start position:0%
members vote on the budget committee um
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
I suppose because could just amend the
 
03:56:47.189 --> 03:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
statute and add an extra member of the
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
budget committee another at large
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
position so you would have an odd number
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
of people um still having the vote um
 
03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
two um uh this body may be aware that
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
from time to time public bodies um come
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
out with ti votes and then it goes to
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
the larger body without a recommendation
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
we may have seen that a couple of times
 
03:57:07.990 --> 03:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
in this in this building over the last
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
couple of years so that might that might
 
03:57:13.389 --> 03:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
be one option it goes on the the the the
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
budget or the whatever the the warrant
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
article is goes on the ballot or goes to
 
03:57:19.149 --> 03:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
the annual meeting without a
 
03:57:21.149 --> 03:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the uh from the
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee um and I guess the the
 
03:57:25.870 --> 03:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
third aspect to that is um nothing that
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
you can really put in statute but if
 
03:57:30.630 --> 03:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
there is continued disagreement among
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
the budget committee as to whether or
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
not to support or whether or not to
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
oppose the budget in my opinion the
 
03:57:38.590 --> 03:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
School Board needs to perhaps do a
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
better job explaining the budget and
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be some better
 
03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
communication between the bucom and the
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
School Board as to why the bucom wants
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
to cut or the school board wants to add
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
but I understand we can't legislate that
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to throw that out
 
03:57:53.950 --> 03:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
there that you know if we're having TI
 
03:57:55.630 --> 03:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
votes all the time or or there's
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
disagreement then perhaps the deeper
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
conversations need to be had among the
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
the bodies um at at issue um relative to
 
03:58:05.309 --> 03:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
a couple of the other things um in the
 
03:58:07.950 --> 03:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill um and that that that
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury mentioned um
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
there may need to be my my my concern
 
03:58:16.030 --> 03:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
con ER with some of with changing some
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the provisions in The Cooperative
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
School District statute and
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
1952a I believe we're we're talking
 
03:58:26.910 --> 03:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
about is that I think there are some
 
03:58:29.229 --> 03:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
Provisions in RSA 32 the municipal
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
budget statute that speak to budgets and
 
03:58:33.950 --> 03:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget committees and and
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations on warrant articles that
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
that may need to be changed to Encompass
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
all budget committees and not
 
03:58:43.469 --> 03:58:43.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily just Cooperative School
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
District budget committees for example
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
if we look at existing language I'm on
 
03:58:50.429 --> 03:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
the I guess the bill is only one page so
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill lines 19
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
through 21 such Cooperative School Board
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school budget committee
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
shall have all the powers in duties of
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
the municipal budget committee under the
 
03:59:05.550 --> 03:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 32 in so far as the
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
budget for the Cooperative school
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
district is concerned and in so far as
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 32 is applicable to Cooperative
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
school boards so one point of of uh to
 
03:59:17.309 --> 03:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
to raise I I believe there was a
 
03:59:19.149 --> 03:59:19.159 align:start position:0%
question about the notation of the
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
budget committee whether or not they
 
03:59:22.670 --> 03:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
recommend the warrant article or don't
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
recommend the warrant article this is
 
03:59:28.269 --> 03:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 32 colon 5 and again RSA 32 the
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
municipal budget statute RSA 32 colon 5
 
03:59:36.189 --> 03:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph 5 when any purpose of
 
03:59:38.429 --> 03:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation submitted by a governing
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
body the school board or by petition
 
03:59:42.990 --> 03:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
appears in the warrant as part of a
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
special warrant article the article
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
shall contain a notation of whether or
 
03:59:49.469 --> 03:59:49.479 align:start position:0%
not that appropriation is recommended by
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
the governing body and if there is a
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee a notation of whether
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
or not it is recommended by by the
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
budget committee so if we've got a
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
warrant article that calls for an
 
04:00:01.349 --> 04:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation and you have a budget
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee that budget committee is
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to to give their thumbs up or
 
04:00:06.550 --> 04:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
thumbs down and that is not notated on
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
on the warrant further along um uh I'm
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
on page I guess I'm still on lines 22
 
04:00:15.030 --> 04:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
and 23 Additionally the committee shall
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
review and evaluate any proposed warrant
 
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
articles or supplemental Appropriations
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
involving the expenditure of funds I
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
believe representative spillsbury said
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
that current law says that the bucom is
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
only responsible for overseeing the
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
general overall operating budget as I
 
04:00:34.110 --> 04:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
read through the statute this is RSA
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
32 colon 16 um the budget committee is
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for one to prepare the
 
04:00:44.349 --> 04:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
budget as provided in RSA 32 col 5 and
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
if authorized under the sb2 statute a
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
default budget um I think nhba can get
 
04:00:52.510 --> 04:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
behind the notion that if a warrant
 
04:00:54.429 --> 04:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
article is calling for an appropriation
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's the the the general
 
04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
overall operating budget or it's a
 
04:01:01.349 --> 04:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article $50,000 for the
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
playground um if the bucom wants to
 
04:01:05.830 --> 04:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that I I think I think
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's completely reasonable again that
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
might need to go in RSA 32 co15 though
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily in The Cooperative
 
04:01:16.110 --> 04:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
statute the the one um area where nhba
 
04:01:19.030 --> 04:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
would disagree with the the the the bill
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh the last aspect of line 23 and on 24
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
including withdrawals from capital
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
reserve funds not previously authorized
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
um we would disagree with the budget
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee necessarily having a say over
 
04:01:34.030 --> 04:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal from the capital reserve
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
fund the money that is put into a
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund has already been
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the voters whether or
 
04:01:42.790 --> 04:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
not that money has been raised by taxes
 
04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
or often times looking back to your own
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
districts you'll probably see that year-
 
04:01:49.870 --> 04:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
end Surplus is is put into a a capital
 
04:01:52.149 --> 04:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
reserve fund and that may be not not a
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund but any reserve
 
04:01:56.349 --> 04:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
fund that may be a capital reserve fund
 
04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
it may for special education purposes
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know if there's year on Surplus
 
04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to throw $100,000 into the
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
special education trust fund or the
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
special education trust fund so to build
 
04:02:08.429 --> 04:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
that up in case we get a high cost kid
 
04:02:10.269 --> 04:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
that moves in so that money has already
 
04:02:11.790 --> 04:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
been appropriated by the voters the
 
04:02:13.389 --> 04:02:13.399 align:start position:0%
voters have already authorized that
 
04:02:16.149 --> 04:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
money to go into that trust fund the way
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
that operates now with the how that is
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
expended is
 
04:02:27.670 --> 04:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 35 colon 15 this is the the statute
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds for of counties
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
towns districts and water departments
 
04:02:34.590 --> 04:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
persons holding set capital reserve
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
funds and Trust as provided in this
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
chapter shall hold the same until such
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
time as the town District or County
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
shall have voted to withdraw funds from
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
from such capital reserve fund or shall
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
have named the named agents of the Town
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
District or County to carry out the
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
objects designated by the town District
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
or county in a manner prescribed by RSA
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
35 col 3 now in many cases if a school
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
district has a reserve fund the school
 
04:03:05.950 --> 04:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
board is named the agent of that trust
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
authorized um by the voters to be clear
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
authorized by the voters to be the ones
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
to expend that that that trust fund
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
so if we have
 
04:03:18.870 --> 04:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
$250,000 in a special education trust
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
fund and midyear that budget looks like
 
04:03:23.149 --> 04:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to get blown for whatever
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
reasons we don't have to hold special
 
04:03:26.429 --> 04:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
hearings the school board doesn't
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to go back to the
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
voters um doesn't have to go to the
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
budget committee because the voters have
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
already authorized the school board to
 
04:03:36.030 --> 04:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
be the agent to expend that money so we
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
would disagree with the language um in
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
the in the in the bill um about
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
including withdrawals from capital
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
reserve funds we think again RSA 35
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
already authorizes whoever the agent is
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
um uh continuing on uh no such
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
expenditure may be the subject may be
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
the subject of a notice hearing or
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
meeting of the legislative body until
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
the budget committee has had an
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review and evaluate um
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
review and evaluate be mindful of that
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
language because I'm looking at
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury talked about
 
04:04:13.710 --> 04:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
um the Fall Mountain School District
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
received some extra excess adequacy Aid
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
this year there's a statute RSA 197
 
04:04:24.309 --> 04:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
3-a special meetings for changes in
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
education funding we put this Statute in
 
04:04:29.790 --> 04:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
I want to say in 2011 or so um when
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
there were some changes to the adequacy
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
formula and districts were getting more
 
04:04:34.429 --> 04:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
money they had already had annual
 
04:04:36.990 --> 04:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
meetings we weren't sure what the law
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
was at the time we meeting sort of the
 
04:04:38.640 --> 04:04:40.550 align:start position:0%
was at the time we meeting sort of the
collective

04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
collective
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
educational uh uh uh uh uh Community if
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
you will in New Hampshire about whether
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
or not we could accept that money
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not we had to have a special
 
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
a special meeting to accept the extra
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
money so this States again
 
04:04:54.840 --> 04:04:56.630 align:start position:0%
money so this States again
1973

04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
1973
 
04:04:59.309 --> 04:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
3-a it says in response to statutory
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
changes resting resulting in reductions
 
04:05:04.110 --> 04:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
or increases in distribution of State
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
revenues for Education pursuing to RSA
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
198 col 41 to school districts which
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
would take effect after the adoption of
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
the new School District budget after
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
annual meeting
 
04:05:16.149 --> 04:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
and would apply in the fiscal year
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
covered by the new budget the governing
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
body of a school district May after
 
04:05:23.149 --> 04:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
consultation with the budget committee
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
call a special meeting of the
 
04:05:26.910 --> 04:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body to consider a reduction
 
04:05:29.189 --> 04:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
recision increase of Appropriations made
 
04:05:30.750 --> 04:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
at the annual meeting so in that
 
04:05:32.349 --> 04:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance the budget committee has to
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
be I guess just notified but the budget
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee does not um have a vote or a
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
say or make a recommendation whether or
 
04:05:43.469 --> 04:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
not that excess adequacy Aid or or what
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
to to do with it give it back to the
 
04:05:47.309 --> 04:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers put up a new roof put in an
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
HVAC system whatever the case may be so
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you know again there may be there may
 
04:05:55.389 --> 04:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
be a change in in a different statute
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
beyond what is being presented today um
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
if if if there's excess you know nhsp
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an opinion on whether or
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
not that excess a should go to the bucom
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
for a vote um I I guess just without
 
04:06:10.349 --> 04:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
thinking it through I think we'd be
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
pretty neutral on that um but
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect with I'll skip that
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
um anyway so I I think that's going to
 
04:06:27.269 --> 04:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
wrap up wrap up my my testimony um you
 
04:06:29.229 --> 04:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
know some of the some some of the things
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
again nsba can certainly get behind um
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any appropriation
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
that or if there's any warrant article
 
04:06:36.149 --> 04:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
that calls for an appropriation Beyond
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
just the budget if the bucom wants to
 
04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
review that make a recommendation I
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
don't think nsba would have a specific
 
04:06:43.710 --> 04:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
objection to that but I think that's
 
04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
more an RSA
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
32 um uh issue the municipal budget um
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
law rather than a Cooperative School
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
District so um representative spillsbury
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
and I have had some some conversations
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
um if you want to work together sir we
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
can we can certainly try and do that um
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
so um I think I think that's my
 
04:07:04.510 --> 04:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and I hope I was clear I know
 
04:07:06.110 --> 04:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
we've got sort of a shotgun approach
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of statutes that are being
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
impacted here but I think more of these
 
04:07:11.790 --> 04:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
again relate to sort of the overall
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
budgeting process rather than are
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily specific to Cooperative
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
school districts and with that I will
 
04:07:19.389 --> 04:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions but I give
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
you no
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
guarantees thank you thank you uh
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative Murray why don't you give
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
give it a
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
try thank you Mr chair um I I do have a
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
question with and I just want to make
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure I'm understanding your comment with
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
regard to 197 uh 3A yeah it is my
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
recollection in past in in various you
 
04:07:39.319 --> 04:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
recollection in past in in various you
know

04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
um in the in the towns that I represent
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
um there have been circumstances where
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
special meetings were called and it was
 
04:07:48.510 --> 04:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
the am I understanding correctly it is
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
the vote of the body present to decide
 
04:07:52.269 --> 04:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not to return those funds
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers uh thank you for
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
the question representative yes I
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
believe it is I the school board so I
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
um special meeting the governing the
 
04:08:08.710 --> 04:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
governing this is RSA 197
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
3-a paragraph 3 the governing B's
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
warrant shall specify in one or more
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
articles the amounts of Appropriations
 
04:08:17.870 --> 04:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
proposed for reduction recision or
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
increase from the operating budget or
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
separate more articles or both adopted
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the annual
 
04:08:23.520 --> 04:08:25.429 align:start position:0%
at the annual
meeting

04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
um so if the school board wants to
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
expend that money they need to have a
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
purpose for whether or not it's just
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
added to your general budget um you know
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
or or or presumably this I think the I
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
think the governing body I think the
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
school board has the if the voters
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
authorize the appropriation I think the
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
governing body has Authority on how it's
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to be expended whether or not
 
04:08:50.070 --> 04:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's again included in your general
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
operating budget for cost that you know
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
maybe on unanticipated cost or the or
 
04:08:57.870 --> 04:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
the governing body certainly has the
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
authority to return it to the taxpayers
 
04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year to reduce taxes
 
04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
for the following year I believe that
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
power rest with the governing body
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
though represent s thank you very quick
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
question um I wasn't entirely clear
 
04:09:15.149 --> 04:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
whether you objected to the school board
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
member who's sitting on the budget
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
committee having being there without the
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
ability to vote I I couldn't quite
 
04:09:24.910 --> 04:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
decide yeah certainly so I I I I mean
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
representing School boards I'm going to
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
say that individual should have a vote I
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
certainly I certainly understand
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury's rationale for
 
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
for for the changes in the in the bill
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
yeah president Murray thank you Mr chair
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question my
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
other question is with regard to that as
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
well are there other circumstances where
 
04:09:47.710 --> 04:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
other types of EX official members sit
 
04:09:51.389 --> 04:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
on school boards that are you know not
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
within a budget committee or not within
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
a I
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
think don't quote me on this I think
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
there may be somewhere in statute or
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
rules where the superintendent is deemed
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
an ex official member that may be in
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
rules and if I can find it in the
 
04:10:09.309 --> 04:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
interum and I catch you during a break
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
or something I I can clarify that but in
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
terms of statutory
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing is coming to mind in
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
terms of in terms of Statute
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you yeah thank
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
you would you have any idea how many
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
Cooperative uh districts have a budget
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the question I
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
don't know that representa we know that
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
there are 32 co-ops across the state um
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the Dr has that or or
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
just it's not something that we've trct
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
curious yeah
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
yeah see no further questions thank you
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
much was there yes representative
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
spilsbury yes return trip to the uh
 
04:10:54.000 --> 04:10:55.670 align:start position:0%
spilsbury yes return trip to the uh
witness

04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
witness
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh I'm not coming back
 
04:11:00.750 --> 04:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
to rut and and and turn and turn this
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
into a debate but just simply to clarify
 
04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
two things uh number one I would
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
encourage you on in regard to the uh ex
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
officio voting or non- voting capacity
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
not to further distort or complicate the
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill by adding yet another member which
 
04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
takes it further away from being
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
balanced in the same fashion as a school
 
04:11:25.149 --> 04:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
board so I would suggest that you do
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
what the bill proposes uh regarding the
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh the budget committee's role I think
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
the reference to RSA 32 is important and
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
I having been on the town's finance
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee I understand RSA 32 very well
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of complication
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
between the way 195 interrelates but I
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
think the problem is introduced right
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
here in the text of 1952a if you look at
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
the existing statutory language in lines
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
19 to
 
04:12:03.109 --> 04:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
21 says such Cooperative school budget
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
committee shall have the powers and
 
04:12:06.109 --> 04:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
duties of the municipal budget committee
 
04:12:09.070 --> 04:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of RSA 32 it
 
04:12:11.109 --> 04:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop there with a
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
period it then says in so far as the
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
budget for the Cooperative school
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
district is concerned and that's
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
precisely the language that the attorney
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
for the school district pointed to in
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
arguing that uh nothing outside of the
 
04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
budget should be referred to the budget
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee so I'll just leave it at that
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
I think that the statute is in fact
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
problematic it needs a solution and I
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
would be very happy to work with Mr
 
04:12:37.950 --> 04:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
Christina to offer you some language
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
that address the questions I think good
 
04:12:45.269 --> 04:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:47.710 --> 04:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
um see no further questions thank you
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
and um yeah we look forward to uh to
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
getting a resolution for this is you
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
know this is really held over from uh
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
last term so uh I I think there is uh is
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.109 --> 04:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
this and our
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
next hearing is about a minute
 
04:13:14.279 --> 04:13:30.910 align:start position:0%
next hearing is about a minute
away

04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.070 --> 04:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah right sticking in one BS in the
 
04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
peek or something so I remember yeah
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
maybe I can find a flag sticker or
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.040 --> 04:14:42.030 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.040 --> 04:15:11.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.960 --> 04:15:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:41.920 --> 04:16:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
is not a new bill to the house in fact
 
04:17:10.510 --> 04:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's been introduced to the house
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
before as House Bill 56
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
3 very close in number that was a couple
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
of years ago the same concept was
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate in Senate Bill
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
155 it was passed by the Senate but
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
later uh killed by the
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
house what this bill does is it requires
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
that the SAU budget be separated from
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
the School District
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
budget and placed on the ballot
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that the voters can vote separately
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
on the SAU
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
budget why is this a good
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
idea frequently such as in my town of
 
04:17:56.640 --> 04:17:59.269 align:start position:0%
idea frequently such as in my town of
eping

04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
sau14 the administrative costs of
 
04:18:04.469 --> 04:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
running the SAU are buried in the School
 
04:18:07.070 --> 04:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
District budget and it's virtually
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
impossible for the average person to dig
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
through that budget and find the line
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
SAU it would be extremely helpful to the
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
voters for transparency purposes to be
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
able to say okay this is an
 
04:18:31.030 --> 04:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
administrative cost versus this cost
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
students now I know the role of the SAU
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
is to provide services for the education
 
04:18:44.189 --> 04:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
of our students administrative
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
services but increasingly over the last
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
10 years those Services have grown to
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
include more than just Educational
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
Services and it would be useful for
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
voters to be able to see that and make a
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves about whether
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted those services or not after
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
all it's the voters money taxpayers
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
money they ought to be able to to choose
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
money so this
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation will give voters that
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity now I know that last year
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
the house passed and the governor signed
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
into law a provision that says that SAU
 
04:19:33.109 --> 04:19:33.119 align:start position:0%
budgets do have to be broken out
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
separately and displayed prominently on
 
04:19:40.149 --> 04:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
the SAU
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
website but that law doesn't take effect
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
until July 1st of
 
04:19:49.630 --> 04:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
2024 uh 2025 rather so those of us who
 
04:19:51.309 --> 04:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
are trying to make sense of our current
 
04:19:54.670 --> 04:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
school budget still don't have the
 
04:19:58.109 --> 04:19:58.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see the separate SAU
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.309 --> 04:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
costs in addition the law passed last
 
04:20:09.429 --> 04:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
year while it
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
requires the breakout of the
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
administrative cost and the display of
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
those costs on the SAU website it
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow the voters to vote
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
separately on that SAU
 
04:20:25.870 --> 04:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
budget hence the need for House Bill
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
564 to allow the voters the opportunity
 
04:20:34.510 --> 04:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
budget now because I'm suggesting that
 
04:20:39.389 --> 04:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
voters deserve this
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote separately on the
 
04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
SAU budget doesn't mean that I believe
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
that saus are not spending money wisely
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
or that they are uh providing services
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
that people don't
 
04:20:58.750 --> 04:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
want I'm not suggesting that at all the
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
SAU in my town SAU 14 I think does a
 
04:21:04.750 --> 04:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
great job uh I know several of the
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
people who work in the SAU office and I
 
04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh interact with them frequently they're
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
all good people working hard and and
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
doing a good
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
job nevertheless I still think voters
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
ought to have a
 
04:21:22.830 --> 04:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
choice are there some administrative
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
services that we want that we're not
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
getting are there some administrative
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
services that we are getting that maybe
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
we don't want voters should have that
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
choice I
 
04:21:37.630 --> 04:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
believe so that's why I've introduced
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:21:44.349 --> 04:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
564 hopefully third time times a charm
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh this time this proposal
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
will will be able to to move
 
04:21:53.189 --> 04:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
forward I'm not going to talk too much
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
more about that I think I've laid out
 
04:21:58.229 --> 04:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
the case for this bill uh I'd be happy
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
to answer questions but I will
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
preface that by saying that I am no e
 
04:22:05.950 --> 04:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
expert on
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
education uh the education statutes I'll
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
do the best I J best I can to answer
 
04:22:16.149 --> 04:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
questions but uh if I come up short it's
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm more of an expert about
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
energy than I am about
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
education so thank you and happy to
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
answer questions thank you uh
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative U
 
04:22:29.469 --> 04:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
question first thank you so much for
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward um this has been
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
actually a complaint that I've heard
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
many times in our district you don't
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
have a say on the SAU budget my question
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
is could we get um the reader digest
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
version of why HP
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
563 did not pass the house and why
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 155 was killed in the house
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.590 --> 04:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
that I was not involved with either of
 
04:23:06.189 --> 04:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
those bills so I'm not entirely
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
certain I was it was explained to me
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
that in one of those two bills and I
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't remember which one there was some
 
04:23:17.309 --> 04:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
difficulty about how to handle saus that
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
had more than one school district in
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
them so this bill addresses that issue
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
it clearly describes a process for um
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with multi-district saus versus
 
04:23:34.189 --> 04:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
single District saus it's spelled out in
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill I hope that
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
answered the
 
04:23:40.349 --> 04:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
SEL thank you um and thank you for
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question and it may be that
 
04:23:46.510 --> 04:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's a question that Mr Christina is
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
more able to answer but wouldn't the
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
voters be able by attending budget
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
hearings budget information sessions the
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
um deliberative session and so on be
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
able to know and ask question not at the
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
deliberative session but at the previous
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
budget hearings and whatnot be able to
 
04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
ask all of the questions and get the
 
04:24:07.870 --> 04:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
information so that should they wish to
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
make an amendment to the budget they
 
04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
could do that at their deliberative
 
04:24:12.670 --> 04:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
sessions already isn't that the way
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
their system already
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
Works yes I'm sure that voters could do
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the problem is very few voters
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
choose to do that
 
04:24:28.990 --> 04:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
and there ought to be a way that voters
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
on their own time and under their own
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances can get that information
 
04:24:37.109 --> 04:24:37.119 align:start position:0%
right now they can't do that it's it's
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
buried in the line items of the budget
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
which may be in a spreadsheet on the SA
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
website but it's very hard to for a
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
single voter to figure out what's what
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
in that spreadsheet so it would be great
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
if every voter had the the time the
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
energy the wherewithal to attend all
 
04:25:01.149 --> 04:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
these budget hearings but the reality is
 
04:25:03.790 --> 04:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
not very many people do ask a follow up
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
please follow up and where you
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
referenced um that there's a bill that
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
was passed last year that goes into
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
effect this coming
 
04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
summer even Even If This Were to go on
 
04:25:16.710 --> 04:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
warp speed and be on next week like if
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
we were to vote on it today and get it
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
onto next week's calendar which I don't
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
think it's even possible um and then go
 
04:25:26.149 --> 04:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
I don't like how is this going to
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
possibly be in effect prior to the bill
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
for next year so it would impact the
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
vote on March
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
11th it wouldn't have any impact on this
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
year's voting certainly for example my
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
deliberative session is tomorrow night
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't have any impact on this
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
year's voting but the main
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
distinction between this bill and the
 
04:25:50.590 --> 04:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
existing statute is that this bill would
 
04:25:53.229 --> 04:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
allow future voters not this year but
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe in 2026 to vote on the SAU
 
04:25:59.070 --> 04:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
budget not just look at it but vote on
 
04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
it as well representative Dr thank you
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
question um as a representative for a
 
04:26:07.870 --> 04:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
couple of districts that are single
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
school saus I just want to ask you about
 
04:26:14.269 --> 04:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
the placement of commas in the word or
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
on line 24 and
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
25 so which page page
 
04:26:23.790 --> 04:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
one yeah okay at a meeting held before
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
January 1 the school administrative unit
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
board or school board for single
 
04:26:29.550 --> 04:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
District school administrative
 
04:26:32.429 --> 04:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
units shall adopt a budget so are you
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
saying that if I am a single District
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit the school
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
board does that or do you say the school
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
administrative board or the school board
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.830 --> 04:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
school well my school district and
 
04:26:53.710 --> 04:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
school AD school administrative unit SAU
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I just I to keep from fumbling
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
the words um are the are the same same
 
04:27:04.590 --> 04:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
single district and so the school board
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
conducts all of
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Administrative Hearings on the
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
budget uh so
 
04:27:20.429 --> 04:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
be you're questioning whether the comma
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
after unit board is correct or not yes
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
does that phrase or school board for
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
single digit that means then just the
 
04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
school board for the single District
 
04:27:38.349 --> 04:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
saus not the choice between
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
administrative SAU or Schoolboard as far
 
04:27:44.189 --> 04:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
as I know in my town we don't have a
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
separate board for the SAU we just have
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
a school
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
board yeah I think we do too
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay fair enough thank you R
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
Mur thank you um Mr chair and thank you
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I do have a
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
question with regard to um the Secretary
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
of State's political calendar and
 
04:28:08.309 --> 04:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
Alternate town meeting days you seem to
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
indicate that this would not
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
impact any districts but there are
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
districts in which alternate town
 
04:28:18.269 --> 04:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
meeting days do exist and they use them
 
04:28:18.279 --> 04:28:19.670 align:start position:0%
meeting days do exist and they use them
so

04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
how is that are you aware of that I
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
guess that if you're asking for 60 days
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
after passage there's quite possible
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
that this could affect districts this
 
04:28:34.109 --> 04:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
year well I suppose that's possible
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
though although I will have to admit
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
that I find that uh improbable Since By
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
the time this legislation Works its way
 
04:28:44.229 --> 04:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:28:47.590 --> 04:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
process um should it succeed in the
 
04:28:50.109 --> 04:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate I would think it
 
04:28:53.670 --> 04:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be July or August before it got to
 
04:28:56.830 --> 04:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's desk and if the governor
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
assigned it
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
then it wouldn't take effect for 60 days
 
04:29:04.510 --> 04:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
so it might take effect in October I
 
04:29:08.109 --> 04:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
don't know of any towns that delay
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
their uh their town meeting activity
 
04:29:14.189 --> 04:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
until October maybe there are some but
 
04:29:16.510 --> 04:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
none that I'm aware
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
of thank you rep Woodcock thank you CH
 
04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you for testifying um just
 
04:29:28.349 --> 04:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
for Layman Clarity here in your District
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
um with seu in a single building like uh
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
Margaret so the budget would show the
 
04:29:38.109 --> 04:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
SAU cost of the separate entity and then
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
the other school cost of this other
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
separate entity and this what make I'm
 
04:29:42.269 --> 04:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
trying to decide from which what you
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
said and in my school district where
 
04:29:48.510 --> 04:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
there is seu over say seven towns there'
 
04:29:50.950 --> 04:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
be one seu cost and then that each
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
individual seven towns is that how that
 
04:29:52.640 --> 04:29:53.309 align:start position:0%
individual seven towns is that how that
would

04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
look how is that how you fact is that
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
04:30:00.269 --> 04:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
saying I believe so yes uh the cost
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
would be a portioned according to the
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
formula in the legislation for each of
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
the seven towns okay uh but the overall
 
04:30:14.670 --> 04:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
would be singled out and then the cost
 
04:30:18.750 --> 04:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
would be proportioned within the
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
individual schools okay I believe that's
 
04:30:23.469 --> 04:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
the way it would work uh I could be
 
04:30:25.229 --> 04:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
wrong there are probably other folks who
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
could oh that's okay I just trying to
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
get that
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
picture one more okay thank you so same
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
extent than going back to your town
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
marg's town so in your one bill one
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
warant out the thing that comes for the
 
04:30:40.750 --> 04:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
voters there be two costs one this is
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
what it cost the the the community to
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
run the schools administratively this is
 
04:30:46.990 --> 04:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
what it cost for
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
programming the way the bill is light
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
laid out basically default back to the
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
year before there would be two different
 
04:30:56.510 --> 04:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
budgets the the SAU budget and then the
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
school budget right and if either failed
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
then they would fall back to the default
 
04:31:04.670 --> 04:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
budget for the previous year okay so the
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
first year that this law took effect
 
04:31:09.870 --> 04:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a presumably no default
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
SAU budget to fall back on okay um so I
 
04:31:15.479 --> 04:31:17.630 align:start position:0%
SAU budget to fall back on okay um so I
suspect

04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
04:31:21.389 --> 04:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
the the budget if it fails still takes
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
effect because there would be nothing to
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
fall back on okay unless it fell back on
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
the previous year school budget in which
 
04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
the SAU line items are buried that that
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
also likely could happen Okay thank
 
04:31:37.109 --> 04:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair president
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so a a lot this
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
with the single District seu if I
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly you are asking
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
that all the superintendent duties in uh
 
04:31:54.319 --> 04:31:55.710 align:start position:0%
that all the superintendent duties in uh
RSA

04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
194c SE be separated out you know any of
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
those superintendent duties would be
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
considered SAU duties in a single
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
District yes the way the the legislation
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
is worded and this is already an
 
04:32:15.070 --> 04:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
existing uh law it says that the
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
expenses of the school administrative
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
unit may include the salary and expenses
 
04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
of Supervisors of health phys physical
 
04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
education music art and guidance and any
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
other employees and and shall include
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
the necessary expense necessary the
 
04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
expenses necessary for the operation of
 
04:32:35.070 --> 04:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
the school administrative unit
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent assistant superintendents
 
04:32:39.630 --> 04:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
business administrators teacher
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
consultants and the regularly employed
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
office Personnel of the school admin
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
administrative unit shall be deemed
 
04:32:49.870 --> 04:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
employees of the school administrative
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
unit followup yes um so that's confusing
 
04:32:56.510 --> 04:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
to me because there are some Personnel
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
um uh duties that kind of overlap I mean
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
there are say special education
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
administrators that also have case lows
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
that also I mean I don't understand how
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
you can effectively separate it out and
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
say this is how much time I spend doing
 
04:33:16.510 --> 04:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
this and this is how much time I spend
 
04:33:18.310 --> 04:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
doing that do you does that make any
 
04:33:20.590 --> 04:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
sense that does make sense but
 
04:33:22.750 --> 04:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
apparently the SAU employees can figure
 
04:33:24.269 --> 04:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
this out because every year the
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education requires them to
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
file a form E10 which uh lists all the
 
04:33:30.879 --> 04:33:32.750 align:start position:0%
file a form E10 which uh lists all the
SAU

04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
employees so that the part the
 
04:33:37.709 --> 04:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
department is aware of them so they must
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out how to how to do
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
that since they have to figure fill out
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
E10 represent Marie thank you Mr chair
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question is
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
it your assumption the way the bill is
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
written that you could essentially have
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
a default budget for the SAU and a
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
default budget then for the academic
 
04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
portion of
 
04:34:00.439 --> 04:34:08.070 align:start position:0%
portion of
learning

04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair just I'm I'm
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
still a little confused with them so if
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
to that last question so you have a
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
multi-district um seu and you have four
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
towns voting and my Town's budget
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
presumes that the seu budget is and and
 
04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
it is one thing and that's included in
 
04:34:31.230 --> 04:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
my Town's budget and that's what I'm
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
voting on but then I'm separate you're
 
04:34:36.551 --> 04:34:36.561 align:start position:0%
separating out the SAU budget which is
 
04:34:38.990 --> 04:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
assuming those figures as well and each
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
of those four towns is assuming whatever
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
that proportional amount is um and
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
say if the seu budget fails but it
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
passes in four
 
04:34:55.230 --> 04:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
towns I mean or three of the four towns
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how that all would
 
04:35:05.230 --> 04:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
budgets I believe that is spelled out
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
referenced by this
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislation like most legislation that
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
we all have to cope with and figure out
 
04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
you read a bill like this and it refers
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
to all kinds of other legislation that's
 
04:35:33.160 --> 04:35:33.949 align:start position:0%
to all kinds of other legislation that's
in

04:35:33.949 --> 04:35:33.959 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:35:38.349 --> 04:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
existence and trying to remember what
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
each piece of those referenced leg
 
04:35:44.590 --> 04:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
legislation refers to is is difficult
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
but that is spelled out I read it
 
04:35:47.279 --> 04:35:48.990 align:start position:0%
but that is spelled out I read it
somewhere

04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.869 --> 04:35:57.879 align:start position:0%
work any
 
04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
further questions uh someone else might
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
have some uh feedback on that question
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative if I figure it out I'll
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you very much
 
04:36:10.959 --> 04:36:15.189 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you very much
representative

04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh next we have Scott
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
Goffstown hi everyone my name is Scott
 
04:36:39.789 --> 04:36:39.799 align:start position:0%
Grose and I'm from gtown New Hampshire
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
I'm the business administrator for 9
 
04:36:45.789 --> 04:36:45.799 align:start position:0%
which represents cstown and New Boston
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I did have an opportunity I I don't
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
know what the prior versions of this
 
04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%
bill was uh were but I did take a look
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
um at the bill 564 and there's just a
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
lot of questions more questions than
 
04:37:04.189 --> 04:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
answers um I'm also someone who serves
 
04:37:06.189 --> 04:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
as an election official in my town so
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just try to hit on a couple
 
04:37:11.551 --> 04:37:11.561 align:start position:0%
of issues that I find really confusing
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
as somebody who might have to administer
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
this and both as a business
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
administrator but also somebody who was
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
an election official so the first one
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to share is I do belong to
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
a multi-district so we have two um in
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
the SAU and so for us there is an SAU
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
budget that SAU budget is set by a
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
combined SAU Board of both gtown and New
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
Boston and in that situation because gof
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
toown is a much bigger Town than new
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
Boston um they must have what's called a
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
weighted vote which means that and they
 
04:37:49.629 --> 04:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
also pay a whole lot more towards the sa
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment than these other districts
 
04:37:56.830 --> 04:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
so this past year gtown paid 78% of that
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
SAU budget and New Boston paid
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
22 when you read through this piece of
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
legislation it talks about how the
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
majority of people who vote on these two
 
04:38:09.390 --> 04:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
separate warrant articles would
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not that SAU budget
 
04:38:14.910 --> 04:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
passes or fails so like I said before
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
78% gown 22% New Boston I I have the um
 
04:38:22.269 --> 04:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
I pulled up a couple of town reports
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
this is from 2023 not last year but
 
04:38:27.390 --> 04:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
interestingly in
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
2023 um there were
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
19113 people who voted in gtown for the
 
04:38:36.429 --> 04:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
on the school budget and this one
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
surprised me in New Boston
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
1763 even though Gan is a much larger
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
town so in that example goof toown
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
voters would have represented
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
52% uh of all of the voters uh that
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
particular uh voting uh Year New Boston
 
04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
48 my point that I'm trying to make here
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
is that um gtown has this weighted vote
 
04:39:00.750 --> 04:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
so if they wanted a certain budget or
 
04:39:02.429 --> 04:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to defeat a certain budget they
 
04:39:04.109 --> 04:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
could do that by asking for a weighted
 
04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
vote um in 20 some odd years of living
 
04:39:07.750 --> 04:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the community I think it happened
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
once um in but in the way this is set up
 
04:39:13.709 --> 04:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
new Boston as a town would get a lot
 
04:39:16.429 --> 04:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
more power um and if you had whether it
 
04:39:19.070 --> 04:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
be a conservative town or a liberal Town
 
04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
certainly the majority in this case uh G
 
04:39:25.390 --> 04:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
almost 80% uh loses quite you know could
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
lose out you know quite a bit in that in
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
that situation I wanted to also talk
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
about on page three uh it talks about
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
how ballots would be uh collected and
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
one thing that I'm super confused on is
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
that it appears as the way that this is
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
written for what I would call
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting um both New
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
Boston and gtown are s SP2 towns um so
 
04:39:48.910 --> 04:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really talk about
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions or or anything
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
like that um but as someone who's an
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
elected official the one thing that got
 
04:39:57.510 --> 04:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
me super nervous on this one is it talks
 
04:40:01.150 --> 04:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
about how the secretary uh has to retain
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
the ballots and things being transported
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
I can tell you as an elected official
 
04:40:10.030 --> 04:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
when we have paper ballots that are
 
04:40:12.510 --> 04:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
going from one in gtown we have two
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
polling locations um one is in
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
Pinardville one is in gtown high school
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have the police department has to
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are the custodians
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
of those ballots at the end of the night
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
um I used to be a select board member as
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
well we had to sign off on after we seal
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
them with red tape I mean it's some
 
04:40:34.590 --> 04:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
serious stuff this I don't know how you
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
separate like the ballot uh from a
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
recount so it's super uh you know super
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
confusing uh in in that case um as
 
04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who I might be in the minority
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
of people who work in this education
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
business I really do think that there
 
04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
are inefficiencies in state government
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
in education um and but this I think
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
exacerbates that I I think it makes it a
 
04:41:04.030 --> 04:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
situation more inefficient I believe
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we elect folks like you to do a job
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
and I hope and trust that you will do a
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
good job on bills and on budgets Etc we
 
04:41:14.550 --> 04:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
also elect local Schoolboard members who
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
serve their community and then in this
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
case they serve on a multi-district SAU
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
um if the communities do not like what
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
the SAU budget is they will then vote
 
04:41:26.830 --> 04:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
those people out and I've seen that in
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
both of our towns where you know people
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
thought that the spending was too
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
liberal they they uh brought on more
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
conservative candidates it just it it it
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
just it's the natural um you know cycle
 
04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
of things I do want to uh think that
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're some sometimes we create laws
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
that uh to solve a problem that may be
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
either doesn't exist or can be fixed
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
pretty easily so I totally understand
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
what representative BOS was mentioning
 
04:41:57.310 --> 04:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
but you can create certain codes within
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
your budget to determine even if you're
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
a single District okay this is for a
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent service this is for the
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
business part of the superintendent
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's ways to create a code if you
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
want to know what those amounts are and
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
to question those and with spreadsheets
 
04:42:14.510 --> 04:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
and pivot tables and you you can slice
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
and dice the data you can ask all those
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions so um I do believe that there
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
are opportunities all across the board
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
with public hearings deliberative
 
04:42:26.110 --> 04:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
sessions voting represent uh school
 
04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
board members in and out in our town we
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
also have budget committees Finance
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
committees there's there's a lot of
 
04:42:35.310 --> 04:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
checks and balances I I just think that
 
04:42:38.270 --> 04:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
this particular bill um is is super
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
problematic also it isolates
 
04:42:43.510 --> 04:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know one component of administration
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
I would argue in one of my communities
 
04:42:46.910 --> 04:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
we spend more money on student
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
transportation than we do on
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
Administration but yet we don't put that
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
out to the voters so the um I understand
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons for this but I would
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
I would hope that there are other ways
 
04:43:00.510 --> 04:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
of kind of solving that and I am
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
available to any one of you or any
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative for ideas on how to help
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
you get what you want but just not do it
 
04:43:09.150 --> 04:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
in a way that I think makes it a whole
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
lot more inefficient
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for being
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative litfield thank
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
my question so oftentimes I've heard
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
frustration because the Schoolboard
 
04:43:29.230 --> 04:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
members the let's say The Joint Board of
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
the co-op they'll come together and
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
they'll vote on this SAU budget right
 
04:43:35.390 --> 04:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
which I know you mentioned we can vote
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
these people out um then these weighted
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
amounts are passed on to the towns and
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
the towns feel as though they have no
 
04:43:45.270 --> 04:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
actual say what can we do outside of
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
having some kind of a special election
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
just for an SAU budget to actually give
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
voters a say on that particular
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
amount uh well for one I'm not familiar
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
you you appear to be in a community that
 
04:44:00.190 --> 04:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
has a co-op and I I'm not as part of a
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
co-op ours is what's called an area
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
agreement and um there are as part of
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
that agreement it it it's kind of spells
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
out how things are um are handled but
 
04:44:10.680 --> 04:44:11.910 align:start position:0%
out how things are um are handled but
ENT

04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
ENT
 
04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
it is the represent representative form
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
of government just like it is here where
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh those things are debated I will tell
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
you that there are public hearings there
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
are discussions um about how much money
 
04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
is spent on um superintendent salary my
 
04:44:31.628 --> 04:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
salary they're published um I think
 
04:44:34.230 --> 04:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
those are very very important to shed
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
light on the cost of administration and
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of of everything that we do um
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
so I do think think that um as it is
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes cumbersome to publish you know
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
certain data Etc I think that is an
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
effective checks and balance more so
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
than anything else to to highlight what
 
04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
people like myself make in terms of the
 
04:44:57.230 --> 04:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
contributions that we make to a certain
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
school districts I think that would be a
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
help thank
 
04:45:04.190 --> 04:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
you anything further see none thank you
 
04:45:06.560 --> 04:45:06.570 align:start position:0%

04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman Cordell members
 
04:45:23.110 --> 04:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee bar Christina schoolb
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
Association we are opposed to House Bill
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
564 um I I appreciate um the prime
 
04:45:32.110 --> 04:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor sort of explanation of the bill
 
04:45:33.868 --> 04:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
because I was thoroughly confused trying
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
to read through this I mean the simplest
 
04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
way to put it is that a single District
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
SAU does not have a separate SAU
 
04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
operating budget they they don't in a in
 
04:45:44.910 --> 04:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
a multi-district sa you're having
 
04:45:47.788 --> 04:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
multiple Towns come together to form one
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit that provides
 
04:45:52.230 --> 04:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
central office services superintendent
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
Services special ed services business
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
manager Services perhaps transportation
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
services there may be some others for
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
multiple school districts um I mean
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
could a could a a single District
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
SAU carve out it its budget so it's
 
04:46:12.750 --> 04:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
clear that these are the administrative
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
services and these are the special ed
 
04:46:15.550 --> 04:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
services and these are the
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
transportation costs I suppose they
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
could I I I mean I I'm not familiar with
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
the budgeting software that districts
 
04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
use I know that there are multiple
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:46:28.510 --> 04:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
codes that that break that that break
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
that down that are I presume reported to
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education or the
 
04:46:34.750 --> 04:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
depart Department of of Revenue
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
Administration um so that's that's
 
04:46:39.430 --> 04:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's I mean to One Challenge the other
 
04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
aspect too
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't include it it includes
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
the reference in RSA
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
194 um C that talks about um single C3
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
page one lines 17 through 18 single
 
04:46:55.230 --> 04:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
District saus shall be considered the
 
04:46:58.270 --> 04:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
same as uh single District single school
 
04:46:59.708 --> 04:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
districts and be exempt from the
 
04:47:01.470 --> 04:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of this chapter there's a
 
04:47:04.590 --> 04:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
similar similar provision on RSA 194
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
that reaffirms that as provided in RSA
 
04:47:09.990 --> 04:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
194 C3 single District school interative
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
unit shall be considered the same as a
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
single School District um you know so I
 
04:47:16.840 --> 04:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
single School District um you know so I
just

04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I guess the other concern with that is
 
04:47:25.150 --> 04:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
that um I'm on page one still that at a
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
meeting held before January
 
04:47:29.948 --> 04:47:29.958 align:start position:0%
1 the school administrative unit or
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
School Board of a single District SAU
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
shall adopt a budget required for the
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
expenses of the SAU for the next FIS
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
schal year the reason that that date is
 
04:47:41.788 --> 04:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
January 1st is because school districts
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're a single District
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
se but individual school districts are
 
04:47:47.788 --> 04:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
having their budget hearings in the
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
middle of January so you need to know
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
what your SAU this the district needs to
 
04:47:55.350 --> 04:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
know what its SAU costs are going to be
 
04:47:56.590 --> 04:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
when it's putting together its own
 
04:47:59.350 --> 04:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
District budget um that's why there's
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
the that date is January 1st and from my
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
experience most boards are getting those
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
SAU costs wrapped up in in in in the
 
04:48:08.910 --> 04:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
fall because the districts the
 
04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
constituent districts of the SAU have to
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
work through their budget um the other
 
04:48:16.350 --> 04:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
aspect too is um we already have a
 
04:48:18.430 --> 04:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
provision in law this bill would would
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
seek to eliminate the alternative budget
 
04:48:24.910 --> 04:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
um alternative SAU budget procedures in
 
04:48:30.350 --> 04:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 194 CA and C9 um if the voters of an
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
individual town want to separately vote
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
for their SAU budget and not have it
 
04:48:37.628 --> 04:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
included in their General operating
 
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
budget there's a provision where that
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
SAU budget can go is a separate warrant
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
article and if it's voted down it's
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
almost like a default budget the the
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
same cost that that District paid last
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
year to the SAU is what carries forward
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
for the for the next for the next school
 
04:48:54.788 --> 04:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
year so um I think Mr gross um you know
 
04:48:56.350 --> 04:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
because he's sort of in in in the thick
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
of this and the budgeting aspect said it
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
much better than I but I I think this is
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
just going to cause confusion um we
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
talked about the bill um earlier um that
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
goes into effect on July 1 2025 where
 
04:49:09.628 --> 04:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
school districts are going to have to
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
publish on their website all the
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
administrator salaries and everything I
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
think that and that and that applies to
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
every school dist our that's they use or
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
not so I think the information is going
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be available to to the voters and
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
what the administrative costs are
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that there's a rational way to
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
to to to figure those out but um I'll
 
04:49:28.628 --> 04:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
stop there and and again nhsp has
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
opposed but we have a lot more questions
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
um moving forward and we we think that
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
we think it's very
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
confusing thank you very much uh
 
04:49:41.948 --> 04:49:41.958 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Christina
 
04:49:44.470 --> 04:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.830 --> 04:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the uh House
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
Education policy committee my name is
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
Eric power um from Brookline New
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I'm a former School Board
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
member in the hollbrook Lan Co-operative
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
School District I'm also the president
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
of the school district governance
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire it's a
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer organization concerned about
 
04:50:30.750 --> 04:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
governance and fiscal responsibility in
 
04:50:35.548 --> 04:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
school districts so um what house bill
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
564 does is it basically makes sure that
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
every single Le SAU in New Hampshire
 
04:50:45.390 --> 04:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
actually has a budget if you count how
 
04:50:47.230 --> 04:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
many saus we have in New Hampshire it's
 
04:50:52.270 --> 04:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
about it's 105 saus and of the 105 81 of
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
them are what they call single District
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
saus that means that SAU serves a single
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
School District that single School
 
04:51:01.948 --> 04:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
District could be a co-op that could be
 
04:51:05.070 --> 04:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
a regional school or an area school but
 
04:51:07.868 --> 04:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
it only serves one school district so
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
you got to keep in mind the difference
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
between a school district and a town
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
they're not always
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
synonymous um in my school district
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
where I live in Brookline we actually
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
have three school districts in
 
04:51:21.548 --> 04:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
sau41 we have our K through six
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
Brookline School District we have our K
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
through six Hollis school district and
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
then we have the 7 through 12 Hollis
 
04:51:31.230 --> 04:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative School District so
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
there's it's a three District
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
SAU so there was a question before about
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
how do you know who's in the SA and
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
every year um by October 1st the
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education requires many
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
forms about enrollment and such but one
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
of those forms is the form
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
a2d which is uh referenced in here and
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
it has to tell you uh has to report into
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education who's in
 
04:51:58.590 --> 04:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
your SAU and if the person is a
 
04:52:01.548 --> 04:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
portioned it can be put down as a FTE if
 
04:52:03.628 --> 04:52:03.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe they're supported by the
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
SAU half of the time and then maybe by
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
one of the school district by half of
 
04:52:09.110 --> 04:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
the time they'd be 0 five on that form
 
04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
but there's no there's no mystery about
 
04:52:14.590 --> 04:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
who's in the SAU um under that process
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
so if you have a single District SAU
 
04:52:18.310 --> 04:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
they don't really have to have a budget
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
it just becomes part of the school
 
04:52:21.070 --> 04:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
budget and I think that's the the
 
04:52:23.310 --> 04:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
frustration with a lot of school
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
districts that are single district saus
 
04:52:28.270 --> 04:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
there are a couple that do break it out
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
but they just don't want to break it out
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
for some reason in most cases um and I
 
04:52:33.910 --> 04:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
put down some of the things that are
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
used if you looking if take I took a
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
sample at school districts across the
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
state in the single District SAU so it's
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
really not clear how how much you're
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
actually spending on the SAU so that's
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
77% of saus are in that category the
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
other 23% actually are multi-district
 
04:52:50.830 --> 04:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
seus because they have to actually have
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
an SAU budget so if there's multi
 
04:52:54.910 --> 04:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
multiple school districts they actually
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to have a separate budget because
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
they have to apportion it to the school
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
district um and that means that then
 
04:53:05.948 --> 04:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
that becomes um that becomes typically a
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
line item in the School District budget
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the constituent uh school
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
districts however um so you can see it
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
there so for 23% they actually have a
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
budget um the multi-district saus have
 
04:53:25.548 --> 04:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
to have uh do this process in Janu in
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
December because it needs to be done
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
before January 1st so they have a
 
04:53:32.350 --> 04:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
meeting of the collective boards that
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
means the sa board means the school
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
boards of all the saus in my case
 
04:53:39.070 --> 04:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
there's five five and seven so it's a 17
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
person board goes through that budget
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
budget in December and I had one time I
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
remember it was between Christmas and
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
New Year's believe it or not so how much
 
04:53:47.190 --> 04:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
public input are you getting there they
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
vote on that they take public input and
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
then they set the budget they also set
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
what they call is an adjusted budget
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's similar to a default budget you
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
have under sb2 but it's for saus it's
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
called the adjusted budget that doesn't
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
happen with these single district
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
saus and so um for most saus AC
 
04:54:08.990 --> 04:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
multi-district saus of 21 of them they
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
actually just make it a line item
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
in the uh in their operating budget for
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
that um for that specific SAU now there
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
is an alternative budget procedure that
 
04:54:22.510 --> 04:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
currently exists for
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
saus and um and I've we've actually
 
04:54:28.030 --> 04:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
adopted in sau41 there's three school
 
04:54:30.510 --> 04:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
districts that are using that so in that
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
case the school district gets the um
 
04:54:37.310 --> 04:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
gets the a portioned part of their
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
school district which will be a proposed
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
SAU budget and an adjust Ed uh SAU
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
budget and that goes on the warrant as a
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article but that's
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that you have to uh
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
enable and it's very difficult to pass
 
04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
because you have to have the school
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
boards agree to put it on and they
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
typically don't or you have to get
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
petitions to put it in in every school
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
district with the same language the same
 
04:55:01.230 --> 04:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
year and have it pass and we did that
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
and some a few have done that but it's
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
not easy so this bill isn't actually
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
doing anything new it's just requiring
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
that that this procedure that we have
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
today that which works well and I can
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
talk in detail about it um be used for
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
all school districts so that is actually
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
a separate warrant article for every SAU
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
in every District in the state I don't
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
think that's too much to ask and I think
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem is the growth
 
04:55:30.670 --> 04:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
in SAU budgets is because there's this
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
process where the voters have very
 
04:55:35.830 --> 04:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
little very little control um even under
 
04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
the alternative budget procedure that
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
that that gives you some control and you
 
04:55:44.350 --> 04:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
have some ability to what's going on so
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
um let's see here
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
so for example let talk a little bit
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
about how the voting works so I'll talk
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
about seu 41 because I'm in it we have
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
our Hollis bookland Co-op which is a
 
04:55:59.190 --> 04:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting we have our Hollis
 
04:56:00.590 --> 04:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
School District which which is a
 
04:56:02.430 --> 04:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting and then we have our
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
Brookline School District which is s SP2
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
so we have a mix of these we've been
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
using this procedure for um and we
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
actually change changed the SP2 in the
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
Brookline School District about eight
 
04:56:15.150 --> 04:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
years ago so we had traditional
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
traditional traditional but now we have
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
SP2 for one of them the process works
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's there's no mystery there everyone
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
knows how to do it about the ballots
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
you're basically trying to count up the
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
ballots for every single School District
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
so in our case there's three school
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
district meetings and in two of them
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's a ballot vote by a secret ballot at
 
04:56:37.030 --> 04:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
the meeting under the traditional
 
04:56:38.510 --> 04:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and in the brook line one it's
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
secret ballot but it's on the S SP2 on
 
04:56:43.150 --> 04:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
Election Day so when all of the ballots
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
are collected the the school district
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
clerks get together and they put
 
04:56:49.110 --> 04:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
together what the actual result is and
 
04:56:51.910 --> 04:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
if it's a majority yes then the proposed
 
04:56:55.270 --> 04:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
budget of the SAU is is adopted and if
 
04:56:57.750 --> 04:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's a uh if it's less than a majority
 
04:56:59.788 --> 04:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
then you get the adjusted budget similar
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
to what happens under sb2 with a default
 
04:57:05.548 --> 04:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
budget so this isn't new it's being used
 
04:57:07.750 --> 04:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
today so there's no confusion in
 
04:57:10.548 --> 04:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
actually how it works what as what what
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
what house bill 564 does is it makes
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
every single um School District in the
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
state actually have an SAU budget and
 
04:57:20.430 --> 04:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
like I said they know who's in the SAU
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
because of the 82d forms every year so
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
it's not like they have to think figure
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
that out so um one thing I just wanted
 
04:57:30.750 --> 04:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
to mention is that just the the
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
motivation for this is that this bill
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
was proposed two years ago and um this
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
right now we have 18 superintendents
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
making 17 $7,000 or more including one
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
making 210,000 a year in the Oyster
 
04:57:48.548 --> 04:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
River we have 61 assistant
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents in the state we have six
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
scus that have two assistants and we
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
have we have six scus that have two
 
04:57:58.628 --> 04:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
assistants and we have two seus that
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
have three assistant superintendant and
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
I list them in here who who they are
 
04:58:05.788 --> 04:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
just two years ago when we had slightly
 
04:58:08.030 --> 04:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
more students we had just 10
 
04:58:10.590 --> 04:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents over 170k
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we had just 51 assistant
 
04:58:15.390 --> 04:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
superintendents now we have 61 so why
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
are we keep getting this growth because
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of visibility into the
 
04:58:18.920 --> 04:58:20.150 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of visibility into the
SAU

04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
04:58:23.470 --> 04:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
budget so so what is sa at the bottom
 
04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
here it talks about the solution um what
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
does this do it ensures all seus
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually propose a known transparent SAU
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
budget in a separate warrant article so
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
that the voters can vote on it it's not
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
just seeing it it's actually being able
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
to vote on
 
04:58:42.590 --> 04:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
it the um it does require the balloting
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
and budget procedures that are exist
 
04:58:45.990 --> 04:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
today under the alternative procedure to
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
be used as the procedure for all school
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
districts and it works well it's being
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
used already uh in our state um what
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
does it require single District seu have
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
to update their accounting practices
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
they have to account for the Personnel
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
that are on their a2d
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
form multidistrict seus already have to
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
do that they have to determine the
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted budget can the adjusted budget
 
04:59:11.830 --> 04:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
contains no new position services or pay
 
04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
raises and the voters get to decide if
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
they want to pay for those or not and
 
04:59:17.470 --> 04:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
then they have to actually conduct a
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
public budget hearing that we have today
 
04:59:22.110 --> 04:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
for the uh multi-district scus all of
 
04:59:23.948 --> 04:59:23.958 align:start position:0%
them would would would actually have
 
04:59:27.150 --> 04:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
that hearing so it really provides
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
Clarity to the voter because the SAU
 
04:59:31.150 --> 04:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
budget is a separate warn article it
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
directly empowers voters in the
 
04:59:34.628 --> 04:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
districts to decide between the proposed
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
an SAU budget via a ballot vote and when
 
04:59:40.510 --> 04:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
the SAU budget proposal get is
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
transparent and gets voters scrutiny
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
it'll tend to drive more responsible and
 
04:59:47.310 --> 04:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable budgeting in our
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
saus and with that I'll take any
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions if folks have it on the uh on
 
04:59:51.760 --> 04:59:52.868 align:start position:0%
questions if folks have it on the uh on
HP

04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
HP
 
04:59:56.830 --> 04:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
564 thank you if I could just um ask um
 
05:00:01.548 --> 05:00:01.558 align:start position:0%
if you said that the uh doe 812 D form
 
05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
um is not completed by single District
 
05:00:08.310 --> 05:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
saus No every single School dist a2d
 
05:00:12.910 --> 05:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
Alpha 12 Delta yeah okay rury uh thank
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
question just for clarity I'm trying to
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
understand are you testifying a bit on
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of an organization or you uh
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
because you enumerate being uh uh the
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
president of an organization or you
 
05:00:29.110 --> 05:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
testifying on your own behalf or could
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
could you maybe um uh give a brief
 
05:00:34.390 --> 05:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
description of what the uh School
 
05:00:36.750 --> 05:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
District governance Association is
 
05:00:37.868 --> 05:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
School District governance Association
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
is a volunteer organization of members
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
across the state include uh including
 
05:00:42.320 --> 05:00:43.628 align:start position:0%
across the state include uh including
state

05:00:43.628 --> 05:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
representatives um and so we're no one
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
organization forther
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair yes represent Freeman
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr Po
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us and just to
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
kind of piggyback off what you just said
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
about the um School District uh
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
governance Association you're also not a
 
05:01:10.110 --> 05:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
lobbying group is that correct that's
 
05:01:15.390 --> 05:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
you uh looking back at the last term's
 
05:01:20.798 --> 05:01:22.750 align:start position:0%
you uh looking back at the last term's
bill

05:01:22.750 --> 05:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:01:26.788 --> 05:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to recall maybe you can uh
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory in terms of some of
 
05:01:32.590 --> 05:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
the um issues that uh came up in the uh
 
05:01:36.548 --> 05:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
testimony with that prior
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill I think that people didn't quite
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
understand and what the bill did I think
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
that was there was a there wasn't a lot
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
of time to explain it um it there was a
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
Senate bill I think it was Senate Bill
 
05:01:51.548 --> 05:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
155 if I remember correctly um and so
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
there wasn't the opportunity to
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
understand it and I think when people to
 
05:01:56.430 --> 05:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
understand things they want to vote no
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
on things so I think that's where it was
 
05:02:02.190 --> 05:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
but I think we've continued to see the
 
05:02:03.948 --> 05:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh growth in administrative costs so I
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
think it's becoming a more and a more
 
05:02:05.680 --> 05:02:06.948 align:start position:0%
think it's becoming a more and a more
highin

05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
highin
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
item thank you represent Bon
 
05:02:11.548 --> 05:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:02:13.708 --> 05:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just to clarify
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
you you have said that the procedure to
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
do this is already in statute um you're
 
05:02:25.390 --> 05:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
just taking away uh the ability for the
 
05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
it representative we're not taking well
 
05:02:33.628 --> 05:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
we're we're not taking it this it's
 
05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
complicated for a second little back up
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
so today the enabling legislation that's
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
available is only available for
 
05:02:44.470 --> 05:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
multi-district saus so if you're in the
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
77% of saus you do not have that option
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
if you're in the 23% I guess I could say
 
05:02:52.750 --> 05:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
yes but you're not going to take away
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
the option to do it you're going to be
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
able to utilize that directly it's a
 
05:03:00.430 --> 05:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
very difficult uh RSA to adopt because
 
05:03:02.190 --> 05:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
it has to be voted in by all the school
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
year and um which sa which RSA was you
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
were you referring to just now in that
 
05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
answer chairman it's um the RSA that's
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
there now is the alternative budget
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
procedure I think it's
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 194 C9 a
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
b or na A and B I think okay I think
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
once the adoption of it one's the actual
 
05:03:36.430 --> 05:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
use ofage of it
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
right so that becomes the becomes
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
something everyone uses instead of so
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's proven it's not a new thing it's
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
already being used
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
today right I think there was a prior
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
question um uh about um if there were if
 
05:03:58.430 --> 05:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
the SAU costs are proportioned
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
out um to each of the
 
05:04:04.868 --> 05:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
districts um so that each there's let's
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
say three
 
05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
towns and each town has um an item um in
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
their budget for SAU costs for their
 
05:04:19.390 --> 05:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
Town um what happens if two towns pass
 
05:04:22.110 --> 05:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
their share of the SAU budget and one
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
town does
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
not chairman lad I mean chairman uh
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli sorry used to the other
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee um so the um the way it works
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's not really Town although it could
 
05:04:37.708 --> 05:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
be town it's really member school
 
05:04:40.990 --> 05:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
districts yes so if you have a if you
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
have a multi- toown co-op you have a
 
05:04:45.150 --> 05:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
single district meeting that would be a
 
05:04:48.548 --> 05:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
warn article at that meeting um but the
 
05:04:51.548 --> 05:04:51.558 align:start position:0%
way it works is you take the so for
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
those who aren't aware a portion of SAU
 
05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
costs by default is 50% average daily
 
05:05:00.310 --> 05:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
membership 50% equalized valuation it's
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
kind of like a co-op but that's the
 
05:05:04.270 --> 05:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's the formula that's used for
 
05:05:06.868 --> 05:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
apportioning the costs uh across the
 
05:05:06.878 --> 05:05:08.310 align:start position:0%
apportioning the costs uh across the
school

05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
districts just last year there was a
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill that allowed that formula to be
 
05:05:16.590 --> 05:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
different um so they can now adopt a new
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh apportionment formula for saus if
 
05:05:21.470 --> 05:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
they choose to that's adopted um by a
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
vote as well um
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
so the the choice between the adjusted
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
budget and the proposed budget is done
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
by a majority ballot vote collecting the
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
B the ballot yes and NOS from each of
 
05:05:37.590 --> 05:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
the school districts meetings and when
 
05:05:39.788 --> 05:05:39.798 align:start position:0%
the last District votes then you know
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
the result of the of the outcome if
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
05:05:49.590 --> 05:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none right now thank

information sort of I I just want to
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee for
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
misidentifying the Department of
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%

05:06:21.520 --> 05:06:24.030 align:start position:0%
problem it's easy to get forms confused
around

05:06:24.030 --> 05:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:26.830 --> 05:06:26.840 align:start position:0%

hb564 and um we can begin the hearing on
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:01.110 --> 05:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
bullying and we welcome representative

McDonald to present her bill hello
hi

05:07:06.990 --> 05:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay are you ready yep okay
 
05:07:12.788 --> 05:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
for the record I am Valerie McDonald
 
05:07:15.310 --> 05:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham 25 which is my
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
hometown of Salem and also where my
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors live and I'm here
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
as the prime sponsor of HB 108 relative
 
05:07:24.750 --> 05:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
to bullying and cyber bullying across
 
05:07:26.110 --> 05:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
multiple school
 
05:07:28.470 --> 05:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
districts first thank you for paying
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
attention to this critical issue
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
bullying can be challenging to address
 
05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
because it likely has occurred since
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
beginning of time and it's not as simple
 
05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
as creating a law that mandates
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you all know um we wouldn't
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
be able to enforce that especially among
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
children when we can acknowledge that
 
05:07:49.948 --> 05:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
even adults struggle to be kind at times
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
but what we can do is remedy bullying
 
05:07:55.390 --> 05:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
when it inevitably occurs and that's
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
what HB 108 hopes to do this year alone
 
05:08:00.270 --> 05:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
there are three bills which aim to
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
combat bullying one is actually going to
 
05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
be heard after this bill um but they
 
05:08:06.430 --> 05:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
each come from a different perspective
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
hp1 orwe specifically does not conflict
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
with either so if the committee decided
 
05:08:12.990 --> 05:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
it could be passed alongside either bill
 
05:08:15.628 --> 05:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
without any conflict furthermore the
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
other two bills examine the big picture
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
whereas HB 108 focuses on the more
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
nuanced issues of cross District
 
05:08:24.510 --> 05:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
bullying as well as cyber
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
bullying being the only Bill to address
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
these specific issues it would have a
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit to the well-being and
 
05:08:32.430 --> 05:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
as well as the mental health of New
 
05:08:32.440 --> 05:08:33.470 align:start position:0%
as well as the mental health of New
Hampshire

05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
students unfortunately this is not a
 
05:08:38.590 --> 05:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
proactive measure although I really wish
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
it was in reality students have had
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
access to advanced technology for the
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
better part of two decades so the future
 
05:08:49.470 --> 05:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
that past legislatures could only dream
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
of is already here and in large part has
 
05:08:56.590 --> 05:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
already happened so we are behind in
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
addressing cyber bullying but I don't
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
think that's really the legislator's
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
fault because the technology has rapidly
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
Advanced but the legislature is
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
obligated to mitigate the risk to our
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
students and that's what I hope to do
 
05:09:08.798 --> 05:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
students and that's what I hope to do
today

05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:09:11.910 --> 05:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
after all the technology will continue
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
to advance leaving students even more
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to cyber
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
bullying um the heartbreaking story of
 
05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
one of those students inspired a bill
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
which was placed in interim Study last
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
year but a consensus on how to move
 
05:09:28.230 --> 05:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
forward was never reached which
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
indicated that further deliberation was
 
05:09:32.590 --> 05:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
needed and this session I brought this
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill forward to do just that and I look
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
forward to collaborating in a bipartisan
 
05:09:40.110 --> 05:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
manner to reach that consensus and thus
 
05:09:42.590 --> 05:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
a solution for this student her family
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
and for the State of New Hampshire
 
05:09:46.750 --> 05:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
specifically I ask you to draw your
 
05:09:49.230 --> 05:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
attention on the bill to lines 9 through
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
11 they read in cases of bullying and or
 
05:09:54.750 --> 05:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying across multiple School
 
05:09:56.910 --> 05:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
Districts The District where the action
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
originated is responsible for the
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
investigation end quote this sentence
 
05:10:03.910 --> 05:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
answers a question that current law
 
05:10:03.920 --> 05:10:04.948 align:start position:0%
answers a question that current law
leaves

05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
05:10:07.390 --> 05:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
ambiguous who investigates the claim
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
once we suspect bullying has already
 
05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
occurred by putting this best practice
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
into law we would greatly increase
 
05:10:16.670 --> 05:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
accountability however if the committee
 
05:10:18.270 --> 05:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
would rather the other District be
 
05:10:20.230 --> 05:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
responsible to the investigation I'm not
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to that either I just think it's
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
important that we put a responsibility
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
in law regardless of who it is the law
 
05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
should clearly State who that entity is
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
in fact I have spoken with um New
 
05:10:32.990 --> 05:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association so
 
05:10:35.310 --> 05:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
nhba as well as
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
nhsaa and they are in the early stages
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
of drafting an amendment from what I
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
have seen I'd be open to the changes
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
they propose and I understand that they
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
will both be testifying today as well
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
but finally I know this is not the
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
finance committee but it is worth noting
 
05:10:52.548 --> 05:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not have a fiscal
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
impact whatsoever but considering the
 
05:10:57.430 --> 05:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
financial side in the context of
 
05:10:58.830 --> 05:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
bullying I will leave you with an
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
anonymous quote which is kindness is
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
free to give but Priceless to receive
 
05:11:05.240 --> 05:11:06.190 align:start position:0%
free to give but Priceless to receive
thank

05:11:06.190 --> 05:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for the quote as
 
05:11:08.878 --> 05:11:10.230 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for the quote as
well

05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh questions representative
 
05:11:14.910 --> 05:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
celik thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
my question and as you know the next
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill is the one that I've sponsored
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
relating to data around this issue um in
 
05:11:25.150 --> 05:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
the work that I did last summer with the
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
a special committee about juveniles who
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
commit misdemeanors with a Target focus
 
05:11:32.070 --> 05:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
on hate crimes one of the things that
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
became clear with a number of these
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
incidents is that they um sometimes get
 
05:11:40.510 --> 05:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
escalated to the level where police need
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
to be involved in the investigations
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
beyond the school districts themselves
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
um especially where students who may not
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
be or children who may not be in a
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
school a public school setting are
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the cyber bullying and so
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
I'm curious in in those circumstances
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
because obviously police investigations
 
05:12:02.070 --> 05:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
have a cost right so there then would be
 
05:12:04.670 --> 05:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note attributed to it but also
 
05:12:06.030 --> 05:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
where you have circumstances where
 
05:12:08.110 --> 05:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps the cyber bully is someone who's
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
not attending a school system where you
 
05:12:14.548 --> 05:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
see having an investigative Authority
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
and if you thought about that component
 
05:12:17.708 --> 05:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
of it if there's a way we could amend
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
this to address those
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances um or for example if you
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
know if it originated let's say at my
 
05:12:27.030 --> 05:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
house would I be responsible for
 
05:12:29.750 --> 05:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
investigating the issue with my child
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
right because I'm home if I chose to
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
homeschool my child I'm not a school
 
05:12:35.390 --> 05:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
district right so I'm just trying to
 
05:12:37.390 --> 05:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
understand how that would come together
 
05:12:39.430 --> 05:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's complicated no understand
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
the question and I'd like to thank you
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
for that but also for your bill and
 
05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're addressing this issue from
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
another angle I do appreciate it in
 
05:12:48.548 --> 05:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
terms of that question if the police
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
were to be involved I understand there
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
could potentially be a cost to doing
 
05:12:54.510 --> 05:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
that um the LBA did not note that in
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
their um amount of the bill I imagine
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a more rare circumstance
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
it would probably be negligible but it
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
could perhaps amount to a cost I would
 
05:13:04.350 --> 05:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
assessment um the way the bill is WR now
 
05:13:10.470 --> 05:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
it does say where the action originated
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
um the district where the action
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
originated so I'm unaware of the impact
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
that would have on homeschoolers but
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's definitely something that the
 
05:13:17.590 --> 05:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee may want to look at I would
 
05:13:20.190 --> 05:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
agree and as I said I am open to
 
05:13:21.948 --> 05:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
amending language I have spoken to the
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
school boards Association and it is not
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
written in the form of an amendment for
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
OS yet but I imagine if the committee
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to go in that direction I could I
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
could arrange that to happen but on that
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment they say that the principal of
 
05:13:37.110 --> 05:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
the district or their design shall be
 
05:13:40.270 --> 05:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure the can um
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
investigation is conducted if they
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
believe that the police needs to get
 
05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
involved it be their perview not that
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
the principal has to do the
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
investigation themselves just that they
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
find somebody to do so and that that is
 
05:13:51.390 --> 05:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
their responsibility hope that answers
 
05:13:51.400 --> 05:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
their responsibility hope that answers
the

05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you rent Murray thank you
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
Mr shair thank you for taking my
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
question um and thank you for bringing
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
the bill forward um in in an instance
 
05:14:04.708 --> 05:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
where perhaps um things cross state
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
lines or it's later determined that um
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
some exists I'm I'm curious how you
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
would determine with cyber bullying
 
05:14:15.548 --> 05:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
initially where the locus of it is
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
originating from without an
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
investigation um sometimes that is hard
 
05:14:21.310 --> 05:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
to determine and and sometimes it's
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
never determined and it's so I'm curious
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
to know how you would navigate that
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
conversation as well okay so this bill
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned um comes from a bill
 
05:14:33.548 --> 05:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
filed last term and that was because
 
05:14:35.070 --> 05:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
specific instance where we did know
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
where the action originated it was one
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
particular student over I believe the
 
05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
the application they use with Snapchat
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
sending pictures and um to be frank
 
05:14:45.190 --> 05:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat even sexual remarks to a young
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
girl um to my recollection the young
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
girl was a recent immigrant so there was
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
a language Bearer as well so it's
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
picking on somebody who doesn't
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
understand so it seems to me even more
 
05:14:59.470 --> 05:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching and this is a solution
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
to that scenario I'm not sure how it
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
would impact if we don't know where this
 
05:15:05.788 --> 05:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
the situation is so again I'd be open to
 
05:15:07.150 --> 05:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
working with the committee to answer
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
questions like that if the bill um to
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
your recollection does not answer that
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
already then I'd be happy to make it
 
05:15:12.718 --> 05:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
already then I'd be happy to make it
more

05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
clear represent
 
05:15:19.070 --> 05:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um cyber bullying
 
05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a is a big problem I think we can all
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that and some of the issues
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
that have been brought up are
 
05:15:31.470 --> 05:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
problematic and and mine was kind of
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
along the same
 
05:15:35.708 --> 05:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
lines what if there's sometimes like a
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
lot of these I'm thinking of pictures
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
being sent and um it involves multiple
 
05:15:44.030 --> 05:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
children uh students or children some
 
05:15:45.548 --> 05:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
might be in private school some might be
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
in public school um and I that to me is
 
05:15:52.868 --> 05:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
is another complication with that with
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
with this and I agree it's something
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
that should be addressed um I'm just
 
05:15:58.230 --> 05:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's might be something
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
that you've talked about in terms of an
 
05:16:01.470 --> 05:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
amendment or how to how to make that
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you for the
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
question I have not considered that
 
05:16:07.708 --> 05:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
particularly um but I am open to again
 
05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
having that discussion in my my goal
 
05:16:12.110 --> 05:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
today is to have this um please correct
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but I in speaking with
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman cordelli I understand since
 
05:16:17.310 --> 05:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
there are several bullying bills that we
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
will have a work session in regards to
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
these bills where a lot of those issues
 
05:16:23.628 --> 05:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
could be worked out and again if that is
 
05:16:25.150 --> 05:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
what's needed for this to pass I'd be
 
05:16:27.548 --> 05:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
open to that type of amendment as
 
05:16:30.190 --> 05:16:30.200 align:start position:0%
well correct I I think we will have
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
further discussions on this uh topic uh
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
as a committee um possibly as a full
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
committee work session um in the uh your
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
future um represent Woodcock you had a
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you CH thank you for
 
05:16:47.110 --> 05:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward and keeping the
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
concern Uh current clearly um two
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions last year um I remember
 
05:16:54.990 --> 05:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
similar as you were talking before
 
05:16:58.470 --> 05:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative lad had the question of
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veron border yes um
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
and how does that work here if the
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont border was the the action
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
occurred and in the youngst in Hampshire
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
school I don't I don't figure how it's I
 
05:17:14.190 --> 05:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't see the answer here but I remember
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
that question from last year I didn't
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
know if over the summer of the study
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
that it was resolved thank you for the
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
question I would note that
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative lad is a co-sponsor of
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
the bill so if he were to still have the
 
05:17:28.190 --> 05:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
concern I imagine it's been addressed
 
05:17:29.548 --> 05:17:29.558 align:start position:0%
again you'd have to follow up with him
 
05:17:32.590 --> 05:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to speak for him I my
 
05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
district is on the Massachusetts border
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
so I would imagine we have a similar
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
concern um we the state of New Hampshire
 
05:17:41.830 --> 05:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
does not have any cross districts
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
districts that are on the Massachusetts
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
border where we do contract with I
 
05:17:46.830 --> 05:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
believe in St John's buy Vermont that's
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
not the same case in Massachusetts but
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I see the potential for that my goal
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
with this legislation if it's not
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
exactly as worded is to put something
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
into law that addresses this and we say
 
05:17:59.788 --> 05:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
clearly who is responsible so we're not
 
05:18:00.990 --> 05:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
passing the bck so there is
 
05:18:02.670 --> 05:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
accountability and we know who is doing
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
this if this wording isn't exactly
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
correct then I'm willing to put in the
 
05:18:08.270 --> 05:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
work to make this happen and collaborate
 
05:18:10.910 --> 05:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
with I need to to get this accomplished
 
05:18:12.910 --> 05:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
right okay and I think if I remember
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
correctly U you described the incident
 
05:18:18.548 --> 05:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
that uh initiated the bill last year and
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
I think it was a question of um who is
 
05:18:24.270 --> 05:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
going to investigate it and neither
 
05:18:27.910 --> 05:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
School wanted to uh take on that role
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that initiated a lot of
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
discussion um at the state level as well
 
05:18:34.708 --> 05:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
yes unfortunately neither District was
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
owning up to this perhaps because of the
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
expense or to do so and so I just wanted
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
to put something into law so that
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
student isn't vulnerable because no
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
adults are taking responsibility as they
 
05:18:48.750 --> 05:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
should representative sell thank you um
 
05:18:50.910 --> 05:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and thank you for bringing
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
this forward um earlier this year I
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
received a heartbreaking email from uh
 
05:18:59.310 --> 05:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
one of our someone in the state not from
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
my district but whose son was a victim
 
05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
of cyber bullying through snapchat he's
 
05:19:05.310 --> 05:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
a child with special needs and someone
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
created a fake account of his which then
 
05:19:09.868 --> 05:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
he got got in trouble for and he was
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
sent to a different District where the
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
people who created the account are
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
currently having no consequences for
 
05:19:18.030 --> 05:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
their behavior and so I just would
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
invite us when we get to our work
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
session to Think Through not just the
 
05:19:23.400 --> 05:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
session to Think Through not just the
who

05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
investigates but how can we create some
 
05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
sort of appropriate but not
 
05:19:33.788 --> 05:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
discriminatory aspect of consequences
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
for some of this behavior and it's
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
really complicated as I'll get into when
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
we get to my bill next but um I do know
 
05:19:43.150 --> 05:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
that parent I mean like it will
 
05:19:44.708 --> 05:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
literally make you cry if I share the
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
details of the things that she sent to
 
05:19:52.190 --> 05:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
me so yes we've um heard a number of
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
cases since I've been here of of Bing um
 
05:20:01.510 --> 05:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and uh suicide um that uh you know are
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching for sure yeah so um yeah
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's something I definitely want us to
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at as a committee see what
 
05:20:13.590 --> 05:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
we can uh Advance um uh to the house
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
FL represent of Woodcock this maybe your
 
05:20:21.430 --> 05:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
Workshop as well um I'm confused about
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
the term action
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
originated only to the extent
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative of me clear to me was
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
victim and perpetrator victim like that
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if if the action for example was two
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
victim in the
 
05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
same was there as well as a victim in
 
05:20:51.600 --> 05:20:52.830 align:start position:0%
same was there as well as a victim in
that

05:20:52.830 --> 05:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:57.150 --> 05:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
school say a dance okay and that night
 
05:20:59.948 --> 05:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
that's where the hit the
 
05:21:04.110 --> 05:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
pan it was there they go back this peret
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
goes back to the school that that's what
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
getting confused that little there maybe
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
something represent wants to dialogue in
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
the workshop that that's having a high
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
time with those terms versus victim
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
victim okay um me I'm my intention was
 
05:21:23.868 --> 05:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
not to include words such as victim or
 
05:21:26.430 --> 05:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
perpetrator because that almost implies
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
the result of the investigation before
 
05:21:30.670 --> 05:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
it happens to say this person did
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
something when we don't know that to be
 
05:21:34.030 --> 05:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
true kind of goes against innocence
 
05:21:35.948 --> 05:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
until proven guilty which is why I
 
05:21:38.350 --> 05:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
settled on the words action originated I
 
05:21:40.270 --> 05:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
understand and your concern my intention
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
with this is the district the student
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
attends if the action occurred perhaps
 
05:21:47.150 --> 05:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
at a school dance like you mentioned I
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see that as the district the
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
student attends if it's an outof
 
05:21:52.590 --> 05:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
District student but that's how I would
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
read this thank
 
05:21:55.360 --> 05:21:57.030 align:start position:0%
read this thank
you

05:21:57.030 --> 05:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
Paul Mr chair and this is more of a
 
05:22:01.548 --> 05:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
point I think than a question but as we
 
05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
talk about out of state know we're
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
talking about neighboring St Johnsbury
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring Massachusetts it could be
 
05:22:11.548 --> 05:22:11.558 align:start position:0%
not neighboring Kansas right it could be
 
05:22:13.150 --> 05:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere I mean to suggest that it's
 
05:22:15.070 --> 05:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
even just across the border you know
 
05:22:17.628 --> 05:22:17.638 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying can happen anywhere so
 
05:22:21.430 --> 05:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
adds another layer to this yes gu that
 
05:22:24.110 --> 05:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't would you believe yes I would
 
05:22:25.510 --> 05:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
believe that doesn't surprise me in the
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
slightest bit um as it's been noted by a
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
few of you it's definitely a complicated
 
05:22:31.150 --> 05:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
issue and that's something that should
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
be considered but it would be remiss not
 
05:22:35.548 --> 05:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
to do anything just because it's
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
difficult that's not an excuse for us
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
not to act right thank
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
05:22:46.628 --> 05:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
05:22:52.990 --> 05:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.590 --> 05:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
Perez welcome to education again or
 
05:22:56.600 --> 05:22:57.670 align:start position:0%

policy thank you thank you committee
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
members thank you chairman cardelli this
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
was my bill last year and I presented it
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
to you all
 
05:23:14.070 --> 05:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
and um I was thrilled to hear when um
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald was going to
 
05:23:18.430 --> 05:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
bring it forward and it seems that a lot
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the same questions um are coming up
 
05:23:24.190 --> 05:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
again and
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the story that was from last year
 
05:23:32.830 --> 05:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
just had to was heart-wrenching it was a
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
woman a young girl who lived in
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
um District a
 
05:23:42.070 --> 05:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
District B had a young man who had a
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
relative in District um a said hey
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's this fat ugly immigrant
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
here and this guy started harassing her
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
and calling her names and sending
 
05:23:59.070 --> 05:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
pictures and that type of thing
 
05:24:02.110 --> 05:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's my understanding that
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
nothing happened to
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
that be and
 
05:24:11.788 --> 05:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
it's heart-wrenching to think the the
 
05:24:14.310 --> 05:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
young girl actually was so traumatized
 
05:24:15.910 --> 05:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
by this she was out of school for like
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
two weeks I believe before she could
 
05:24:19.548 --> 05:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
return to
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
school this is about the kids and cyber
 
05:24:25.470 --> 05:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
we all know cyber building is so out of
 
05:24:28.350 --> 05:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
control it's out of control for
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
adults as well as for children but my
 
05:24:35.150 --> 05:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
concern is this is year two that we are
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward and we cannot
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
continue to Kick Kick the Can down the
 
05:24:44.830 --> 05:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
road until something
 
05:24:48.190 --> 05:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
extremely traumatic happens bullying
 
05:24:52.350 --> 05:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
does cause children to commit suicide
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying is makes it so easy for
 
05:24:59.070 --> 05:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
them as far as finding out who did it
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
the one good thing about cyber bullying
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
is they really technically can find out
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
who the perpetrator was whereas
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
verbal bullying in the school it's a
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
more of a he said she
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
said that's why this is so out of contr
 
05:25:19.150 --> 05:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
troll because they think that they don't
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
have to the kids you know they don't
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
have to face the person they can just be
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
horrendous to them I really would like
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
to see and I know there's a lot of
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions about it and so you work them
 
05:25:37.150 --> 05:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
out you find them you decide what's the
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
important thing we've changed laws I
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
mean if we find that one this isn't
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
perfect when we when you hash it around
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can look at maybe making it more
 
05:25:52.270 --> 05:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
perfect but it can't be kicked down the
 
05:25:55.390 --> 05:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
road anymore we can't lose any more
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
children to suicide because of bullying
 
05:26:03.788 --> 05:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
and this is about the kids totally 100%
 
05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you for listening I'd be happy
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you very
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
much representative any questions
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative Balon uh thank you Mr
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:26:16.510 --> 05:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
question um something that you said just
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
kind of uh struck me as a the schools
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
can only do so much in terms of you know
 
05:26:24.910 --> 05:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
tracking these things you I mean
 
05:26:26.948 --> 05:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
bullying is an all pervasive problem
 
05:26:30.350 --> 05:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
that involves other people in a in a in
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
a student's life so I would hope that
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at these bullying
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
bills we look at more a
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh solution to the problem
 
05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
so and I agree with you we need to do

briefly um earlier this morning um I was
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
being passed around is a proposed
 
05:27:40.270 --> 05:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that the School Board
 
05:27:43.470 --> 05:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
Association drafted up um I think trying
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
to stay um with what representative
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
McDonald's intent was um when you have
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
bullying across multiple school
 
05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
districts and whose responsibility is it
 
05:27:55.230 --> 05:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
to investigate um again we haven't had a
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
chance to do a deep dive into this but
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'll just read it briefly it's the it's
 
05:28:01.628 --> 05:28:01.638 align:start position:0%
the language and bold in front of you in
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
cases of bullying or cyber bullying
 
05:28:05.948 --> 05:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
across multiple School Districts The
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
principls or principles designate
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
of all districts involved shall be
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for conducting an
 
05:28:14.430 --> 05:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
investigation in such investigations the
 
05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
principales or design are encouraged to
 
05:28:19.270 --> 05:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
collaborate relative to their respective
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
investigations um you know from our
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
perspective it doesn't matter where the
 
05:28:27.030 --> 05:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
kids are if one kid is from conquered
 
05:28:29.910 --> 05:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the other kid is from hookset and it
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
occurred at the mall and Manchester and
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
it gets reported to those principles
 
05:28:36.030 --> 05:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
those principles have an obligation to
 
05:28:37.750 --> 05:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
at least do something make some phone
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
calls do an investigation talk to the
 
05:28:42.030 --> 05:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
witnesses whatever your bullying proc
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
whatever your bullying investigation
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
procedures are they're very
 
05:28:46.590 --> 05:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in the statute they're
 
05:28:49.830 --> 05:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive in the nsba policy so
 
05:28:52.670 --> 05:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
again um if there's a committee um uh a
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or whatnot um and and there
 
05:28:57.230 --> 05:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
tweaks to this language on hsba will
 
05:28:59.750 --> 05:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly help in whatever way we can I
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
I hope you sort of caught your intent
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald with what you're
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do not married to this
 
05:29:06.350 --> 05:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
language if there need to be tweaks
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're happy to help um but again uh we
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to to sort of make sure that I
 
05:29:12.788 --> 05:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
don't I don't care who the students are
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
if you're a principal and it comes to
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
your attention you have an obligation to
 
05:29:18.990 --> 05:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
at least do something about it so with
 
05:29:20.590 --> 05:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to to answer any
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative the
 
05:29:24.390 --> 05:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:29:27.030 --> 05:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I appreciate this
 
05:29:30.628 --> 05:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
language um my fear is that if you give
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
a job to a committee Nobody Does it and
 
05:29:35.830 --> 05:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you could combine this
 
05:29:37.628 --> 05:29:37.638 align:start position:0%
by saying maybe the the district where
 
05:29:40.510 --> 05:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
it origin at initiates the cooperation
 
05:29:43.070 --> 05:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
so that somebody starts the process yeah
 
05:29:44.190 --> 05:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for the question
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative again further
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to be had I think
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully we we can we can flush that
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
out we'd be certainly agreeable or
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
amendable to something along those lines
 
05:29:55.830 --> 05:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
whatever language can come out so we
 
05:29:58.350 --> 05:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that again who I don't I don't
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
care where the kids are from if a
 
05:30:01.830 --> 05:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
principal receives a report of that they
 
05:30:03.628 --> 05:30:03.638 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to do something call
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
their principal in the neighboring
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
School talk to the person that filed the
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
report with them whether or not that
 
05:30:11.230 --> 05:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
comes from a parent a student a witness
 
05:30:13.070 --> 05:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the person that informed the
 
05:30:14.708 --> 05:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
principal was not even involved in it
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
but saw it and was concerned about it so
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
reported it to the principal that
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
principal has an obligation to do
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
something even if it's just call your
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
neighbor down the road in the other
 
05:30:24.430 --> 05:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
school even though it wasn't my district
 
05:30:27.510 --> 05:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
but my my child in my district saw it
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
with other kids in other districts that
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
principal should have an obligation to
 
05:30:32.350 --> 05:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
make a phone call so the ball gets
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
rolling and and and it's it's dealt with
 
05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
accordingly thank you um
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
if I could ask one question thank you um
 
05:30:48.430 --> 05:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh where and when and how do you see
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
Parental involvement in this when when
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
is the parent contacted I know there's
 
05:30:57.548 --> 05:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
um statutes involved currently and uh
 
05:31:00.110 --> 05:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's a something like a 48h hour
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
period right to uh conduct an
 
05:31:06.750 --> 05:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
investigation before the parents uh are
 
05:31:08.670 --> 05:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
notified um
 
05:31:10.868 --> 05:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
based on a waiver request by the
 
05:31:12.510 --> 05:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent yeah that's something
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
along those lines sure thank you for the
 
05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
question representative excuse me a
 
05:31:19.390 --> 05:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
second um I'm not trying to dodge the
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
question to some degree that might be
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
more an administrative uh somebody an
 
05:31:24.910 --> 05:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
administrator could answer as I'm sure
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're aware there are 10 references to
 
05:31:29.470 --> 05:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
the word parent in the statute the
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
policy has to have a procedure for
 
05:31:33.788 --> 05:31:33.798 align:start position:0%
notification within 48 Hours of the
 
05:31:35.788 --> 05:31:35.798 align:start position:0%
intendent report to the parent or
 
05:31:37.868 --> 05:31:37.878 align:start position:0%
parents or guardian of the of the victim
 
05:31:39.830 --> 05:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
vitim of bullying or cyber bullying and
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
the parent are parents of the guardian
 
05:31:44.948 --> 05:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
of of the perpetrator you know I mean 48
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
hours I guess we can debate whether or
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
not that's sufficient whether the the
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
parent should be known by the end of the
 
05:31:52.030 --> 05:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
day to some degree it may be you know
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance specific how severe was the
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
action how severe was the allegation is
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
the principal perhaps not in the
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
building that day and it was reported to
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
an assistant principal um you know it it
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
if if an investigation is undergoing is
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
being under undertaken I understand the
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
desire for the parents to be informed
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you know things need to
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
settle out with the administrators and
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
talk to people before you know a
 
05:32:22.708 --> 05:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
judgment is made to call call the parent
 
05:32:24.430 --> 05:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
it may be it may be a rumor maybe
 
05:32:26.990 --> 05:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
nothing happened you know and so there's
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
going to be some level of administrative
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
discretion um if it's significant
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's cyber bullying if it's
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
something that relates to um what would
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
be um illegal or improper
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination you know sexism racism
 
05:32:44.110 --> 05:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be I think there's
 
05:32:46.270 --> 05:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
probably an obligation to call call the
 
05:32:48.190 --> 05:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
parent you know your your kid said these
 
05:32:51.628 --> 05:32:51.638 align:start position:0%
words in the locker room so I hope that
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
answered it somewhat right um in your
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
view um if there is sexism MH invol or
 
05:33:00.360 --> 05:33:01.788 align:start position:0%
view um if there is sexism MH invol or
racism

05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
racism
 
05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
involved um would would you
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
classify um that as
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
bullying or human rights violation uh do
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
you have an idea where that line is
 
05:33:16.510 --> 05:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
because I know of a
 
05:33:19.628 --> 05:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
situation and my understanding is the
 
05:33:21.190 --> 05:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
children have actually left school
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
because of it yeah thank you for the
 
05:33:26.110 --> 05:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
question representative I I I can as as
 
05:33:28.110 --> 05:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer but not a practitioner I
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
can't give a clear answer to that I will
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
tell you though that when the law became
 
05:33:36.030 --> 05:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
effective I 2010 or 2011 when the
 
05:33:38.990 --> 05:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
blowing law became effective that was a
 
05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
question that a lot of the school law
 
05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys were having and I you know I
 
05:33:47.070 --> 05:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
think and I think the the the standard
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
practice right now let say racism is
 
05:33:53.948 --> 05:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
that an investigation is going to cover
 
05:33:57.030 --> 05:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
both it's not Title 9 Title 9 would be
 
05:33:58.470 --> 05:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
sex discrimination but it's going to
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
title think title 7even perhaps and your
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
local District bullying investigation
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the safest way for a
 
05:34:06.868 --> 05:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
school district right to proceed so
 
05:34:08.830 --> 05:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
you've got your basis has covered on the
 
05:34:10.750 --> 05:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
the the federal or state discrimination
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
aspect but also the bullying aspect as
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
well too some of that I also think to
 
05:34:16.830 --> 05:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
again not this maybe more for an
 
05:34:20.510 --> 05:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
administrative aspect it may be the age
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the child as well too an 8-year-old
 
05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
child drops an inappropriate racial slur
 
05:34:29.670 --> 05:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
maybe different than a 17-year-old kid
 
05:34:32.590 --> 05:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing and the context in
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
in in which it's said but I I certainly
 
05:34:37.990 --> 05:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a a situation in a
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
school district probably 10 or 12 years
 
05:34:42.750 --> 05:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
ago and I I say this not jokingly by any
 
05:34:44.788 --> 05:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
means not not not light of it it was it
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
was the perfect plaintiff it was a child
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
of color who was a child with
 
05:34:51.548 --> 05:34:51.558 align:start position:0%
disabilities who was being bullied
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
relentlessly um and unfortunately in
 
05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
that case the district did not um do
 
05:34:58.430 --> 05:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and the office of
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
was on them significantly for a number
 
05:35:05.070 --> 05:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
of years making sure they have policies
 
05:35:07.708 --> 05:35:07.718 align:start position:0%
procedures training training place so
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
long with it answer representative if if
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
if if a district if a superintendent or
 
05:35:13.750 --> 05:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
principal called me and said these are
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
the general facts and it involved a
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
protected class and bowling I'd say do
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
both investigations to make sure you're
 
05:35:24.150 --> 05:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
covered yeah thank you yeah represent
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
Woodcock your turn thank you sir um very
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
represent I mean
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
attorney thank you hey you works too
 
05:35:35.110 --> 05:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah except for chairman right call him
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman lad
 
05:35:40.110 --> 05:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
as regards uh the issue that was brought
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
up uh basically Maine yeah New Hampshire
 
05:35:46.110 --> 05:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
I mean Maine Vermont Massachusetts
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
depending where the bordering towns are
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
right does your uh fellow Associates or
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
does is there done of the one of you in
 
05:35:56.788 --> 05:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont in mass or are you the
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
singular in terms of Association and are
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
there cooperate agreements standing do
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know about thank thank you for the
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
question representative there there is a
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
main Association of school committees
 
05:36:07.868 --> 05:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
there's a main Association of school
 
05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
boards as zont school boards Association
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
we I mean we we collaborate but not in
 
05:36:16.510 --> 05:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
this realm I don't I'm not aware of any
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
sort of Interstate Compact that
 
05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
addresses bullying you know it's sort of
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
an interesting concept if you will now
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
relative I don't remember the bill
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
hearing last year I either wasn't here
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
or perhaps at another hearing um and and
 
05:36:34.030 --> 05:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
kids from St John's Berry kids from
 
05:36:36.670 --> 05:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
Monroe um New Hampshire and some other
 
05:36:38.470 --> 05:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
communities I believe kids of St John's
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
Berry's Academy over the Border you know
 
05:36:44.470 --> 05:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know I I can't speak to Vermont
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
bullying laws I presume St John's Berry
 
05:36:49.390 --> 05:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
academy is subject to to those laws but
 
05:36:51.270 --> 05:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
let's say here's let's let's give me
 
05:36:54.190 --> 05:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'll use representative McDonald sort of
 
05:36:56.910 --> 05:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hometown let's say that a child or
 
05:37:00.750 --> 05:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
student from Salem is um at the is at
 
05:37:02.910 --> 05:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham Mall that's in Salem with
 
05:37:04.670 --> 05:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
a a child from
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
Kingsboro you know and and and the the
 
05:37:11.150 --> 05:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
child from Salem reports to to his or
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
her principal I was bullied at the
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Mall the kid is at Tings Boro
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
High School I would hope that the Salem
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
principal might pick up the horn and
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
call that individual from from T you
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
know the principal in Kingsboro but
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
according to under New Hampshire law
 
05:37:29.510 --> 05:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
there certainly the Salem school
 
05:37:30.910 --> 05:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
district will not they may have an
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
obligation to investigate they probably
 
05:37:34.830 --> 05:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
should at least look into it but they
 
05:37:36.270 --> 05:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't have any jurisdiction
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
over the kid in Kingsboro
 
05:37:40.590 --> 05:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
to Levy any punishment or and and and
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
vice versa if the if the alleged bully
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
was from Salem and the the the the the
 
05:37:50.830 --> 05:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
um the victim was from out of state you
 
05:37:52.430 --> 05:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
know they they the out of state
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts wouldn't have any
 
05:37:55.788 --> 05:37:55.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to do anything to the to
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
the to the New Hampshire
 
05:38:01.310 --> 05:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
student yeah thank you just to follow up
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:38:06.190 --> 05:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
um since you're closer to the main
 
05:38:07.948 --> 05:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
border the
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Main Interstate School
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
compact is RSA uh 200
 
05:38:21.070 --> 05:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
F1 and the remont compact is a 200
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
B1 so those are things we could look at
 
05:38:29.190 --> 05:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
as a in in a work U study thank
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
you yes repres muray thank you Mr Sharon
 
05:38:33.708 --> 05:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question it
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that while we were
 
05:38:38.830 --> 05:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
talking about this sort of um
 
05:38:41.230 --> 05:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
theoretical situation that you were
 
05:38:42.910 --> 05:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
referencing here you were talking about
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
something that may have occurred outside
 
05:38:45.390 --> 05:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
of school
 
05:38:48.830 --> 05:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
hours um so I I I guess what I was
 
05:38:51.868 --> 05:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
curious about is when would this Clause
 
05:38:53.990 --> 05:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
kick in at any time the districts would
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
get involved or is this only at school
 
05:38:59.430 --> 05:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
sanctioned events and under school hours
 
05:39:02.750 --> 05:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
when the alleged incident was occurring
 
05:39:03.750 --> 05:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
05:39:05.548 --> 05:39:05.558 align:start position:0%
representative this is RSA
 
05:39:11.230 --> 05:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
193 DF Frank col 4 paragraph
 
05:39:14.230 --> 05:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
1 bullying or cyber bullying shall occur
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
when an action or communication as
 
05:39:18.150 --> 05:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
193f col 3A occurs on or is delivered to
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
school property or a school sponsored
 
05:39:28.990 --> 05:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
event or an event on or off property off
 
05:39:32.070 --> 05:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
school property excuse me or B occurs
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
off of school property or outside of a
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
school sponsored activity or event if
 
05:39:39.070 --> 05:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
the cont interferes with a pupil's
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities or
 
05:39:43.150 --> 05:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
substantially substantially disrupts the
 
05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
orderly operations of a school or School
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
sponsored activity or event so if the
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
bullying occurs it's Saturday night at
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
the pizza parlor and it's not a school
 
05:39:54.990 --> 05:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored event but the the alleged
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
victim is afraid to come to school on
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
Monday or whatever that would inter
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
substantially conduct that would
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
interfere with a pupil's educational
 
05:40:06.000 --> 05:40:07.510 align:start position:0%
interfere with a pupil's educational
opportunity

05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
05:40:09.788 --> 05:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
likewise if the event was on say a
 
05:40:11.788 --> 05:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
weekend off school property at a
 
05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
non-school sponsored event the movie
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
theater let's say if Monday morning
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
everybody comes in and every kid is
 
05:40:20.948 --> 05:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
talking about it and the principal hears
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
about it the teachers hear about it they
 
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
know it's been posted on social media
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
and the kids are not focusing an
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
argument can be made that that would
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
again this is B substantially disrupt
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
the orderly operations of the school or

barington
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
um in my um first term as a
 
06:04:42.990 --> 06:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative I served on the criminal
 
06:04:46.310 --> 06:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
justice committee and a number of things
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
occurred one is we were hearing about
 
06:04:51.868 --> 06:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
increased incidents of juveniles who
 
06:04:54.830 --> 06:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
were being sentenced to various forms of
 
06:04:56.990 --> 06:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial system um for different
 
06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
different levels of crime different
 
06:05:01.788 --> 06:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
types of incidents at the same time we
 
06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
were also hearing across the state about
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
progressively more incidents of hate
 
06:05:09.990 --> 06:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
crimes occurring and hateful acts and I
 
06:05:11.070 --> 06:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear about the
 
06:05:12.590 --> 06:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
distinction between a hate crime and a
 
06:05:15.190 --> 06:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
hateful act because um the Attorney
 
06:05:17.670 --> 06:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
General's office gave me a 45 minute
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
detailed description of the difference
 
06:05:21.310 --> 06:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
between the two so there are things that
 
06:05:23.548 --> 06:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
we would consider hateful but that may
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
not Elevate to the level of a crime and
 
06:05:28.628 --> 06:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
and so this bill does not talk about
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
hate crimes it talks about hateful acts
 
06:05:34.270 --> 06:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
for a reason um while all of that was
 
06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
happening I started reading about um
 
06:05:38.750 --> 06:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
diversion programs that were working in
 
06:05:41.310 --> 06:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
other states to help young people who
 
06:05:43.948 --> 06:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
made poor decisions not continue to make
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
poor decisions um particularly Howard
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
County Maryland where I used to be a
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
teacher um which is a very diverse
 
06:05:53.110 --> 06:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
School District when they instituted a
 
06:05:54.708 --> 06:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
Teen Court program the teens who were
 
06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
referred to that Court program had only
 
06:06:00.510 --> 06:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
a 5% recidivism rate um which is amazing
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
right and and ideally we would find ways
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
to not have more children enter our
 
06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
judicial system because if they enter as
 
06:06:09.070 --> 06:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
young people the likelihood that they're
 
06:06:10.270 --> 06:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
going to continue to end up in the
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
judicial system as adults is much higher
 
06:06:15.750 --> 06:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
um and so if we can identify way so in
 
06:06:17.548 --> 06:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
the previous session I created a I
 
06:06:20.030 --> 06:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
worked we created a study committee to
 
06:06:21.670 --> 06:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
look at juveniles who commit
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors especially hate crimes and
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
how we could redirect them to Diversion
 
06:06:29.910 --> 06:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
programs or other methods we worked um
 
06:06:31.948 --> 06:06:31.958 align:start position:0%
it was a a voluntary study committee we
 
06:06:33.708 --> 06:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
had four members appointed unfortunately
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
two of them were not reelected which is
 
06:06:38.110 --> 06:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
why they are not co-sponsors on the bill
 
06:06:41.310 --> 06:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
um but we worked collaboratively um and
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
opened the meetings up so that we had
 
06:06:45.948 --> 06:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
members from the ACLU from the Attorney
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
General's office from the um the current
 
06:06:52.310 --> 06:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Diversion programs from the
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate from uh
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth and Family Services
 
06:06:59.310 --> 06:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
all came together and we worked
 
06:07:00.750 --> 06:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
collaboratively and talked about the
 
06:07:03.030 --> 06:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
different issues and what was going on
 
06:07:06.230 --> 06:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge that came up
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
and um was confirmed when a
 
06:07:10.110 --> 06:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department of
 
06:07:14.030 --> 06:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
Education attended our meeting is that
 
06:07:17.868 --> 06:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
we lack data we have a huge gap in data
 
06:07:20.468 --> 06:07:20.478 align:start position:0%
of what's happening so technically prior
 
06:07:22.190 --> 06:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic school districts were
 
06:07:25.230 --> 06:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
directed to create plans to address
 
06:07:27.948 --> 06:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
bullying there wasn't an end date by
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
which they had to have their plan
 
06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
completed they just were directed to
 
06:07:34.350 --> 06:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
create the plan um and then they were
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to report data to the
 
06:07:37.670 --> 06:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education unfortunately
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
the data that's being reported to the
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
department isn't complete and isn't easy
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
to find if if you can find it's really
 
06:07:45.948 --> 06:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
tricky it took me I think two and a half
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
hours to figure out how to get to it on
 
06:07:49.990 --> 06:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
the website and I'm a relatively
 
06:07:52.510 --> 06:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
proficient Searcher online you know I'm
 
06:07:54.628 --> 06:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
not the best I defer to my children who
 
06:07:56.830 --> 06:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
are far faster at locating
 
06:08:00.230 --> 06:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
information um but when the
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department of
 
06:08:03.830 --> 06:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
Education came to our meeting and said
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
well we've got this database
 
06:08:07.750 --> 06:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
I looked at my own school district and
 
06:08:10.868 --> 06:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
it reflected zero incidences of bullying
 
06:08:13.150 --> 06:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
for the district which I knew
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
specifically was not accurate because my
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
child was one of the victims of bullying
 
06:08:19.548 --> 06:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
in our district and we had documentation
 
06:08:21.910 --> 06:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
around that so clearly there was a gap
 
06:08:24.628 --> 06:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't reported to the state right
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
um additionally uh um Deputy uh attorney
 
06:08:31.708 --> 06:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
general Shan lock from the Attorney
 
06:08:33.270 --> 06:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
General's office specifically their
 
06:08:35.190 --> 06:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
division of civil rights crimes was part
 
06:08:37.948 --> 06:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
of our committee and he identified
 
06:08:39.270 --> 06:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the list that there were 10
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
Towns where he had Active cases pending
 
06:08:44.230 --> 06:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
related to bullying incidents specific
 
06:08:46.350 --> 06:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
bullying incidents all of which had
 
06:08:48.830 --> 06:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
reflected zero data on the state's
 
06:08:53.868 --> 06:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
website so there's a gap right and so we
 
06:08:55.830 --> 06:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out how could we
 
06:08:57.868 --> 06:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
design programs or increase or support
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
programs if we don't actually know where
 
06:09:02.708 --> 06:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
the needs are and which areas there are
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
we know that there's a significant
 
06:09:06.510 --> 06:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
difference in how youth are adjudicated
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
whether they live in the North country
 
06:09:09.628 --> 06:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
or whether they live on the Sea Coast
 
06:09:11.070 --> 06:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
based on the resources of those
 
06:09:13.548 --> 06:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
districts and what's available but we
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
don't have any statistical data that
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
shows what the ratios and percentages
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
are so that's sort of the background of
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill so we started talking about
 
06:09:25.110 --> 06:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
well what could we do based on this
 
06:09:27.628 --> 06:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
previous bill that would help us create
 
06:09:29.468 --> 06:09:29.478 align:start position:0%
the data so that we could revisit the
 
06:09:32.390 --> 06:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
issue in a couple of years and look at
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
what would be the best way to serve the
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
needs of our our children to identify
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
the problem address it and hopefully
 
06:09:42.670 --> 06:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
remedy it so the structure of the bill
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
requires um and I did speak with the you
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
know the school administrators
 
06:09:48.070 --> 06:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
Association who prefer it would be every
 
06:09:49.830 --> 06:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
year as opposed to every semester for
 
06:09:51.948 --> 06:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
reporting but that at the end of every
 
06:09:54.150 --> 06:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
semester the school districts would have
 
06:09:56.750 --> 06:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
to report their bullying incidents to
 
06:09:58.670 --> 06:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
the state the state would then have a
 
06:10:01.230 --> 06:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
prescriptive amount of time at the doe
 
06:10:03.548 --> 06:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
to collate all of that data and have it
 
06:10:06.030 --> 06:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
on a very easily publicly accessible
 
06:10:09.230 --> 06:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
website and also share the link of their
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
data to the AG's office for the purposes
 
06:10:15.070 --> 06:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
of Data Tracking because if for example
 
06:10:18.750 --> 06:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
we discover that in um I don't know in
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
Salem people discriminate against those
 
06:10:22.708 --> 06:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
who like The Color Purple which happens
 
06:10:25.150 --> 06:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
to be my favorite color but we've have a
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
history of incidents against people who
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
like The Color Purple in Dairy and we
 
06:10:32.110 --> 06:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
can't figure out why but then perhaps in
 
06:10:34.628 --> 06:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
Portsmith we have the a history where it
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
shows people used to discriminate
 
06:10:37.628 --> 06:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
against people who like the color green
 
06:10:39.190 --> 06:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
and they've remedied it well what did
 
06:10:40.990 --> 06:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
they do in Portsmouth and can we
 
06:10:43.030 --> 06:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
replicate that in other districts can we
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
work through those things but without
 
06:10:46.910 --> 06:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
having the data that shows the trends of
 
06:10:48.628 --> 06:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
when bullying incidents are happening
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
and who's being targeted it's really
 
06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
hard to know how to create structures
 
06:10:55.788 --> 06:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
and programs to try to remedy it whether
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's through education whether it's
 
06:10:59.430 --> 06:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
through diversion programs or other
 
06:11:02.070 --> 06:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
methods so the goal of this is really
 
06:11:04.708 --> 06:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
about Gathering the data and having a
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
structure but it's also looking not just
 
06:11:08.750 --> 06:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
at bullying incidents and reported
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
bullying incidents but hate-based
 
06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
incidents so in my kids high school
 
06:11:14.830 --> 06:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
people were drawing swastikas on the
 
06:11:17.390 --> 06:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
bathroom walls and writing things like
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
kill the
 
06:11:22.110 --> 06:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
nword um right that's technically not
 
06:11:24.070 --> 06:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
bullying technically it's actually not
 
06:11:26.390 --> 06:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
even a hate crime although we would all
 
06:11:29.548 --> 06:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
consider it a hate-based incident right
 
06:11:32.590 --> 06:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
um so the part of this is directing the
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
doe to give the school districts a form
 
06:11:37.430 --> 06:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
that has a drop- down menu that
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
identifies what protected classes are
 
06:11:41.468 --> 06:11:41.478 align:start position:0%
being targeted in incidents such as
 
06:11:43.990 --> 06:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
those right so swastica obviously are
 
06:11:45.430 --> 06:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
targeting people who are Jewish people
 
06:11:46.670 --> 06:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
who are minorities people with
 
06:11:48.590 --> 06:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities you know and the other one
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
is obviously targeting people of um who
 
06:11:53.310 --> 06:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
are black or of African-American descent
 
06:11:57.150 --> 06:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
right um but so because that data is not
 
06:11:59.030 --> 06:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
segregated out or compiled in any way
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to know how to address
 
06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
it and how to move forward so that's
 
06:12:04.670 --> 06:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
where the the rationale behind the bill
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
came from as you'll see we're still
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
waiting for a fiscal note I did request
 
06:12:10.990 --> 06:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note I knew to request a fiscal
 
06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
note I requested the fiscal note in
 
06:12:14.990 --> 06:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
September um hopefully we'll get the
 
06:12:18.030 --> 06:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note soon um but I obviously I
 
06:12:20.230 --> 06:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
can't make the fiscal note happen sooner
 
06:12:23.070 --> 06:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't have it um but that's
 
06:12:24.788 --> 06:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
where that's where the rationale for all
 
06:12:26.190 --> 06:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
of this came from and then just if I
 
06:12:28.030 --> 06:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
could read one
 
06:12:30.190 --> 06:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
comment um from another parent who
 
06:12:32.910 --> 06:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
reached out to me um she said I'm a
 
06:12:34.788 --> 06:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
parent of a public school students and a
 
06:12:36.510 --> 06:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
member of my District School Board the
 
06:12:38.548 --> 06:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint is mine alone but we need
 
06:12:40.270 --> 06:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
stronger reporting enforcement and
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
clarification of anti-bullying policy
 
06:12:44.670 --> 06:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
and procedures to help guide and support
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
efforts by school districts to
 
06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately address and mitigate
 
06:12:50.230 --> 06:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
incidents at schools requiring specific
 
06:12:52.430 --> 06:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
reporting standards will help districts
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
form appropriate policies and procedures
 
06:12:56.788 --> 06:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
to respond proactively rather than
 
06:12:58.430 --> 06:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
reactively to bullying and cyber
 
06:13:00.190 --> 06:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
bullying and this parent obviously
 
06:13:02.670 --> 06:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
supports the intent of the bill so and
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
again I'm open to amending it as we work
 
06:13:08.310 --> 06:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
on our subcommittee or our special
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
Workshop thank you very much
 
06:13:10.080 --> 06:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
Workshop thank you very much
representative

06:13:12.070 --> 06:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent dry thank you and
 
06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question first I
 
06:13:18.270 --> 06:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
just need to clarify you said there's a
 
06:13:19.548 --> 06:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
difference between a hate crime and a
 
06:13:21.788 --> 06:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
hateful act and I didn't catch the
 
06:13:23.510 --> 06:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
difference right
 
06:13:23.520 --> 06:13:25.548 align:start position:0%
difference right
so

06:13:25.548 --> 06:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:28.190 --> 06:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
um freedom of speech
 
06:13:32.430 --> 06:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
laws allow people to use very what we
 
06:13:34.350 --> 06:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
would consider very hateful words
 
06:13:34.360 --> 06:13:38.270 align:start position:0%
would consider very hateful words
legally

06:13:38.270 --> 06:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:40.270 --> 06:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
if they use those words in a way that is
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
specifically threatening someone you
 
06:13:44.350 --> 06:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
know like I'm going to kill you because
 
06:13:47.468 --> 06:13:47.478 align:start position:0%
you're a fill-in the blank that becomes
 
06:13:50.190 --> 06:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
a hate crime because it's actually the
 
06:13:51.510 --> 06:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
threat of
 
06:13:54.110 --> 06:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
assault that is the
 
06:13:58.190 --> 06:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
crime um and it adds based on Federal
 
06:14:00.868 --> 06:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
and State law there's because it uses a
 
06:14:02.830 --> 06:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
targeted language or targets a
 
06:14:05.350 --> 06:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
particular group that makes it a hate
 
06:14:08.110 --> 06:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
crime rather than just a an assault
 
06:14:08.120 --> 06:14:09.670 align:start position:0%
crime rather than just a an assault
right

06:14:09.670 --> 06:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
um but drawing swastikas on uh property
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
the crime is graffiti but the swastika
 
06:14:17.120 --> 06:14:18.628 align:start position:0%
the crime is graffiti but the swastika
is

06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:14:22.150 --> 06:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
not the hate is is the is
 
06:14:24.910 --> 06:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
not right does that make I know it's
 
06:14:27.430 --> 06:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's so nuanced and ultimately I would I
 
06:14:30.230 --> 06:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
can find the presentation um attorney
 
06:14:32.350 --> 06:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
lock sent us which was as I said he
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
spent 40 minutes explaining all the
 
06:14:36.990 --> 06:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
different nuances and technicalities and
 
06:14:39.750 --> 06:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
it was a lot um but it's there's a
 
06:14:41.670 --> 06:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
really fine line before something is
 
06:14:44.708 --> 06:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
elevated to a hate crime um and that's
 
06:14:47.190 --> 06:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
actually by State Statute it's an add-on
 
06:14:49.070 --> 06:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
to an existing crime it's not a crime on
 
06:14:52.510 --> 06:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
its own whereas a hateful Act is a
 
06:14:55.350 --> 06:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
generally accepted term
 
06:14:58.750 --> 06:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay um so I I see that you want to
 
06:15:00.150 --> 06:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
maybe submit things to the ATT of
 
06:15:02.190 --> 06:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
General's office of civil rights is
 
06:15:04.590 --> 06:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
there nothing in that has schools
 
06:15:06.590 --> 06:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
already doing that you think that that
 
06:15:08.270 --> 06:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
would be a place that they would send
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
these things not unless it elevates to
 
06:15:11.948 --> 06:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
the point of a police involved
 
06:15:15.990 --> 06:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and so um if an incident
 
06:15:17.708 --> 06:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
Rises to the level that the police are
 
06:15:21.070 --> 06:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
brought in to investigate then either
 
06:15:25.150 --> 06:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
the town or the county or the state AG
 
06:15:28.510 --> 06:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
would be involved in that process but
 
06:15:33.150 --> 06:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge for um part of the
 
06:15:35.788 --> 06:15:35.798 align:start position:0%
reason for wanting to send the the
 
06:15:37.548 --> 06:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
compile data to the AG's office is
 
06:15:39.830 --> 06:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
really to be looking at Trends so for
 
06:15:42.590 --> 06:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
example we know we have some groups that
 
06:15:45.430 --> 06:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
have um like you know we have a friend
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
who likes to send me what I offer to as
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
Love Letters from his white supremacy
 
06:15:51.990 --> 06:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
organization to tell me how much he Ador
 
06:15:56.510 --> 06:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
me um and my policies um and
 
06:15:59.548 --> 06:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
um he he walks that line very carefully
 
06:16:01.468 --> 06:16:01.478 align:start position:0%
so that it's not the level of hate crime
 
06:16:03.270 --> 06:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a crime what he sends to
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
me um it's certainly hateful language
 
06:16:07.350 --> 06:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
and hateful
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
comments um and I'm not the only one who
 
06:16:13.628 --> 06:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
gets his love letters um to be truthful
 
06:16:13.638 --> 06:16:14.830 align:start position:0%
gets his love letters um to be truthful
so

06:16:14.830 --> 06:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:17.788 --> 06:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
um but if we know that we have one of
 
06:16:20.548 --> 06:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
these groups that sort of seems to be
 
06:16:22.150 --> 06:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
growing in a particular part of the
 
06:16:24.830 --> 06:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
state and we're seeing a corresponding
 
06:16:26.708 --> 06:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
number of incidents in that school
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
district we might know about refocusing
 
06:16:32.150 --> 06:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
some of the instruction or some of the
 
06:16:34.270 --> 06:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
policies we're doing in that District
 
06:16:36.070 --> 06:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's really about trying to look for the
 
06:16:39.548 --> 06:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
trends right and so if we know that
 
06:16:43.110 --> 06:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
Oyster River has 2,000 incidents in you
 
06:16:46.468 --> 06:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
know a year and that conquered has zero
 
06:16:48.510 --> 06:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
incidents so first of all is conquered
 
06:16:50.910 --> 06:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
reporting accurately but if they are
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
what are they doing that's so successful
 
06:16:55.390 --> 06:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
at avoiding these incidents and what's
 
06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
happening in Oyster River not just
 
06:16:59.430 --> 06:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
within the schools but within the
 
06:17:01.270 --> 06:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
community that they may need to take a
 
06:17:03.590 --> 06:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
deeper look at right maybe there's a
 
06:17:06.670 --> 06:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
group that's been growing there and and
 
06:17:08.030 --> 06:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
to be fair that's not what's actually
 
06:17:09.788 --> 06:17:09.798 align:start position:0%
happening in Oyster River I'm just using
 
06:17:12.070 --> 06:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
my own District so as not to impune any
 
06:17:13.788 --> 06:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
other District but our district is
 
06:17:16.948 --> 06:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
working hard albeit not always as
 
06:17:20.190 --> 06:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
accurately as I might prefer thank
 
06:17:23.468 --> 06:17:23.478 align:start position:0%
you yes represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
06:17:24.868 --> 06:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you again for bringing
 
06:17:27.230 --> 06:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
this forward you mentioned speaking with
 
06:17:29.868 --> 06:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
the Department about this bill and I
 
06:17:31.150 --> 06:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
understand there isn't a fiscal note so
 
06:17:33.948 --> 06:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
the cost for this is unknown however I
 
06:17:36.310 --> 06:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
know in my own speaking with the doe
 
06:17:38.590 --> 06:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
whenever we have something new for them
 
06:17:40.390 --> 06:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
to do in this bill they would have to
 
06:17:43.350 --> 06:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
report data and have it on a website and
 
06:17:46.788 --> 06:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
it seems a little bit um prescriptive
 
06:17:48.190 --> 06:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
all the things that have to
 
06:17:50.670 --> 06:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
do has a doe mentioned that they'd have
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
to have a new person to do this or hire
 
06:17:54.788 --> 06:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
a new staff person to do this so
 
06:17:55.990 --> 06:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
technically they're supposed to be
 
06:17:58.990 --> 06:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring this already and they have a
 
06:18:02.030 --> 06:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
website that's supposed to be tracking
 
06:18:05.110 --> 06:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
this information when we asked about who
 
06:18:07.670 --> 06:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
was responsible for actually following
 
06:18:09.150 --> 06:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
up and making sure school districts
 
06:18:11.390 --> 06:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
provided information or who made sure
 
06:18:13.390 --> 06:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
things were uploaded the representative
 
06:18:15.230 --> 06:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
who attended our meetings had no
 
06:18:18.750 --> 06:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
information um so uh it became
 
06:18:22.110 --> 06:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
prescriptive because we felt if you know
 
06:18:23.910 --> 06:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
when we discussed this as a committee we
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
were like okay well someone The Buck has
 
06:18:29.310 --> 06:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
to stop somewhere yes right and if
 
06:18:30.990 --> 06:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're already supposed to be compiling
 
06:18:33.548 --> 06:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
the data and they're not following
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
through the way that they need to be
 
06:18:36.670 --> 06:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to be more specific about
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
how they compile it and that's part of
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
the reason for them having specific
 
06:18:42.670 --> 06:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
reporting out process and a timeline
 
06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
right is to say okay you got this much
 
06:18:47.070 --> 06:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
time to figure it out
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
but let's let's get it if I may have a
 
06:18:51.910 --> 06:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
followup yes and I imagine how
 
06:18:53.910 --> 06:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
disappointed it is to ask a question and
 
06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
the answer can't be provided for
 
06:18:57.390 --> 06:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason is um my other
 
06:19:00.030 --> 06:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
question is a bit of little unrelated
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned protected classes
 
06:19:06.030 --> 06:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
beginning in line 11 and generally
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm sure we can all name what
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
the protected classes are but there are
 
06:19:11.070 --> 06:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
VAR definitions depending on what law
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at so is there a specific
 
06:19:15.230 --> 06:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
definition of which protected classes
 
06:19:16.868 --> 06:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
that we're referring to is it a federal
 
06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
statute that's not referenced here so I
 
06:19:21.310 --> 06:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
was looking at State statutes and I was
 
06:19:23.030 --> 06:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the information provided by
 
06:19:24.990 --> 06:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
attorney lock about what protected
 
06:19:27.430 --> 06:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
classes are subject to the hate crime
 
06:19:30.590 --> 06:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
statutes in our state okay and would you
 
06:19:33.230 --> 06:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
think that we should specify the RSA in
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
here is there any added benefit to doing
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
that from what the attorney said I'm not
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
sure um we we could certainly do that
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
and when we have our further discussion
 
06:19:42.310 --> 06:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to reach out and get
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
additional information to make sure that
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
I have that specific information for you
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay and if I may ask one more question
 
06:19:52.110 --> 06:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
um the conclusion of my questions is
 
06:19:55.948 --> 06:19:55.958 align:start position:0%
looking on beginning section um line
 
06:20:00.030 --> 06:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
nine to line 10 really when you change
 
06:20:02.910 --> 06:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
each school um district and chartered
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
public school to every school that
 
06:20:06.910 --> 06:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
receive state funding my immediate
 
06:20:08.548 --> 06:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
thought is what is the impact of this on
 
06:20:12.070 --> 06:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
our EFA program and our EFA students so
 
06:20:13.590 --> 06:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
I would hope that students who are
 
06:20:15.788 --> 06:20:15.798 align:start position:0%
attending any school including the
 
06:20:17.750 --> 06:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
schools that receive EFA funding that
 
06:20:19.390 --> 06:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
those schools would also be reporting
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
bullying and uh hate incidents to the
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
state so that we can track them if for
 
06:20:28.990 --> 06:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
example we discover that the Black
 
06:20:33.190 --> 06:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
Bottle school has you know 15 students
 
06:20:35.590 --> 06:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and has 12 bullying
 
06:20:38.548 --> 06:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
incidents maybe we should be looking at
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's an appropriate
 
06:20:41.910 --> 06:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
place for EFA funds to be able to be
 
06:20:44.510 --> 06:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
directed or if there's you know so
 
06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
really it's about trying to find where
 
06:20:49.750 --> 06:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
things are happening so that we can
 
06:20:51.430 --> 06:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
figure out ways of addressing it all
 
06:20:51.440 --> 06:21:00.830 align:start position:0%
figure out ways of addressing it all
right

06:21:00.830 --> 06:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:03.548 --> 06:21:03.558 align:start position:0%
thanks further
 
06:21:06.990 --> 06:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions seen none thank you very much
 
06:21:08.868 --> 06:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else who wanted to
 
06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:12.320 --> 06:21:13.868 align:start position:0%
