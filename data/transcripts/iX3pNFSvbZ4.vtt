00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
I think one o'clock we'll start on work
 
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.369 align:start position:0%
I think one o'clock we'll start on work
session

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
okay we're talking about timing
 
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
and having uh
 
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh agencies back in for further budget
 
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.330 align:start position:0%
uh agencies back in for further budget
review

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
just off the top of your head
 
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh as a hip shot where are we for
 
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
agencies where there's Comfort level or
 
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's not Comfort level
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I had and of course I haven't got
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
any guidance yet about what what are we
 
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
going to do because we're off
 
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
with the with the governor's budget
 
00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
an accrual of about 90 million dollars
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
we maybe we get to scheduling after I do
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
have this packet that I handed out here
 
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
today and this will what I've done is
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
tried to compile everything that the
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
agencies have asked for everything in
 
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 all of our bills so maybe
 
00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
once we see these specific subject
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
matters that we still have to get
 
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
through that may decide how much time we
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
need with who okay uh oh this is both
 
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
this is all divisions so that yet so I
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
gave I gave out an index that has uh all
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
of the sections for the entirety of
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. so that's the stapled uh
 
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
landscape uh right oriented document so
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's really just a reference document
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
for for anyone who just wants to find a
 
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
section quick uh as far as division two
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
Focus work there's another packet here
 
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
with a binder clip on it
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
so this one here just has house division
 
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
two sections so
 
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
I can walk us through real briefly I
 
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
don't want to dive into every subject
 
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
matter but at least uh this is kind of a
 
00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 align:start position:0%
catch-all of everything we've identified
 
00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 align:start position:0%
is going to be referred to division two
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
so the first two things are are very
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
easy house bill one so in the back of
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
house bill one we have some what we
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
usually refer to as boilerplate language
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
so Lottery Commission has authority to
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
buy uh their ticket Supply in the back
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
of Hospital one it's been there for
 
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
decades really just a rubber stamp okay
 
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
to continue that
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
and then positions abolish is always in
 
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
the back of house bill one any old
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
positions that the agencies don't need
 
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
any longer they just get wiped out so
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
those two sections
 
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.890 align:start position:0%
those two sections
um

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
at some point we'll do an affirmative
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
vote in the committee just to be okay
 
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
with that we haven't heard anything from
 
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
the agencies that need any changes to
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
those so you're probably good to go with
 
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.909 align:start position:0%
those so you're probably good to go with
those

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
jumping into house bill too we've got a
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
lot of House Bill too this year compared
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
to the last couple so I'll go through
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
them very quickly uh we talked about
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment the
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
governor did provide some funding and
 
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 relative to that as well as
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
the program change to that which was
 
00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
allowing for more courses to be offered
 
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
per student we also heard from the
 
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
community college system that they put
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
forth a section in House Bill 2 uh
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
changing the retirement system
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility for employees hired after
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024.
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh we heard about the Appropriations for
 
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
UNH the interoperability lab as well as
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
the Whittemore Center
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
both of those Appropriations and I tried
 
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
to indicate on here
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
there's some Appropriations that are in
 
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
24 some in 25 and then there's also many
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
appropriations of using fiscal 23 what
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
we call them Surplus dollars if you will
 
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
so those would be a hit to the general
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
fund before this current fiscal year
 
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.629 align:start position:0%
fund before this current fiscal year
ends

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah around the Whittemore Center the
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
funds of 2023 which is now
 
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
um clearly they're not going to be
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
starting construction anytime soon so
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
um why would it need to be in 2023 as
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to could we put it in 2024 or I
 
00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 align:start position:0%
know you know UNH has said this will
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
help them leverage many of millions of
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
dollars to get to the final the the
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
um total amount so it was putting it
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
into 2023 a way of helping them or
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
what's it's a way of eating up uh
 
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 align:start position:0%
Surplus I couldn't think of the word
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it does it does include non-lapsing
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
language so it'll be available for them
 
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
when they are ready to spend it but
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
under current law uh at the end of every
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
biennium any unexpended general funds
 
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
would go to the rainy day fund so this
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
is essentially using the general funds
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
available in the state budget in 23
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
before the close of the biennium Mary
 
00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
are they General funds or are they
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
education trust funds uh General funds
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I do have uh Appropriations later on
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
on this list and I did indicate which
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna fly through these uh
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a repeal of the advanced
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing education advisory Council
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
there's also changes to the higher
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the scholarship
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
trust fund the unique program and for
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
those who have been on this committee
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
before there's been proposals in the
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
past relative to the regenerative
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing debt relief program the
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
governor's House Bill 2 introduced
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
includes an expansion of that program
 
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
which is administered by the business
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority with a revenue stream
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
from the uh unique uh the uh higher
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so there's quite a
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
few pages in House Bill 2 relative to
 
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
this and we'll hear from
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
possibly someone from treasury business
 
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority we should probably
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
invite in as well as perhaps someone
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office to explain uh
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
the basis for it as well as uh you'll
 
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
probably hear from University system on
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
this one as well
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
the next set there's a few uh
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
Appropriations as well as a position
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
established and a new uh
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
program relative to computer science and
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
stem administered by the departions with
 
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
them and and learn more and you'll see
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
there's about a five million
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation into this computer science
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
program that's non-lapsing that's a
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
charge against fiscal 23 funds
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
we did hear from the Department of
 
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
Safety that the governor's house bill to
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
included a million dollars for the body
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
Cam and dashboard camera fund and that
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
again is a charge to fiscal 23.
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
um there's in-house Bill 2 it
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
establishes a commission relative to New
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics and appropriates two
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the development of a
 
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
textbook a Civics text textbook again A
 
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
charged to 23 funds
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh 250 000 appropriated to the
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Education relative to the
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year program and that's
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there is some uh private
 
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
funds that do come in this would be a
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
significant increase I believe I'd have
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
to double check what the historical
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
funding level has been we heard from the
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety relative to the
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program there's
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
a dedicated Fund in house bill to
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
establish as well as an appropriation of
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
about 100 1.4 million dollars
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation has quite a
 
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation has quite a
few

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
few
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
statutory changes that vary across a few
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
subject matters uh that I I don't
 
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily believe have a super direct
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
budgetary impact but we probably would
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
want to invite them in to to walk us
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
through these we'll probably have other
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
items to discuss with them anyways I
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
will pause there and just say I don't
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
know what the overall plan is there's
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
been years where the division has worked
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
through these sections with the agencies
 
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
there's been years where for instance
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
these dot sections would go down to
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways and they would
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
decide what to do with them since they
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
do have some policy involved I don't
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
know what the chairs in mind with that
 
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:42.500 align:start position:0%
chair Weiler so
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
at the very least they will eventually
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
come back here for a final up or down or
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do but I don't know
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
if the policy committees are going to
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
well when we had
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
the last time the governor gave us a
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
really big list of kind of
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
things that nobody really ever asked for
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
but we're in hb2 we kind of went through
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
it and just eliminated them those that
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
we thought were unnecessary and then we
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
um had that much more money to use for
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's something we
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
and certainly just like any Bill uh all
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
of these sections are subject to
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment deletion you know whatever
 
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
Amendment deletion you know whatever
um

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
and it'll be up to the committee how you
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
want to handle
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to just pick on one for
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
instance the new ham the UNH
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab appropriation
 
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
I always like it I think I always think
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's neat and tidy when the committee
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
will vote to yes we vote to keep that in
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
you know have an affirmative vote to
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
keep that in uh if
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have a vote to delete it and
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
you don't have a positive vote to to
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
keep it in I don't know maybe the almost
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
like a we established the rule I guess
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
how we're going to handle a section like
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
that say we have a tie vote and just for
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we'll committee okay so
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
so we would go to full and I expect the
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
other divisions are going to try to work
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
through how to handle those situations
 
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
if we always have an odd number of of
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
members voting we it shouldn't be an
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
issue but I was thinking if we happen to
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
have a day and we end up with a three
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
three or a 4-4 tie what happens to that
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
section does it stay in the bill or does
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
it you know so that's I'm just tossing
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
that out there because normally it would
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
that would indicate it lost a tie but in
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
this particular case I think it
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
indicates it goes to the full function
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
it would remain in the in the bill
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
because it's in there as introduced
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what our thought was but
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that's clear
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
and known to everyone as we proceed Mary
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with that
 
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.509 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with that
okay

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
you know like a leader and talk about
 
00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:58.730 align:start position:0%
you know like a leader and talk about
until

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
so someone can I can get some if we're
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
gonna if we're gonna vote yeah that's
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
so jumping down so I do have all the
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
page numbers the page numbers should
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
align to House Bill 2 the section
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
numbers will align
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
um as well the next section we heard
 
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety relative
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
to the auxiliary State Police Force so
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's a statute that limits that Force
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
to 16 uh folks 50 16 persons and this
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
removes that cap allowing the the forest
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
to be uh I guess within however many
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
positions they can fill at their
 
00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:34.019 align:start position:0%
budgeted levels
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
we had heard from the Department of
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
Safety relative to changing the
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
statutory fee for the motor vehicle
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
records to be fee amounts set through
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
administrative rule so you'll see that
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
section 149 and then as well as the
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
ability for the Department to uh
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
provide driver records upon requests to
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
Federal entities within certain
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
parameters which was in line with what
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
they do for non-federal or
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
um but those two things this is an
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to raise their
 
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.850 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to raise their
rates

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity for them to set the
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
fee in statute all right rules sorry I
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
recall whatever we were discussing
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
stayed with us but because there was a
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
potential of additional Revenue there
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
was a discussion about whether it needs
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
to go to Ways and Means so does that not
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
pertain here because it may be an
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
increase and that would be up to again
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
if the committee as a whole is going to
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
decide to parse out Pro uh sections for
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
the policy committees to review I will
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
say I think we had heard from the
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
Department that some of their budget is
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
built on the assumption that they would
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
be raising these fees through rules
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
next we had heard from the Department of
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
Safety relative to the fire marshal
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
doing the inspection of the residential
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
care and health facilities if you recall
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
they'd mentioned the governor's budget
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
removed positions at the Department of
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services changed the
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility to safety but those
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
positions were not added at safety and
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
that was their top prioritized need was
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
to get those two general funded
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
positions and we'll get to that later
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
and uh this afternoon I've got a page
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Safety had a position
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
established within the fire Mark or the
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
fire safety office this is a different
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
position to the inspectors
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's two reoccurring uh sections that
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past relative
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety providing them the
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
authority to fill unfunded positions so
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
in the state budget each unique position
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
number is either funded or it's not
 
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.389 align:start position:0%
number is either funded or it's not
funded

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
this would give the department a safety
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
flexibility that if they had money in
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
their budget elsewhere they could fill
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
and fund one of those unfunded positions
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
but they still could stay with they'd
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
have to stay within their budgeted
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
amounts that would only be for two years
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
it's biennial yeah and same thing with
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to create a full-time
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
on the next page the continuation of the
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
Granite Shield program is an
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation of just over 1.2 million
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
dollars in each fiscal 24 and 25.
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
we had heard from the Department of
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
Safety that there would be some sections
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
in the house bill too relative to uh
 
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
emergency medical care providers
 
00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:23.150 align:start position:0%
emergency medical care providers
um

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
the suspension of RSA 99b this is the we
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
refer to them as the Weiler caps on
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
Highway funds the department had
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
requested that that statute be suspended
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
as essentially a belt and suspenders my
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
rough estimates are they are in
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
compliance and the suspension of this
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
law is not necessary but as we finalize
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
all our work I'll make sure that we
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
either are compliant or that suspension
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
is considered if you need it but I don't
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
think you're going to need that yeah
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just a quick
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
question I'm really not familiar with
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
that particular statue that they're
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
looking to suspending do you have a
 
00:15:59.889 --> 00:15:59.899 align:start position:0%
15-20 second summary of what it says
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
essentially says of all the Gross Road
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
toll and motor vehicle Revenue collected
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
by the state certain amounts have to be
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated to Dot and certain amounts
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed non-dot agencies got it
 
00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed non-dot agencies got it
thanks

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
next we had heard from Department of
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
Safety relative to the state and local
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
cyber security grant program is uh about
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars 2.9 over the
 
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
biennium appropriated for that purpose
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
and Department of Safety has a three and
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
a half million dollar appropriation of
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 funds for the purchase of 52
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
state police cruisers so this year
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety did have quite a
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
few so I would expect we would want them
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
back to go into detail uh Steve Lavoy
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
and commissioner Quinn had gone through
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
these at high level when they were in
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
with us last week but I think diving a
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper now that we have House
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 text maybe appropriate at a
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
future a work session
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
then we get into mostly education from
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
here on out uh there's sections relative
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
to expanding the definition of an
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
eligible student for Education Freedom
 
00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:05.689 align:start position:0%
eligible student for Education Freedom
accounts

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
uh and you'll also know that you know or
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware there's a couple
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
bills flying around including a couple
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
on uh this week's
 
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339 align:start position:0%
um this Thursday's yeah this Thursday's
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
uh house floor there's there's a couple
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
of bills relative to EFA eligibility so
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
depending on what
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
um happens as a house position
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably all you don't
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
want to pass anything conflicting so we
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we at least
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
capture whatever the the decision is and
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419 align:start position:0%
um multiple pieces of legislation that
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
can flick pass
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
similarly there's a bill on the the
 
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
floor uh Thursday relative to the
 
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:45.140 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and allowable uses
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
also including uh allowing the
 
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to retain some
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
of it for administration and that is
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
also in house bill 2. so similarly
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee wants to do with
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
that from a policy position that bill
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 2 kind of do the same but
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
slightly different things so we'd want
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
to make sure we unify uh whatever the
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
policy is you want to move forward with
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard about the school building
 
00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
Aid fund and this house bill 2 includes
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
a 75 million dollar transfer from the
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to the school
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
building Aid fund it's called but that
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
transfer would occur 30 June 2025
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
essentially allocating money for next
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
biennium it's spent in this budget but
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't actually be provided in aid
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
until 26 and 27 presumably
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
you've got to walk me through that one
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
one more time sure so uh so in in-house
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 yeah there's a transfer of 75
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
million dollars it hits fiscal 25 but
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
the transfer is set to occur on June 30
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
the last day of the biennium so it's
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
spent in this budget but it's really
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
because it is only there for the last
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
day of the biennium it's intended to be
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
expended next biennium so it's a charge
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
against this budget but kind of planned
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
on for probably a way to take a
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
excess what's the word again we lost it
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
sir yes it's a way to take Surplus and
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
put it in a future by any essentially
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
yep okay yeah that makes sense so it
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
essentially earmarks 75 million dollars
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
from this year's education this
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
biennium's education trust fund for
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
school building Aid payments for next
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
biennium but it does not make this
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
year's education uh building fund 75
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
million no there is some money in in
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
here relative to new projects for 24 and
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
25 but that 75 would be for the next
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
buying okay and this also the discussion
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
around this is whether or not
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
this is appropriate to take out of the
 
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah this would be I think the third
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
budget in a row that we've started to
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
use education trust fund for school
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
building Aid okay
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
uh next there's a section relative to
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
court ordered payments Court I say court
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
ordered payments it should be court
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
order placement payments and special
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
education to also be used for the
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
education trust fund I have a schedule
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund in this
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
pack and we'll I'll point out there's a
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
few new programs that are being charged
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
for that fund that are unusual so this
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
is the authority and law to to make that
 
00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:19.850 align:start position:0%
is the authority and law to to make that
permissible

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
currently it's General funds and this
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
would just make it so it's education
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
trust funds that's the only change here
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
right I think that legislation I may
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
have been a co-sponsor on and uh it's
 
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's basically a form of an unfunded
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
mandate where we you know require
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
certain things but we don't pay for it
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
so we need to fix that and we can get to
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
it when we get to more and we do have a
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
bill I think tomorrow on our slate for
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
tomorrow relative to episode of
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
treatments being included into what the
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
state's paying for yeah so that's the
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill I was talking about so this is not
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
that never mind this is just changing
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
the color of the money essentially of
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
oh let's see where are we next is the uh
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
CTE the Career and Technical education
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
program so historically those funds
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
would be House Bill 25 capital budget
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the renovation or construction of CT
 
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.950 align:start position:0%
for the renovation or construction of CT
centers

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh the governor has proposed 12 and a
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
half million dollars for the Sugar Hill
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
River Valley Regional tech center uh to
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
come from the education trust fund so
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the capital budget
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
for CT renovation it's all essentially
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget and there's
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 language changing the
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
statute so this would essentially be an
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh operating budget expense no
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
the next one two three four five six
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
seven or so sections rows on here are
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
all different components of the
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended changes to the
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
adequate education formula so we heard
 
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
from the Department last week Mark
 
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:55.700 align:start position:0%
walked us through the spreadsheet uh
 
00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of options here
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee wants to do when
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
it comes to education funding we have a
 
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that I think we have
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
scheduled for work session tomorrow that
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
pass education in the house and have
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
been referred to us relative to changing
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
the education funding formula so
 
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
that's it's the biggest line item in the
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
budget and um It's usually the one of
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
the heavier lifts for division two
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
deciding where you want to go with Ed
 
00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:22.549 align:start position:0%
deciding where you want to go with Ed
funding

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
so jumping down page 68 section 177
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
there's a repeal of the third grade
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
reading Statewide uh Assessment program
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
data and my my suspicion is this is
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
relative to getting rid of the third
 
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
grade reading component of the ad Ed
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
funding that we touched upon earlier
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a change in a chapter law that
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
was passed two years ago relative to
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
this state's ability to stay compliant
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
with maintenance of equity when it came
 
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
to federal funds there's a reference
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
added to include charter schools into
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
that determination so we might be able
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
to might be able to ask the department
 
00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
the necessity for that
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
and then the last two things on here the
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
governor's proposed changing the Revenue
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
allocations for business profits and
 
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:10.340 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
simplifying how those are determined but
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
it does shift more Revenue to the
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
general fund from the education trust
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
fund and I have a schedule showing that
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
later on
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
so this this document I'm going to keep
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
track as we go along in this far right
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
column the action so it could be we take
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
a vote to accept it it could be we take
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
a vote to delete it because you don't
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
agree with it or if there's an amendment
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
to alter it in any way I would have an
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
amendment number carried in here based
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
on something we've drafted and voted on
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to track all of our changes
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2 on this and I'll try to
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
update this every time we meet you so
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
everyone knows where we're at and then
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
down below on the second page that's
 
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
open for anything a new section of House
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 if anything comes along that's
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
not relative to what's in the bill is
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
introduce something new that doesn't
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a corresponding section I would
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
list them down there
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are with House Bill
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
2. I know I went through that very
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
quickly and you know when you look at
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
the number of pages and and the the uh
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
the content that's behind them it's
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
probably gonna take a little bit longer
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
to work through them with the agencies
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially the long
 
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:19.220 align:start position:0%
Insurance just going out to the agencies
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh they uh House Bill 2 went out was
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
published last week and they should be
 
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539 align:start position:0%
familiar with what is in there it was
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
not this document here that we're
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
walking through is online right now okay
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
so when when anyone does come in I'll
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
make sure they're we're all working from
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
the same okay same place would be
 
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.149 align:start position:0%
the same okay same place would be
helpful

00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
any questions with House Bill 2
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
beside I mean as far as as far as that
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
let me say any questions with Hospital 2
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
so the next page looks like this way
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
more numbers way more cells so this is
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
just I've compiled all of the agency's
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
requests that you heard uh their
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs any technical changes
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
that were brought forward there's a
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
couple things on here that actually uh
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
were brought to my attention after the
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
agency came in
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
but I listed them on here just so if we
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
have follow-up with the agencies it'll
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
it'll all be compiled
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I or I sorted them by agency so the
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety goes all the way
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
down until row 28 and you'll notice on
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
rows 27 and 28 there's some shading
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
there so I've shaded what we've
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
tentatively approved this was their uh
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
they had brought forward some technical
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
Corrections they needed so
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I'll shade any items that we approve
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
between uh now and when we get when
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're complete just so we can keep track
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
of that uh fishing game it had some
 
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:54.740 align:start position:0%
requests transportation
 
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.330 align:start position:0%
requests transportation
education

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.250 align:start position:0%
education
Lottery

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.470 align:start position:0%
Lottery
um

00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
ccsnh usnh and police standards which we
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
did the police standards one as well
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
but this is essentially changes that
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
would impact
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
pretty sure everything in here would
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
impact House Bill won so our operating
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
budget document so if any of these we
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
can that the committee supports I would
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
make the data entry changes into house
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah other you know just I just
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
gotta turn your mic and that's exactly
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say uh I've been
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
watching these online and when you don't
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
key in on the mic and I notice you did
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
it also it doesn't come out and if you
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
might have something important to say
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's important everybody so if you
 
00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:47.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
the question is not the problem
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
so looking at this with the totals at
 
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh there isn't there a grand tone no I
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't total this up this is
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
over and above the governor's budget so
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
anything on here is the change to the
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so yeah these would
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
all be increases too
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
well since we're since our revenues are
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
less than the governors
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
these aren't going to happen unless we
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
knock something else out to replace it
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
correct essentially so yeah so we'll
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
we'll probably put together a document
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of higher level with the
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
general fund picture now that Ways and
 
00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:33.539 align:start position:0%
Means has some revenues approved they
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
did come in less than the governor's uh
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
estimates so that will impact
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
um some of the
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
priorities the governor had as far as
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
how much money goes to the rainy day
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
fund or how much money is left over in
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund uh and that
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
that's up to the committee to decide
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
from a policy position how much you want
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
to spend and and whether you want to
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
stay within certain Revenue parameters
 
00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
or have a certain amount go to the rainy
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
day fund there's a lot of big pieces I
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
would probably have to be established to
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
know if you and division two could
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
afford some of these things right okay
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
so but right now they're on in the wings
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
I would say it probably would require a
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
little bit of coordination across all
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
three divisions to know kind of where
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
you're at
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
but let me pick on Cahill I I just have
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
to notice on the top of the second page
 
00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:23.769 align:start position:0%
to notice on the top of the second page
uh

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:23.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
oh that's his back that that that's his
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
pointing to re retroactive okay yeah and
 
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.930 align:start position:0%
pointing to re retroactive okay yeah and
and

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
hang with me I'm hoping all of these
 
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:42.380 align:start position:0%
numbers are accurate so I tried to
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
reconcile so a lot of these bills when
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
we do the fiscal notes we do them based
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
on current law but I tried to update the
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
amounts here to be reflective of the
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so not so when you
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
when you look at these numbers it's
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
really how much would you have to add to
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget okay for school
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
building aid for instance not counting
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
that 75 million the operating budget
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
includes additional funds for our
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
project this would be the net above and
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
beyond that so they're a little bit if
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
you looked at the fiscal notes of these
 
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
bills they'd be more expensive than what
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
you see here because the governor
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
already covered some of it in in this
 
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.010 align:start position:0%
already covered some of it in in this
document

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
so so yeah I've got the bills on the
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
next page listed uh
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've got you know 10 or so bills that
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
we've already retained we've got 10 or
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
more so I think 10 for tomorrow that
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're also going to consider there's a
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that I I don't have a
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis for and I'm probably not
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
going to have one what are you looking
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
at I'm sorry the second page of that
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
okay if you flip over where the bills
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
feel pretty confident with the ones that
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
we've retained as far as the estimates
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
to do with that down below where we've
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
got the pending which is the bills we
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
have scheduled for tomorrow
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
can I I just mention about
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 601 you've got a fiscal
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
um expectation there and in fact if that
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
were to be put into
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
our law or the authority given to the
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed that could not go into
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
effect until
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
um 2026 because right now we couldn't
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
even apply for it so I don't know if
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate what we're looking for
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
is the authorization it doesn't need to
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
be any money
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
for the adequacy or right so the impact
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
of the Ed funding amounts that wouldn't
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
kick in until 26. yes for some of the
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
nutrition areas of for the estate match
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
we do for meals and the department said
 
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
they would need a position so those
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
costs reflect
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
um more Administration that's not
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
relative to what would increase in the
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula the kind of a bigger
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
number we're expecting to see for the
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director that wouldn't hit and
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
change the adequacy until fiscal 26. so
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
you're right on that so these were just
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
other costs the department identified to
 
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:00.980 align:start position:0%
implement thank you
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
just a quick note while we are talking
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
about various bills I'm looking at hb129
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
hygiene product in schools
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
um I think that while I believe that
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
that bill you know
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
needs to address a you know unfunded
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
mandate mandate
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
I think we can probably Tinker with a
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
bill to significantly reduce the
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and still meet the actual
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
mandate uh you know expectations so
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
while we talk about certain things that
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
may or may not happen you know uh I
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be at this level
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know I want to see significantly
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
lower amounts but as long as we have a
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
mandate we gotta pay something
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
to defray those you know scores but I
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
would say it should be significantly
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
less than it is right now yeah and I
 
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:52.100 align:start position:0%
think along with that I think
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
in the bill is presented it had
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
retroactive payments and I think we
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the original actor we can
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
figure the details out but and that's
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
something you can decide Mr chair how
 
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
you want to proceed if we get to you
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
know we've got all these bills if you
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a open dialogue or if
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
anyone wanted to come in with a separate
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment work I could work on an
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendment bring something in that does
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
any of these changes you're thinking
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's up to the committee and how you
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
want to proceed but any of those bills
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
and the spending ones especially which
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
is most of the ones we've retained
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
um we would have to draft a house bill
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
to Amendment right so
 
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.610 align:start position:0%
to Amendment right so
um

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know we can either do that as a
 
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
group or if any individual member wants
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
to work with me and do an amendment just
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
the question because you know I'm new to
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
all this we have a very limited amount
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
of time and it takes time to get to the
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
OLS I just want to stay that personally
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
I would feel that the best way to
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
approach these situations would be to
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
you know discuss as a committee whether
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
certain changes to a bill may be
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not without drafting a
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
full Amendment on a simple bills at
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
least like this and if we reach an
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
agreement in committee then we can just
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
draft the amendment we agreed to you
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
know and formally approve it rather than
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
prepare five different scenarios burden
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
owls burden Mickey
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
some bills may require that if they are
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
complex enough you need to see the
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
language but for really simple stuff
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
like that I'd appreciate you know more
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
relaxed process if it meets everybody
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
else's expectations
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
well we
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
we can decide what we want to do
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to move forward on that on
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
the hygiene products
 
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:33.380 align:start position:0%
take the original bill as offered
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
uh reduce the the annual to three
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
dollars instead of twelve dollars
 
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.970 align:start position:0%
dollars instead of twelve dollars
uh

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
drop the retroactive payment
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
and take out girl and put in
 
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
is that everybody comfortable with that
 
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.409 align:start position:0%
is that everybody comfortable with that
one

00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay actually you'd have to also take
 
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
out eight there is an age
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
um limit there I would suggest removing
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
the agent if you are staying
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
menstruating student or person or what
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
no that takes care of you you don't need
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
an aged definition
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
I don't have the bill in front of me but
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we needed to to Define
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
in some way
 
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
the population that the department would
 
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate to say
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
menstruating person in the bill and then
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
tell the department for the purposes of
 
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
estimating the impact assume you know
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
all these students from this age you
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
know to get the ballpark impact I don't
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
know yeah I'd have to look at the bill I
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was a reimbursement so
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
that the local education agencies would
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
apply for reimbursement so maybe they
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
would say who their eligible students
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
are I don't know I think it was a
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
straight up payment based on the number
 
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:14.810 align:start position:0%
straight up payment based on the number
of

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
because uh we're getting into the world
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.230 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily appropriate language but
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
a girl who identifies as a boy will
 
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
menstruate but that individual
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
identifies as a boy so yeah you would
 
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.829 align:start position:0%
identifies as a boy so yeah you would
have

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
in that world it's a way to avoid all
 
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.970 align:start position:0%
in that world it's a way to avoid all
that

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
that was I I'll talk to you offline
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
about that because that's kind of
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's part Legend there but there's
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
also a very sad story because of the
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
school shootings that led to that but
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to talk to you about that
 
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.510 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to talk to you about that
later

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
so the the bill does refer to a funding
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
request form that the department would
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
develop so I think the the districts
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
would complete that and provide it where
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
it does say the Department of Education
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
shall fund the local acquisition of
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
products at a rate of X dollars we
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
talked about three instead of 15 is
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill and then it says for
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
every enrolled female having passed her
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
12th birthday if we don't Define 12th
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
birthday I don't know
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
I think your language is right either
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
you're menstruating or you're not
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter your age and there are
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
girls who are menstruating at 10 now
 
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.329 align:start position:0%
girls who are menstruating at 10 now
sadly

00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
sadly
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
and there are girls who menstruate later
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
and there is no I mean it's it's
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
reasonably straightforward for a school
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
to estimate how many of their students
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
will need this they know their students
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
better I don't think I you know want to
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
set this age or that age and again the
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
ages change you know
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know when the uh the principle was
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
and uh testified
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
he said that everything went fine until
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
this was mandated and the way that I
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
took what he had to say was that if you
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
eliminated the Mandate this entire
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
discussion is moved yep
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
so why not eliminate the Mandate the guy
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
running the show that's what he he wants
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
to do the the principal and I think the
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
other one was superintendent a
 
00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
superintendent they both agreed
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
why are we going through all this just
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the Mandate because some
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
schools did not make it available
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
apparently that's their decision I was
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
on vacation that local control sorry
 
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.650 align:start position:0%
on vacation that local control sorry
yeah

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
but I apparently there was a identified
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
need for the legislation so
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
rather than try to go back and revisit
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
the reasons
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
so I can draft something just based on
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion we've had and then we can
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
discuss that at a future work session
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
that'd be great thank you
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
does anybody else identify anything on
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
this list
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
just one quick thing the
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
um form that Mickey is talking about is
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the part of the bill that refers to
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
retroactive payments so obviously we'd
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
have to move that language into the
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate paragraph to preserve it
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
once we eliminate the retroactive part
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
sits in section 6 Roman numeral six and
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
I think we would we can move it to
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
section for the you know form
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
yeah the the Retro I think is section
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
two of the bill starting on line 19.
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
I stand corrected so I think if you're a
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
structure section two we probably take
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
so again we'd heard for instance the doe
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
contract to recodify their laws we had
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
heard from uh director aliconis from OLS
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
about that as well as I think
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Greg Hill I have not
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
heard any follow-up from anyone on this
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
as far as an amendment uh so perhaps
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
when we get the Department in we can see
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
where anything is with that I don't have
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
anything on that
 
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.230 align:start position:0%
anything on that
um

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
the math learning communities program we
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
heard from ccsnh on that
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
um that's not in the governor's
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
recommended budget but you do have that
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
bill retained dual and concurrent
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
enrollment we had a separate bill that
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
is in here
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
1.25 million represents the difference
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
of what the governor funded versus what
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
that bill would have funded so that bill
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
was 3.25 million a year the governor did
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
2 million a year so that would be the
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
difference depending on how how much you
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to fund
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
two million years already in the
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
governor's budget yeah so if you if you
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
kept that alone it's at 2 million a year
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
now and then I think the courses go from
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
two to three or something like that it
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of courses
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh doe we had a house bill 542 relative
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
to a new data analyst position
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
that is not included in the governor's
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
recommended budget that position so that
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
would be incremental to the accounts
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
that you see in here
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh household 560 the contact
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
notification program administered by the
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
division of State Police we briefly
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
touched on that with the Department of
 
00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
Safety last week that's only fifty
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for them to to do that
 
00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:45.230 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for them to to do that
work

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then the extraordinary needs
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
accountability plan depending on what we
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
do with Ed funding we'll make sure that
 
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:54.380 align:start position:0%
there's no unintended consequences there
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
if you move forward with the
 
00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
um as part of the plan then it's up if
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
you want to decide whether to change the
 
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
threshold for when an accountability
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
plan is required
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
but that's there's the same statute is
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
impacted in House Bill too so we'll
 
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:14.099 align:start position:0%
effectively get to House Bill 638 as
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
part of our house bill to work quick
 
00:41:15.839 --> 00:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
part of our house bill to work quick
question

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
that accountability plan is there any
 
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:22.220 align:start position:0%
place in legislation where it is defined
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
what exactly is an accountability plan
 
00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:26.569 align:start position:0%
what exactly is an accountability plan
because

00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand we've discussed
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
it as being a significant burden so you
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
know you you shouldn't require one for
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
schools to get fifty thousand or less
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
but if an accountability plan for a two
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar thing is something
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
scribbled on the back of a napkin and a
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
sign you know it would be a lesser
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
burden so I'm trying to see what the
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
complexity of the accountability plan is
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
and if there is a specific legal
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
definition or we're just assuming it
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
I think there is so if you open if you
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
have your house bill too yep uh on page
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
64 of your house bill too it's language
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's included in here but not edited
 
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
it kind of gives you some of the
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
criteria required for the uh
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
upon a quick review of that paragraph
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
it just specifies you know that you've
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
got to generate data and measure it and
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
report it back it doesn't say anything
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
about how complicated or simple it may
 
00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:38.990 align:start position:0%
about how complicated or simple it may
be

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't think it would be a
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
large burden unless there is a you know
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
rules making stuff where the Department
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
of Education may make that very
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
complicated just based on the statute it
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
seems that the requirement is pretty
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
basic that you know a small amount of
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
money you receive would require a small
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
amount of data to be provided because
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
you know how much time can I spend
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
talking about how I spend a thousand
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
dollars I I think these are good
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
questions and the department is planned
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
to discuss those with us because as part
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
of one of the subsequent requests that
 
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:11.780 align:start position:0%
they had was relative to Staffing to
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
administer and comply with those plans
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a discussion they'd be
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
AI sure can I just make sure I
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
understood you so
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
um just you know say line 57 the 16
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
million that's 16 million above what's
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
proposed in the
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the budget yes so there's the budget
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
of an x amount and all these are this is
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
what it costs with the additional uh
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
bills above what the government has okay
 
00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:46.940 align:start position:0%
thanks just yeah I mean as as best of my
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
accuracy you know if anything you know
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
as we progress I'll make sure we are 100
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
accurate on everything but I'm I feel
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
confident in these but I make mistakes
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
so there could be something there
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
well the only one I I really felt
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
compelled to do something about was the
 
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
28-day violation
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has a
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
thoughts on any of the others
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
Mary my only thought is I have lots of
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts but
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
um with regard to hb2 we don't have to
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
take everything that the governor put
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
into the budget and we can as we take
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
things out we can use those dollars for
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
a different purpose
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
so we have to take something out
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
somewhere yes I I just don't have the
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
dollars speaking can I I just address
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
that now I know that Ways and Means
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
brought us in I think was 130 million or
 
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.849 align:start position:0%
brought us in I think was 130 million or
150.

00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
150.
 
00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:42.170 align:start position:0%
150.
yeah

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
um but I'm sure
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
if you define that 150 is that what
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to be short yeah
 
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
the 130 million dollars
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
their revenue estimate is lower than
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
what the governor's Revenue estimate was
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can give you any context but
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
there are also dollars that are Surplus
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
dollars there are other dollars that may
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
be available
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
how would we know that we have the
 
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:13.940 align:start position:0%
authority to use those
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
that question is probably a full
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
committee type of question
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
um as far as establishing full committee
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
um you know in the past when we've had
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
big cuts to do usually they'll split up
 
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
and give targets to each division and go
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
figure that out in this case uh even
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
with the revenue estimates being lower
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
there is like we've mentioned a lot of
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
surplus funds to close out 23 the rainy
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
day fund balance is is Big there's a big
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
unexpended education trust fund it's
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
really up to
 
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'd say the committee as a whole to
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
parse out how much money per division to
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
be able to do its its work
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
but we have 170 million dollars to work
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
with within the education Trust
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that it's not quite 170
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
anymore with it with the revenue because
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
that that number of Revenue is a lot of
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
that was education trust fund okay thank
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
you so but I have a a snapshot we can
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
walk through here shortly well let's
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
walk let's keep going
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
well real quick so all the bills we have
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow I've got some costs on
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
there so there's one that changes the uh
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
Grant amount for the charter schools
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's increased about five million
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
dollars a year uh the bills relative to
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
the EFA program so we have a bill that
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
changes eligibility we've got another
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
bill relative to the Department of
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
Education administering that program
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
rather than the scholarship organization
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything from the
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
um we have another bill relative to the
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education being required
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
to provide their statutes and rules to
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
certain legislative committees with the
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
way that that was amended there's no
 
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
cost to that so you probably could if
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
you support that pass it there's no
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact any longer to that bill uh
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
521 representative you had mentioned
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that you're on so we'll
 
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
hear about that from the Department
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow relative to episode of
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
treatment or no yes and uh the yeah the
 
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
treatment or no yes and uh the yeah the
um

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
quarter Replacements and then we do had
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
two we did have two education funding
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
related bills uh representative fellows
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
Bill relative to fiscal capacity
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and additional Aid based
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
on free and reduced lunch as well as I
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
think representative Ladd relative to
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
enhanced special education as part of
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
the education funding formula so both of
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
those as you can see the price tag on
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
there those are rough estimates as
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
incremental total cost from what the
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
governor's plan was so that would be
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the funding levels of
 
00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about the direct Medicaid
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
certification we'll talk more with that
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
with the Department tomorrow
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
there's the division of early learning
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:54.349 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
um that's my bill
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
um in my intent and I've spoken with
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
many people my intent on that bill is to
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
retain it and just retain it okay
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
and not to put it in the budget
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're not ready
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that rounds out the bills for
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and like I said there are three
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
on the house floor Thursday that if
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
passed probably should come to us so we
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
may get three more after this Thursday
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
they're all on the calendar without
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations so it'll depend on how
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
things go Thursday
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
the last two items on here uh in the
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Education had talked about
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
the in the um change to the snap
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
eligibility may impact the free and
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch population which was not
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
captured in the governor's funding
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
those grants will be paid out it's just
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
not accounted for essentially so their
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to carry some dollars
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement reflecting that
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy is probably going to be a
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
little bit more than we think because of
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
that new population that's going to be
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's already been approved by fiscal
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
that that's uh it's going to happen it's
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
just they don't have the data to make
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
the estimate but so that these are just
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
rough estimates as like a placeholder
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we heard from the
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
that they felt that the governors uh
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
recommended budget surplus statement the
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
lapse estimates may have been a little
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
too high so
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
um they had provided what they feel
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
could be an adjustment to those to
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the lapse estimate would
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
essentially cost you 20 million over the
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
so that's that's essentially the entire
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
universe if you will of House Bill 2
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill one agency requests and all
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
your bills those last four pages
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
the next uh page I'll I'll just just to
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mary's point
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:52.010 align:start position:0%
would it be
better

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
than we're trying to take action on
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
these is to retain them
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
I would say the ones that if if they are
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
ones you want to discuss as far as
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
budget affordability or including in the
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
budget certainly I'd say house bill 364.
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
House Bill 492 our
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
um our bills that don't carry a price
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
tag right and they pass policy and pass
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
the house already so now that we have
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know fiscal analysis on those you
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
probably could move those along if
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're okay with them and not have to
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
include them in the budget or retain
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
them you can just pass them separately
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
that raises a question if the money if
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
the money's taken out of them why are we
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
touching them
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
so bills are tagged for fiscal uh or for
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
finance committee early on and sometimes
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
they're amended and so in the case of
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
the second one the first one probably
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been referred to us in
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
the first place but the second one uh it
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
was amended in such a way that it took
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact away but on the house
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
floor it's referred to finance by the
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
time we do the fiscal analysis the
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
Bill's already here so so but those two
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
I I don't you wouldn't have to carry
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
anything in your budget plan relative to
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
those two bills
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
researcher because
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
what's the you know quickest way in
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
which we could uh you know act on those
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
bills because again I'm not sure what
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
the process is when can we you know
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
because again it's a policy bill with no
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
physical impact I don't think we should
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
really even
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
well we can we can vote a recommendation
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
anytime all right right so if we wanted
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
to recommend the two hat that don't have
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
any uh dollars in today
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
we can do that we technically today we
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
have a budget work session scheduled
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we have a work session on those
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
okay so tomorrow you could vote ought to
 
00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:41.540 align:start position:0%
pass if you wanted to move those along
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
and then retain the others or uh
 
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do with them
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
I have 620 and 601 and 601 I hope that
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
actually we could just stick that in hb2
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we can or not but it
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
would be nice if we could you certainly
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
can that one uh the department is asking
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
for a new position so if that was
 
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
something you were going to support
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from the Department tomorrow
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then it's up to you if you want to
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
support the bill and then also support
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
their request for a new position and
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's something we can talk through
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
with them tomorrow well anything we vote
 
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
with them tomorrow well anything we vote
for

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
on this list we've got to take something
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
else out over there so
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
well and I have if I may I have some
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
requests from um uh chair lad
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh the overall education
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
budget and he was hoping to see an
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
increase in building Aid we've got 43
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
in each year of the biennium and he was
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
hoping that that would be increased can
 
00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:51.020 align:start position:0%
you give a page number
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
actually I'm in the department of Ed
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
budget right now the one that gave us
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
it was that the
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner told us you know the
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
handy dandy that tells you all
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
everything it is Page 1205 if you wanted
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
to look in the big document
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
um and then tuition and transportation
 
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's 9 million and it's been 9 million
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
for as long as I can remember and the
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
actual cost is in excess of 11 million
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
for each year it would be a big Aid to
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
school districts if we could increase
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
that amount and CTE is a program that we
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
really have been trying to get more kids
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
into so a
 
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
cheerlead would like to see an increase
 
00:53:33.609 --> 00:53:33.619 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
and it's not 364.
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 364 doesn't change how
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
much money goes out it changes how the
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is calculated per per
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
District uh that plan that program is
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
bound by how much you put in the budget
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
so that that bill changes how the amount
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
is derived but it still stays within
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars so there's no
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact for that reason because
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you appropriate in the budget
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
is really what drives total State
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
spending for that program because it's a
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's not quite a proration but it the
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rate is calculated
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
based on the state appropriation this
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
just changes a little bit of the policy
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
but behind the scenes if you will and
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
the uh for me and the other area I was
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
hoping to increase by 400 000 is adult
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
education when we ask the commissioner
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
um about that line
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
um he added that he would like to see
 
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
that 400 000 in addition to the amount
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
um that was originally requested
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
and the adult in people would like that
 
00:54:43.319 --> 00:54:44.809 align:start position:0%
and the adult in people would like that
too

00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
Mary can you get more of that detail to
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
us so I can stick it in the budget here
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
I couldn't follow I couldn't find
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
everything you were talking about
 
00:54:57.059 --> 00:54:58.190 align:start position:0%
everything you were talking about
it's

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
so you've got some baby programs right
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
you got some more documents yes so
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
um so along the lines of Representative
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
Heath's uh topic she just brought up if
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
there are anything if there is anything
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
outside of what we've gone through here
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
that any of the members would like an
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
amendment for I'd like to add some money
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
to this or remove money for that you can
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
work with me I can add something to this
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
as a member Amendment if you will and
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
then have a document that makes it clear
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
what you're looking to do that can be
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee and you can
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
make motions that way and make changes
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
so the next page is a landscape oriented
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
this one it's just another uh summary
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
page of the decisions that you make in
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
house bill one and House Bill 2 that
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
have dollar impacts so at this point
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
we've really only done the law
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement accreditation program for
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
police standards and then a couple
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
Corrections and I'll carry every change
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
we make on here just so you can see your
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
net total by source of funds as we go
 
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.170 align:start position:0%
net total by source of funds as we go
along

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
and then the next three this is in this
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
is in uh
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is actually 150 000. this is real
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
dollars So yeah so when you're looking
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
at that it's 150 000 yeah this isn't
 
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:18.260 align:start position:0%
right no this one's not right
 
00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.049 align:start position:0%
right no this one's not right
no

00:56:20.049 --> 00:56:20.059 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
see in in Department of Safety actually
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
saved us three thousand and seven
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars with one of their requests so
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
every little bit helps you made some
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
so the the last three pages in this
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
packet are snapshots or Surplus
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
statements whatever you want to call
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
them for the education trust fund the
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund and then the fish and game
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
fund uh I have Incorporated house Ways
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
and Means revenues into these so if you
 
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.549 align:start position:0%
and Means revenues into these so if you
recall

00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
uh it's still in the binder clip
 
00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:56.270 align:start position:0%
uh it's still in the binder clip
document

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so the education trust fund at the
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
top yep so uh you will see if you
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
remember this document I provided last
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
week or week week before and from the
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
bottom right the ending balance at the
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
end of fiscal 25 was like 148 million
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
dollars incorporating the house Ways and
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
Means revenues now that balance is 63
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
million so so that a lot of the uh the
 
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
variance between the governor's Revenue
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
estimates and house Ways and Means fell
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund the rest
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
being General funds now did this
 
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.890 align:start position:0%
being General funds now did this
oh

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
you see this is what our our ways and
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
means numbers yes this is essentially
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
where you're at now with your house ways
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
it means committee Revenue estimates so
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh reconfiguration of
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
property business profits taxes that's
 
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
still included in here so if you look at
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
lines 14 15 and 16 since that's in House
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 before you I'm including that
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
adjustment in here if you take those
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
sections out I would take those rows out
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
and you can see those net to about 73
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
million and 24 and then 74 million and
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
25 as a
 
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue decrease of the education trust
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
fund and then the general fund Surplus
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
statement would have an offsetting
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
increase of Revenue got it okay
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
so this is uh I won't go into Super
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
detail with all this
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
I'll just jump down to line 32. here is
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
where you'll start to see
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
some new programs that were not
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
historically part of the education trust
 
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
fund so court ordered placements State
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
Testing building lease aid for Charter
 
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
Testing building lease aid for Charter
Schools

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:39.859 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
education trust fund Administration I
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
think it's like a student data system is
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
most of that there's an accounting unit
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the budget and then the Career and
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
Technical education renovation money
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
which is normally uh
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
a capital budget so you'll see those
 
00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.030 align:start position:0%
a capital budget so you'll see those
essentially

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
you don't see it in 23 because those
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
historically had historically been
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
covered through other funding sources
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
mainly General funds and the capital
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
budget for the CTE
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
so as you make changes in
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
this is where discussing with the other
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
divisions and the committee chair is is
 
00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:14.390 align:start position:0%
divisions and the committee chair is is
important

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
63 million looks like oh we've got 63
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
million to spend it may may not be
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
they may not be looking at it the whole
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee may not be looking that that's
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
all division choose money to spend they
 
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
may be looking for some more offset of
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
General funds for instance so I would
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
just make sure that there's
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
communication across the other divisions
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
as far as how much is really available
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.569 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question about the um
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
inclusion of um the technical
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
Center renovation
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
historically that's something that we've
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
never ever put in houseville one or two
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we're setting a bad
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
precedent and
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
now do we know if if they in fact have
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
even passed a bond to be able to do this
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
or um
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I just don't know enough about this
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm very uncomfortable doing this to be
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
honest and I think this is something we
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
could you know because again we're going
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
to have to have the Department of
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
Education in a talk House Bill too and
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
there's House Bill 2 changes in here
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
moving this program from the capital
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
budget to the operating budget so
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
talking about if the locals have
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
approved this project for instance or if
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
there's any other projects or that we'd
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
have to drill down with the agency on
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
that which we haven't done yet that we
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
didn't get into that when they were in
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
last week or the week yeah last week
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
because in all honesty I would prefer
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
we have many many projects on that
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
building Aid list and if we're going to
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
take 12 million this is 12 million
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
dollars out of the education trust I
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
would rather see it go to building aid
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
for our schools than
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
this is a capital budget item I think
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
and I I just think we're setting a bad
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
precedent if we do this now I think in
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
the future whenever the education trust
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
fund has excess funding everybody's
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
going to dump whatever it is that they
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
possibly can into the trust
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's my feelings and I hate to sound
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
like a broken record I'm so I like to
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
make this quick point this is where
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
communication with your policy
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
committees will be important uh to know
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
if there's room in the capital budget
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
for instance for this so if the idea is
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
to move this from House Bill one and two
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 25 Public Works and
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
highways would have to be part of that
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
conversation we couldn't just make that
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
decision to change House Bill 25 over
 
01:01:43.079 --> 01:01:45.289 align:start position:0%
decision to change House Bill 25 over
here

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh trying to
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
understand you know this particular
 
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.750 align:start position:0%
understand you know this particular
project

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education what
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
exactly is being renovated is it a uh
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know ccsnh facility or our various
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
City facilities in schools I don't
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
recall the exact details of that
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
particular project because it would
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
change the way it would have to be
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
bonded and decided right
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I'm not an expert on this I
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
know it's relative to one location the
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
Sugar River Valley Regional tech center
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
in Newport and under those circumstances
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
I would say that most likely we cannot
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
ask the community to you know Bond or
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
pay that's a state facility owned by a
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
state school and we would no I'm wrong
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay that's why I'm asking because I
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
don't know I would appreciate any
 
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.710 align:start position:0%
don't know I would appreciate any
background

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mary you might know her Mickey you
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
would know this um Capital has its
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
procedures uh to go through in order to
 
01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
do a project
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
would this potentially do an end run
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
around those procedures or were those
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
procedures automatically apply here I
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
mean this is a totally different this is
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
a very new program it's new to do this
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
and are we pulling the rug out from
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
under how Capital would have done this
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
and the guard rails that they have in
 
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.849 align:start position:0%
and the guard rails that they have in
place

01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
and that's a great point to perhaps
 
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
coordinate with your policy committee on
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
it I can tell you the house bill 2
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
language does strike references to the
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
capital process from that yeah yes so I
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
think the idea is to change this from a
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
capital perspective to a cash operating
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
budget program
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
because usually when the CTE centers are
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
doing any kind of a capital work they
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
have a list and they have a date by
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
which their project is going to come up
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
and so they go to the capital budget
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
they've already worked with their
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
Community because they've got they're
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
supposed to have gotten approval from
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
the local community so that's how it
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
usually works there's a queue that's put
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
in place for CTE centers so I don't know
 
01:03:45.839 --> 01:03:46.970 align:start position:0%
in place for CTE centers so I don't know
how

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know how this got here
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
I don't either yeah and and uh and I
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't either so that's something we
 
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
would we would discuss with the
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
Department on the process how why the
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
governor proposed this method versus the
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
we got a bunch of outdoor notes Here
 
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:11.940 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
so that school building Aid
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
sounds like the same kind of thing to me
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's a capital
 
01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:22.849 align:start position:0%
that's a capital
investment

01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
that one has always been an operating
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
budget item yeah okay I mean back it
 
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.170 align:start position:0%
budget item yeah okay I mean back it
back

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:29.180 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
pre-2010 we used to pay
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the debt service along with
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
the municipalities through the duration
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
of their bonding on the project since
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
the law changed in 2013 this is when
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
we're front loading our Aid so we give
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
them 80 percent the first year and then
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
20 of the year it's completed right and
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
then we're done with that project so
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's more of a current cost
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
now for the state than a long long term
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
and you will see I broke out on here on
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
lines 25 and 26 the tail payments
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
which is the payments that we're making
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the previously approved projects and
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
then you can see the governor did
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
include 22.6 million and then 26.1
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
million for new school building Aid in
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
this biennium
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
and then the 75 million dollars down
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
below his intention is to have that be
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
earmarked essentially for next biennium
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
but all of that is subject to to what
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
you folks want to do on this committee
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
but with the amounts and the timing and
 
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
but with the amounts and the timing and
everything

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
so the where's the current 50 million
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
so the 50 is essentially the line 25
 
01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
plus 26 plus The Debt Service on the
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
bonding that we have in the treasury's
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
budget that's not in the education trust
 
01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
fund that's a uh okay yeah so that's how
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's the education trust fund snapshot
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
as we are today so essentially your
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
starting point with your budget starting
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
point where that was Bill 2 but with
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
your house Ways and Means revenues
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
so similarly on the next page uh the
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
highway fund is built so you can see
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
um and I did this I will say rather
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
quickly today just to kind of see where
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
um working off the governor's document
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
changing it for the house Ways and Means
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
revenues which was a couple million
 
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
dollars more actually in uh fiscal 23
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
than what the governor had however since
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget came out the
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
department did come to fiscal committee
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
for some winter maintenance money from
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
Surplus so that netted out some of that
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
so uh long story short
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
you've got about 13.2 million and we
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
usually do the highway fund and Fish and
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
Game fund on a gap basis and so you'll
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
see that that assumes their end-of-year
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
Gap adjustment to make sure it still
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
balances on a cruel basis
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
we have received a few requests from
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
safety and D.O.T uh relative to Highway
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
fund uses uh
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have to pay for with Highway
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
funds for instance if you have General
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
funds available we can work out swaps of
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
funding or transfer from the general to
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
Highway fund which has been done for
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
many budgets in a row now whatever you
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
decide to do as far as the prioritized
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
needs from the Departments of
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
transportation and safety
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
we can figure out how you want to do
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
do we have any visibility and I know
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's purely guesswork and speculation
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
when would uh we start wouldn't win with
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
the legislature address the you know
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
funding imbalance in the current Highway
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
fund because pretty much right now we
 
01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
are looking to spend it down in the next
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
biennium and have a spare change left in
 
01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:47.930 align:start position:0%
biennium and have a spare change left in
it

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
and obviously as a long-term policy this
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
is not uh
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
tenable but if there is incoming reform
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
that would start addressing this I would
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
feel a bit more comfortable spending it
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
down to that level if I don't have the
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
confidence that that is happening you
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
know I would be much more cautious about
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
spending this because we're basically
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
gonna you know we are projecting running
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
or essentially out
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
the reserves well two terms ago there
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
was a bill
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
that Norm put forward
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
that changed registration fees
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
and what it did was it took cars that
 
01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.209 align:start position:0%
and what it did was it took cars that
didn't

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
use gasoline
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
and that they had the highest additional
 
01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.030 align:start position:0%
and that they had the highest additional
fee

01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
then he had a had it by miles per gallon
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
rating from the manufacturer
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
that High I mean cars to get 40 miles a
 
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
gallon they pay a little more or but
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
less than the no gas but a little a
 
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
little bit more than everybody else
 
01:08:58.610 --> 01:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
and it marched down the gas mileage
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
until you got down up to like 15 miles a
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
gallon you paid the same things you're
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
paying now
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
because you're using a lot of gas so uh
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
it was a very spirited debate as I
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
recall and the issue became that you're
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
punishing people that buy electric cars
 
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what it came down to
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
and that I mean that wasn't the intent
 
01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:23.900 align:start position:0%
the intent was to get
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
road tolls
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
from everybody more equally that that
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
was free huh use your fee would you use
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
it more you pay them right well that was
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
but I I think in in rsas they're called
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
Road toks uh instead of gas tax but I
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
think that was a good idea then I think
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea now but we don't have
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
it built actively on it but we do have
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
to do something because this this is
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
going to go to zero
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
and he said it
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah there was also the proposal
 
01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.669 align:start position:0%
yeah there was also the proposal
um

01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
of when you register your car you
 
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
register the amount of miles that you've
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
driven during that year so the more
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
miles you drive the more Road usage
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
you've used up and so having some kind
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
of a scale reflecting of how much you
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually use the road as opposed to how
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
much gas you use or you don't use and I
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
don't think we've ever come to a point
 
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
where we all agree which direction and
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
which to go yeah I think that I think
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
the argument on that one
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh had to do with people drive out of
 
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.610 align:start position:0%
uh had to do with people drive out of
state

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
you know thirty percent of the workforce
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
goes into Massachusetts and don't use
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
our roads at all so you know there was
 
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.570 align:start position:0%
our roads at all so you know there was
everything

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.729 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
so just so you'll know there has been
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
attempted uh
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
you know and and the other one is is
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
just straight let's raise the road toll
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
and then and and most of one party says
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no no taxes so I mean
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to raise the toll for out of
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
but you know what
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
can we do that in hb2
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
50 cents
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
the tolls
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
oh tolls I thought I'm talking about the
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
gas tax oh can't do that no it's called
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
but it's called road toll in in statute
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
technically you can do it all it's all
 
01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
stat story so what we heard from the
 
01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation under
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
current law the executive Council
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
approves the Turnpike tolls which is not
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here with the
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
highway fund that's the turnpike fund
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
which we haven't heard anything about
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
that the road toll and motor vehicle
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
fees that's all set in statute and that
 
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
fees that's all set in statute and that
is

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
subject to any Amendment or any bill
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's just that I think we all agree at
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
least in this room that right now there
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
is a significant imbalance between you
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
know various fees paid by various
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
drivers who use roads equally and I
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
thought the original goal of having a
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
gas tax assuming everybody buys gas is
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
to make it reasonably fair for everybody
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
to pay their equal share and even then
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
you could argue some people buy gas in
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to drive to mass but it
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
evens out with people who drive by gas
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
in Mass to drive to New Hampshire or
 
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
in Mass to drive to New Hampshire or
whatnot

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
but this is clearly going into a very
 
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
different direction because of all the
 
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
different fuels that we use these days
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
so you know I mean honestly one way or
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
the other will have to figure this out
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
because uh right now it's unfair and
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's getting even further down the path
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
of unfairness to various people so
 
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.570 align:start position:0%
of unfairness to various people so
anyway

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're right to notice that
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
deficit each year you know the current
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
year and that's nothing new that's been
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
the highway fund story for a decade and
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
a half at least and there's usually been
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the Department one time
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
fixes to get through and uh the get
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
through this year I would say is their
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
beginning balance that they're coming
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
into this biennium with that's how this
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
is working if you look at you know
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're starting with over 147 million
 
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
you're starting with over 147 million
dollars

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
you know to begin fiscal 23
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially what's balancing
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
your budget for the next couple years
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
and as far as I I don't remember all of
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
them off top of my head I can only think
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
of I know there's a Senate bill
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
that implements a surcharge on electric
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
or hybrid vehicles like a hundred
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollars added which I think it was like
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
a million bucks a year or less than that
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
in new Revenue that's the only Bill I
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
can think of right now but there may be
 
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.110 align:start position:0%
can think of right now but there may be
others

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are with the highway
 
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.830 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are with the highway
fund

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
um any if there's no questions on that I
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
just have one more page here
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
and it's the fish and game fund and I
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
presented this one slightly different I
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
presented the governors versus where you
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
are with division two right now I did
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
change the uh revenues to be house Ways
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
and Means revenues which the only change
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
is on row six and fiscal 23 you'll see
 
01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
dollars difference there
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
that's the uh that's the only difference
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
that was made I will point out what I
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
believe to be a mistake in the
 
01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.050 align:start position:0%
believe to be a mistake in the
governor's

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement if you look at that
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
row five transfers from general fund in
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 there's one million dollars in
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 25 there's one and a half
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
there's actually not a general fund
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
transfer into the fish and game fund
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
there's general fund support in the fish
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
and game budget but it's not really a
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
general fund addition to the Fish and
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
Game fund so where we saw the governor's
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
final uh budget our final Surplus
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
balance of about seven million dollars
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
kind of on the bottom right there for
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 based on making that
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
correction I think the fish and game
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
funds somewhere around 4.6 million of an
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
ending balance right now based on the
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
budget before you
 
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.010 align:start position:0%
budget before you
clarification

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure I understand it
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
correctly the same amount of money you
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
know is supposed to be spent or you know
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
the revenue provided it's just that you
 
01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
are saying that the governor's budget
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
seems to incorrectly state that this is
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
going into the fund when in reality it's
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
just operational funds that are provided
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
and used so nothing will come in here
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay but they only made the error on
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
this side
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
so basically the fact that we end up
 
01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:14.209 align:start position:0%
so basically the fact that we end up
with

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
2.5 million less in this fund does it
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
also indicate that we have 2.5 millions
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
of lapsing funds in the general budget
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
or was it just a one-sided error just
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
one-sided the general fund Surplus
 
01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
statement captured that two and a half
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars already got captured the
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
second time she had to by mistake
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
correct that's what I needed to
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
ask about fishing game so fishing game
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
they wanted two more um
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
people that go out to do search and
 
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.890 align:start position:0%
people that go out to do search and
rescue

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
rescue
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
and that would be from the general fund
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I did get clarification on that this
 
01:15:59.810 --> 01:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
budget includes all the positions funded
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
what their request is is to change the
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
funding of two positions from Fish and
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
Game to General funds
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so essentially to alleviate the use of
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game funds and have more
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
general fund support for their
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement but they've got the
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
positions authorized and funded already
 
01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
in here they just want to change the
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
source of funds for those two positions
 
01:16:20.699 --> 01:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
source of funds for those two positions
so

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
that's a switch from what we normally do
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
usually they support themselves
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
there has been that's where the general
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
fund infusion is so the one in one and a
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
half million of General funds is in
 
01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:36.780 align:start position:0%
their enforcement unit
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
so this would be building upon previous
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
policies just to a more to have more
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
positions general fund than current and
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
then they want one other person that's a
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
secretarial in nature and that one would
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
be true correct and then we also had
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
heard that one of their arpa programs
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
that supports a couple of positions only
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
runs the first 18 months of the year and
 
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
it the numbers I got from them today
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's about 190 000 I think they told us
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
like 140. it's about 190 000 of general
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
fund support they would ask that they
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
could complete those positions for the
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
for the biennium and all of those are
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
presented on on this document here so we
 
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
would we want to probably do that or do
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
you think they have enough Surplus
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can answer that
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
question I think I think they would say
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
you could look at their balance and say
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
it could absorb it and then you look at
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
their operating certain deficit each
 
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
year and it would some would say you're
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
just taking away from the fund balance
 
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
to start the next biennium so it's
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
really a decision of the committee left
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
did you ever hear back from Charlie I
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
did that's a great segue
 
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
so I have
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
is this relative to wait where's Charlie
 
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre the one point yes three
 
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.310 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre the one point yes three
million

01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:04.370 align:start position:0%
million
Lottery

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
so Lottery had talked about adding uh
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
1.2 million approximately to fiscal 24.
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
to do a some software acquisition that
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
they wanted to implement so they gave us
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a write up here I can
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
tell you that division one did approve
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
the doit end of this transaction and you
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
can see in the memo here Lottery
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
Commission is not expecting this will
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
not change their revenue estimate they
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
had this part of their 158 million
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
dollar Revenue estimate in fiscal 24. so
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
this would be in the budget as other
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
funds Lottery funds but it wouldn't
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
impact your education trust fund
 
01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:03.050 align:start position:0%
impact your education trust fund
situation

01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
so yep
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to move that um we um accept
 
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
and approve the proposal submitted To Us
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
by um the lottery
 
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
second and also their budget
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
yeah you could you could finalize their
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
budget close them out tentatively
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
everything's tentative of course and
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have any House Bill 2
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'll second
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
you did okay I already did you're my
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
they submitted
 
01:19:50.169 --> 01:19:50.179 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're just authorizing them to
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
spend that money well and appropriating
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
and approve their budget right yeah as
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
submitted estimated everything they
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
spent had to be appropriate
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
no they're an Enterprise fund that's
 
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
no they're an Enterprise fund that's
right

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
well so the motion is to appropriate
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
that amount you know for the lottery we
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to appropriate to approve
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're an Enterprise fund they fund
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
themselves they have their own money
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
technically speaking will increase their
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
class 27 in fiscal 24 in their budget
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
here by this amount and that that'll be
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
the change that you see in the budget
 
01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
the change that you see in the budget
document

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
and class 27 is transfers to the
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
on this document here that was item
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
number 47 so when I do republish this
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
for another time I'll have some shade on
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
there so you'll see some progress on on
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
what else you got for us today mate
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't really have anything for you
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's not General Highway or education
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund and I'm not sure if if you're
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
feeling like you want to do much at this
 
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
point with that uh I the fishing game
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
position you probably could do that one
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the accounting Tech position
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fish and game fund position
 
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's one that the department had
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
requested and you know they're the
 
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
keepers of their funds so they must feel
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a prudent use of of dollars
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
so if you look on this uh busy schedule
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
here it's line number
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh 32
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
so this would be creating a new position
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's one that they had testified that I
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
think Mr chair was the day you weren't
 
01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
here for fishing game so this was a
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
position they had testified that they
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
had had and then when admin Services did
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
the shared services program they lost
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
that position and then shared services
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
was somewhat wound back and they never
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
got the position back so they're looking
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
for for this uh essentially one that
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
and and the motion is for the um
 
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game new accounting technician
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
positions the amounts specified in line
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
32 of this summary which I'll write them
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
down and it's again to
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate or approve it approve it
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
approve the position yeah they already
 
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.229 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
they're in house bill one but funded
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
with Fish and Game funds and they they
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
would like you to reduce the fish and
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
game funds and replace it with General
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
funds and that's that Offset you see on
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
lines 33 and 34.
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
so that would essentially be a 350 000
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
general fund cost to do that
 
01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:17.930 align:start position:0%
general fund cost to do that
change

01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
hold off on that one
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
and fish and game's other item uh just
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
above on lines 29 and 30. so this is you
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
can see all the federal funds
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
on lines 20 online 29 but that only runs
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
the first 18 months of the biennium and
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
then the 193 would carry out January
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
through June of fiscal 25 so uh
 
01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
if you were to support
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
that general fund continuation of those
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
positions we could budget the federal
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
funds to that way that account would be
 
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
built for them for the two years but I
 
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
had a question I don't remember
 
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.330 align:start position:0%
had a question I don't remember
um

01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
if we fill in that six month Gap or
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
whatever you know the Gap is what
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
happens in the next year after that do
 
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
these positions go away because this is
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
arpa money isn't it
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
so where do those two positions go so
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
the arpa money goes away December so
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
what happens to these two positions
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
you're authorizing them and continuing
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
them with General funds so they would
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
say until the end of the biennium just
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
like any other position in the Bible so
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
there presumably they'll come back in
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
the next biennium for the full amount
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
for these two positions if they were to
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
continue those positions for the uses
 
01:24:24.179 --> 01:24:28.450 align:start position:0%
continue those positions for the uses
yes

01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
now with that exchange I'm understanding
 
01:24:35.689 --> 01:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.699 --> 01:24:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'd rather wait and see what we got to
 
01:24:39.719 --> 01:24:40.430 align:start position:0%
I'd rather wait and see what we got to
do

01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not in the mood to spend money right
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
now because I think we've got to cut
 
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.850 align:start position:0%
now because I think we've got to cut
somewhere

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
they always have funds fishing game is
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
pretty healthy
 
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
yeah but they want General funds to pay
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
for these positions wait
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
they had testified that they didn't feel
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
like what the work of these positions is
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
representative of what the hunters and
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
fishermen are paying licenses for so
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's why they were seeking General
 
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
funds versus using their license Revenue
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
to support those positions
 
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's up to so do we know what this
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
program's about
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
they they're told I don't want to
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
misspeak yeah but they said yeah the way
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
the way I understood it like like uh the
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
moss in the aquarium they have to uh go
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
in and force
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
enforce some of these things to make
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
sure that uh and they deal with
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
agriculture I believe it was and they in
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
other words they look in to see if well
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
there might be zebra muscle uh it's
 
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
environmental yeah and so they you know
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's not really a fish and game I mean
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with other areas and
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's what happens things get dumped
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
off the fishing game which really an
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
official game
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I've had looking at
 
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
the fishing games just over the past
 
01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
several years is that they had a really
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
healthy fun their expenditures are
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
pretty much flat and their revenues are
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
pretty much flat and they keep dipping
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
into about you know the tuna four or
 
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
five million dollars every year to
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
balance themselves out and it's like
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
three years in a row that they've had to
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
pull out five million dollars so on the
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
one hand I I feel torn because you know
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
on the one hand Fish and Game by and
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
large is healthy and they still have a
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
surplus but clearly that Surplus is
 
01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:20.629 align:start position:0%
surplus but clearly that Surplus is
being

01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
um drawn down because they don't meet
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
all their expenditures so there's a part
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
of me that says we haven't given Fish
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
and Game anything and
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
several terms maybe it's time to do
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
something for them even though they
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
still have a surplus but they've drawn
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
they've gone from 13 million surplus
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
down to I think five or three so I'm I'm
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
really torn one way or the other
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
well right I think uh what was it a
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
couple terms ago that we supplemented
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
with uh what's about 675
 
01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.750 align:start position:0%
with uh what's about 675
000.

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
000.
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is this is four or five budgets in
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
a row that we've had some sort of
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
general fund support for the fish and
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
game fund yeah but I remember you know
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
it was it was a few hundred thousand
 
01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
dollars now they're two and a half
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium of general
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
fund support
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
just when he spoke about the search and
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
rescue though I was flabbergasted at the
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
extent to which the number of rescues
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
are going on and the work that they're
 
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.430 align:start position:0%
are going on and the work that they're
doing

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.090 align:start position:0%
doing
um

01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
I brought up the question about
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
techman's Ravine that they had to go up
 
01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
and help somebody up there and then he
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
proceeded to tell us about the numerous
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
um the two people they had to go up and
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
take chip out of the ice the two people
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
who died
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
um so you know I don't know if if we do
 
01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
need to support them a little bit I I
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
struggled after their presentation I
 
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
kind of was blown away by the extent of
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
their work that I just never thought
 
01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
just a quick remark to follow up on this
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
their funds should pay for what it's
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
statutory you know supposed to pay for
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
the more we expand their mission to go
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what that fund is
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay for we either have to
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
pay from the general fund or ask the
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislature to start adjusting what
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
those you know fees can be used on and
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't think I could support
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
charging Hunter for fees then go to
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
totally non-hunting purposes because
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't pay for all the other
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
stuff which leaves us to filling in the
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
money from the general fund and so I
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't really have a problem doing that
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
because we are asking them to go outside
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
of what we originally meant those funds
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
to be and if we give them the
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
responsibility we got to give them the
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
funding so
 
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
the question is I don't know that the
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislature gave me a responsibility
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
I think it's just kind of over over time
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's been an evolution of who goes on
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
rescues and things you know it's
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
did they involve themselves in this
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
process and now oh my gosh I don't have
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
enough manpower
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
well I
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
I will say with the search and rescue
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
they do have some dedicated funds for
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that they charge direct costs to
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
the search and rescue fund uh I don't I
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
think I'm circling back to this one
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
position I'm not sure if search and
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
rescue ties right back to that
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
um but didn't they start building for uh
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
they do have authority to to charge for
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
I think in negligent situations to try
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
to recover some of the costs of of the
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
rescued parties I don't think it's huge
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
dollars but they do get and they get
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
donations they also have a you can buy a
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
pass or yeah the hike safe card that
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
Revenue goes plus a portion of certain
 
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
other licenses registrations go to the
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
fishing at the search and rescue fund
 
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
too for a while it was
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
in a deficit situation but I think now
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's in positives which is good
 
01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.669 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's in positives which is good
um

01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
but yeah as far as as far as this one
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
position this is a it was arpa funds
 
01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
that that was the Genesis of of this
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
program and in those positions it's an
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
arpa money that only runs through
 
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
December of 2024 so that's where it's
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
they said they'd like to continue it
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
they don't feel it's a proper fish and
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
game fun use so that's why they're
 
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
seeking the general funds for the six
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know just looking I guess
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
the total expenditures if I get it right
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
I mean the past they got under 700 000
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
for the general fund I mean that's not a
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
lot when they're the whole budget is you
 
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
know 35 million they have a lot of other
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
funds which you know is to their credit
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think that necessarily means we
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't fund them because they have
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
other funds
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
um The Fish and Game funds are
 
01:30:41.699 --> 01:30:43.189 align:start position:0%
um The Fish and Game funds are
significant

01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
um so as I said you know I'm torn on the
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
one hand that they're self-sufficient
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand do we withhold
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
money because they're self-sufficient or
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
do we provide a little bit of funding
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
for all the other things that they do
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
for the entire State
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm you know I think this is
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
something more to talk about because I
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
do not know which way I would go right
 
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
do not know which way I would go right
now

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
I said I need to get guidance on what
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
our division's got to do I haven't got
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
that yet so I'll talk to Ken with the
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
amounts here I think you could hold and
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
then figure it out later especially you
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
know the general funds may be uh at a
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
premium for you to with all this other
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh requests you've got from the other
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
agencies so I think having a
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
a more big picture to find might be make
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
it easier for you to know if you can do
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
because right now my feet are planted
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
and the thing is they all make sense I
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
mean that's not
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
so I've got uh just to look at this the
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
schedule that you patched out and every
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
everybody got a copy of this I don't if
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
you want to give me a minute I can run
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.159 --> 01:32:27.649 align:start position:0%
 
honestly

01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to work backwards
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure there will be surprises
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I would want to just work as
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
aggressively as we can on everything
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
that we can do as early as possible and
 
01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
let us be in that fortunate situation
 
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
that we are done two days early
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I'm saying I'd I'd favor
 
01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
a very aggressive schedule as hard as we
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
can because I'm really worried as a
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
first-timer that I'm looking at the
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
to-do list and I don't know how we're
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
gonna get it done so how much runway
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
we've got to get to get this plane right
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
here I I you know I I'd be very
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
aggressive scheduling wise
 
01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.530 align:start position:0%
aggressive scheduling wise
yeah

01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's a small one but it's I will have a
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
hard time supporting the Civics textbook
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
because I trust our communities to or
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
our schools to develop their own Civics
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
so you would support the two million to
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
develop a Sex book yeah it says I would
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
have a hard time with that
 
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:28.340 align:start position:0%
specific Civics
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't see us going developing
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's not our role that's
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
quick question sure
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
Mickey if I could point you to the
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
second third page of your handout the
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
house finance division to increase its
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
decreases to consider on your first page
 
01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
of that line
 
01:34:28.739 --> 01:34:31.370 align:start position:0%
of that line
um

01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.570 align:start position:0%
 
40

01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
40
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
education school security
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
it allocates 5 million as each but then
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
it also has a node there that it says
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's convert temporary position to
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
permanent to me that looks like straight
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
up funding to the public school
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund does that just
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
happen to also include a position being
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
converted that way with a very bulk of
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
the money being for the actual fund and
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
the little amount for the position yes
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
I've got the detail behind that request
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's 4.9 million in changes got it for
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
the program and then some for the
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
position and administration just wanted
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
to clarify thank you
 
01:35:07.639 --> 01:35:12.250 align:start position:0%
to clarify thank you
foreign

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I always forget about that um that
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
commission we support
 
01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.970 align:start position:0%
commission we support
um safety

01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
um safety
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
construction or not Construction
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
safety initiatives in public non-public
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we have a list of I
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
think there were over 350
 
01:35:33.659 --> 01:35:34.370 align:start position:0%
think there were over 350
um

01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
schools that have been impacted by these
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
dollars so these are for safety for
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
schools to implement safety factors oh I
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
got I'm familiar with that I mean I've
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
been on the school board in Windham
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
we've done certain of those projects I
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
just you know the description in that
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
line was a bit unclear and I wanted to
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood it correctly and
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you it's a very Hefty process they
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
go through Amy from the Department of Ed
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.139 --> 01:36:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
so as far as the schedule goes yeah uh
 
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.910 align:start position:0%
so as far as the schedule goes yeah uh
the

01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
23rd division budget deadline is really
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
the day we ask
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
our office really asks for the divisions
 
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
to finish their decisions because that
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
gives us essentially one work day and
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
that weekend to turn everything around
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
for that Monday which is likely be the
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
day that we present
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
the divisions will present their work to
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
the 27th 28th and 29th possibly would be
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
when the full committee will exec not
 
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
only house bill one and two but the 51
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
other bills that we have I'm assuming
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
unless unless they schedule another
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
exact session in between but all of the
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
bills that we're retaining we have to go
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
through the motions and do a full
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee vote to actually retain
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
and that's that's customary that's
 
01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.990 align:start position:0%
and that's that's customary that's
normal

01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
normal
 
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.370 align:start position:0%
normal
last

01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
term didn't we do the retained bills
 
01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:03.649 align:start position:0%
term didn't we do the retained bills
afterwards

01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
so all the bills have to be reported by
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
that day which is
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
the 30th but we can report retain we
 
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
report retain thank you yeah and then we
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
have the whole summer and have to do a
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
final retained Bill report by whatever
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
the day is October November which is
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
ought to pass itl Amendment whatever and
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
then that'll be the first session of
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
so you can see on here we're gonna we'll
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
lose the ninth we have a session this
 
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
lose the ninth we have a session this
week

01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
and we'll lose the 23rd but again that's
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
our deadline day anyway so I don't and I
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
will say some of you have maybe done
 
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
this before I'm not sure we haven't we
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
definitely didn't do it two years ago
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
because we were remote we've actually
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
had situations and I yeah I hope I don't
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
bring this up where we where you've been
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
in Committee in the state house and then
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
you run up for a roll call to vote and
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
then like that's happened before
 
01:38:00.169 --> 01:38:00.179 align:start position:0%
um it's not an ideal situation but
 
01:38:02.570 --> 01:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just the nature of the
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
scheduling and the volume of work so I'm
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
looking at that week of the 21st 22nd
 
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
23rd is you may be in session and we
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
meeting at the same time if we don't if
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have everything done by then
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
I remember that so it's trying to get up
 
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
the stairs when they yell yeah
 
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:27.649 align:start position:0%
the stairs when they yell yeah
divisions

01:38:27.649 --> 01:38:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
we we well I I we can meet we haven't
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
noticed yet but we can it's still within
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
time that we can notice Friday uh we
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
also already have in the books a work
 
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.570 align:start position:0%
also already have in the books a work
session

01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
for I should have actually included it
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
on here so we've got a budget work
 
01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.189 align:start position:0%
on here so we've got a budget work
session

01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Bill's Work session tomorrow
 
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
at 10 but I also booked at one o'clock a
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
budget work session so if we get done
 
01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
the bills and you want to use that time
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
for anything tomorrow it is noticed so
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
we could meet tomorrow after all those
 
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.629 align:start position:0%
we could meet tomorrow after all those
bills

01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
if we were going to do that
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
what would what would the topics be and
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
that and that's up to the committee we
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
also have Wednesday scheduled at 10
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock as all day essentially wide open
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh my my goal today was to kind of throw
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
everything out there and then maybe as a
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
group we can decide who we want to hear
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
from because we know we
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
definitely any of the Department of
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
Education in uh you're definitely going
 
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
to want Department of Safety and
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
transportation I would think to at least
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
go through the house bill two sections
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
and in a little bit more detail
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
um but as far as even within those maybe
 
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
education is the bigger one like what
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
specifically do you want just so we have
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
the right people here
 
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
quick question yeah
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
um I uh you know
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
a couple of us were able to uh you know
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
take advantage of an invitation from UNH
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
to look over the facilities of the
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
whitemore center and whatnot and as part
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the discussions during that visit
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
their athletic director and other people
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
involved were asking whether you know it
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
would be useful for them to explain the
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
need to the committee or if it would not
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
be a good use of time I just wanted to
 
01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:09.659 align:start position:0%
bring that up now while we are still
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about planning I don't know
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
whether we'd feel the need for that or
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
not obviously you know I cannot you know
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
two of us in this room have been there
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
so you know we can say what we've seen
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
but I you know whichever way this
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
committee would like to go about it they
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
are available for that but I told them I
 
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
cannot say that it would be great to
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
come here because our schedule is brutal
 
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether it's time well
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
spent or not right I support I can't
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
believe I'm saying this but I support
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
the hockey Rick
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
um and I do so
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I've heard from a number of people
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
who are I highly respect about it's not
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
just the hockey rink they're trying to
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
make this an Enterprise facility
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
so that by putting the money into it
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
bring in thousands of people for various
 
01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.350 align:start position:0%
bring in thousands of people for various
different

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
um entertainment venues or
 
01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%
um they can offer it up as as for rent
 
01:41:08.219 --> 01:41:09.169 align:start position:0%
um they can offer it up as as for rent
for

01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
um school teams and a lot of different
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
reasons so I was really impressed with
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that I heard
 
01:41:17.209 --> 01:41:17.219 align:start position:0%
through my computer
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
um so I shocking myself to say that I
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
support this actually even though I
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
kidded the governor should be about
 
01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.209 align:start position:0%
kidded the governor should be about
football

01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
football
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
basically when I really feel strongly
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we need to bring the University
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
Systems budget up to 100 billion dollars
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think you know that's what it was back
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
in 2011 and it was cut drastically
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
um in uh shortly I can't remember
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the was it 2011 it was cut
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes and it was they were just decimated
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
and if we could get them back up to the
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
100 million I think that would be a good
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
thing I think they're already at 99 so
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even take very much money to
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
get them there
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe I can add
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and this is obviously not the entire
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
amount that they're going to need in
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
order to build the structure
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
um but it's a huge boost for them in
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
raising the private funds and to have a
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
partnership public-private partnership
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
to get the rest of the money to have
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
this in there so it's I think is it 30
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
million was that what it was around it's
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
over 30 and about they'll have slightly
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
over 10 from the University funds eight
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
from the general fund and the rest race
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
through uh you know from private funds
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
and it's not even just the ring itself
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
actually that's probably going to be the
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
least affected part it's really the
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure part of the building the
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
local rooms their facilities right now
 
01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.689 align:start position:0%
local rooms their facilities right now
are

01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
very very old and you know 25 years in
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
sports a lot of things changed in just
 
01:42:58.970 --> 01:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
the needs for what it takes and uh you
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
know I'll bring the materials they gave
 
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
us and you know explain if the committee
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
would like but I just didn't I wanted to
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
bring this up also to make sure that if
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
we schedule things if the committee
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
feels that it would be valuable to hear
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
from them you know they are more than
 
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
I'm good yeah so that will simplify
 
01:43:21.239 --> 01:43:25.790 align:start position:0%
I'm good yeah so that will simplify
things

01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
I have to say I'm
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a little lost between the governor's
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
budget blazing means forecast
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
and then what's in here and what's not
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
and possibly by
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
I mean tomorrow I think we have a pretty
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
big workload I mean we've been going
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
through bills pretty quickly retained
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
but I think the ones tomorrow could have
 
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion and we may have
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks coming in is my guess and
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's up to you Mr chair and the
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee who you want to hear from it's
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing of course but it's
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
whoever the committee wants to hear from
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
to do its work
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um we may have time on the back end I
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
scheduled that just as a just in case
 
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
but uh if not Wednesday I think we could
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
probably fill a couple hours with the
 
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
doe again so just jumping back to this
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
busy sheet here they had provided after
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
their uh presentation to us
 
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:28.139 align:start position:0%
so they had only brought forward the
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
school security the five million dollars
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
a year as part of their uh plan then
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
they had the accountability plans
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
administrator they've noticed a couple
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars worth of
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
position funding errors in their budget
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
and then they're also seeking
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
consideration for enhancing some
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
positions that are vacant now to fund
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
them at levels they think are necessary
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
to hire so we haven't really heard from
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Department on those requests as well
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
as a lot of the House Bill 2 sections
 
01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
that they didn't get to so perhaps we we
 
01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.649 align:start position:0%
that they didn't get to so perhaps we we
could

01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
bring the doe if they're available back
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
in Monday uh Wednesday I'm sorry to go
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
through those requests and the house
 
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
bill two sections that works okay we're
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of Education
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
tomorrow they're all education bills and
 
01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
then I'll check their availability for
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
for Wednesday to go over all those okay
 
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
because we have positions in hb2 that we
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
don't even know if the department wants
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
and uh the other position too the bill
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
we retained the data analyst position I
 
01:45:29.689 --> 01:45:29.699 align:start position:0%
think I don't think we did that with
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
them here when we retained that bill so
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
we could talk about that position as
 
01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.470 align:start position:0%
we could talk about that position as
well

01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
I think that was house bill
 
01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.390 align:start position:0%
I think that was house bill
oh

01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
542 one of our retain bills so when
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're talking about their position
 
01:45:44.810 --> 01:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
changes and the uh accountability plan
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
position we can talk about that data
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that'll fill an entire
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
day or if it'll just be the morning it's
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
hard to predict how much will get done
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
at any given time
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so I'd hate to leave a whole
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
afternoon wide open so we could maybe
 
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
trying to think of what we could do that
 
01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
afternoon maybe I'll come up with some
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
by tomorrow but right now they're
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
generic work section sessions on purpose
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
so we can be flexible I know some
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
committees will say you know make it
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
very clear what they're doing that time
 
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
which is nice but having a generic work
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
session for the on the budget gives you
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility to
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
any work session you can you can make
 
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
your tentative votes your
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations doesn't have to be
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
posted as anything else we've been
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
voting right now I mean yeah any any of
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
these meetings that we're at or
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
true

01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
oh I know I mean if if we're gonna have
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
so what are you envisioning tomorrow
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon is that can doe stick
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
around for that afternoon or what will
 
01:47:08.810 --> 01:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
we be what's your plans in the morning
 
01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:10.940 align:start position:0%
huh what we didn't finish in the morning
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
if we do yeah I'm fairly certain we'll
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
run into the afternoon to take a break
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and come back in the afternoon those
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
bills are not they're all scheduled at
 
01:47:22.129 --> 01:47:22.139 align:start position:0%
10 so we can take them in order we can
 
01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
break as needed just recess until a
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
certain time and come back and finish
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
where we left off a few in particular I
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
just think May
 
01:47:33.490 --> 01:47:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
529 I think is um a bill that will maybe
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
want to ponder on a little bit
 
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
um and representative Ladd and um
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative luno will probably talk
 
01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
to that and we looking at what the
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
governor's formula is in addition to
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of the elements of 529 we may come
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
up with a very nice formula
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a school funding bill it's um if
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
you recall in the last session we had it
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's got disparity in it and um the
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
additional free and reduced lunch Aid
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
and hands-free reduced lunch hey so this
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
was what was in place
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
in 20
 
01:48:25.149 --> 01:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
this was when actually Senator Khan and
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
and representative Luna worked on Ed
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
funding back in that biennium yeah yeah
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
and then so the first four bills that
 
01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
day could go quick then we've got two
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
EFA bills and then a charter school bill
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
two Ed funding bills and then the
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification bill so
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
those are those are pretty significant
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
issues you may get a lot of uh testimony
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming representative Ladd and
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Luna will be here
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
like they were with the other education
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
bills so
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
I think we'll get a lot tomorrow
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
the 601
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
601 I I believe the nutrition people
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
will be here I think I told them when
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
they called me that we were of a single
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
mind in division two that we supported
 
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:14.699 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid direct certification
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
I hope I wasn't out of line doing that
 
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
but it seemed that we were all really
 
01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that there's another
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
I mean as of now
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned I think it would
 
01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
be a good idea to consider replacing the
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
fnr with numbers based on that does not
 
01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
mean I support that bill has passed
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
which would increase which would include
 
01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:40.090 align:start position:0%
which would increase which would include
actually

01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:40.100 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
participating in the direct
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
certification so as far as we are
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the school funding formula
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
itself yes other policy parts of that
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill not so much just to make sure we
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
are on the same page okay just to let
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
you know too that it will not even be
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
possible for us to
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
um apply because the it's the
 
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
program pilot is not open fully
 
01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:07.970 align:start position:0%
program pilot is not open fully
understood

01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
but we could we could
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
we could all if I may
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
if we could authorize it authorized to
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
join the program if it comes available I
 
01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
mean we could we could put language in
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh and exactly that's when I spoke with
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
um the folks from the Department if we
 
01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
have that authorization in place then
 
01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
they can go forward when in fact it
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
becomes available
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
so they have because right now from what
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
I understand we've never given that
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
authorization to the commissioner I was
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
of another mind I thought he had that
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
authorization but we never gave it to
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
him as far as I know so um by doing that
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
I think that puts that in place and they
 
01:50:53.689 --> 01:50:53.699 align:start position:0%
just gets it out of the way they have
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
that power if they want it my
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
understanding it's using the statistics
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid not the actual names
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
so never
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it was not a data link for
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
individuals it was just using the stats
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
of the uh from Medicaid okay yeah
 
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
because you could do it by ZIP code ZIP
 
01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:13.850 align:start position:0%
because you could do it by ZIP code ZIP
code

01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
the way we discuss using it in the
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
education formula would still basically
 
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
just be statistics aggregated no
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
individual information whatsoever again
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
actual direct certification totally
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
different ball of wax but as far as
 
01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:30.659 align:start position:0%
school funding is concerned using those
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
numbers would not have any privacy
 
01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
concerns or anything
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
but that would also resolve the problem
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
not getting the parents to submit the
 
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.370 align:start position:0%
not getting the parents to submit the
forms

01:51:39.370 --> 01:51:39.380 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
as a former Title One director
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
getting parents to fill out those forms
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
is near to impossible for my city of
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester for example we have a certain
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
number of students that um do apply but
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's at least three times more
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester has actually Manchester asked
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
that we submit this bill because for
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
them it will save them so much time and
 
01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
they will have actual accurate numbers
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
that they've never had before for that
 
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
reason because they don't fill out the
 
01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:12.530 align:start position:0%
reason because they don't fill out the
forms

01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
forms
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
right and and just collecting the forms
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
and and putting the data together at the
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
school you know an administrator and
 
01:52:25.129 --> 01:52:25.139 align:start position:0%
then you've got to certify a certain I
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
think it's three percent and then so you
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
have to chase those parents and if they
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
don't give you the data then those kids
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
are off of uh free and reduced lunch
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
which is you know that's and that takes
 
01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
a lot it's a lot of administration time
 
01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:42.500 align:start position:0%
just a quick note that I've heard
 
01:52:45.490 --> 01:52:45.500 align:start position:0%
sorry reasonable objections to the
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
automatic enrollment that people who
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
qualified for Medicaid into the free and
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
reduce lunch program that in a sense you
 
01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:54.290 align:start position:0%
reduce lunch program that in a sense you
are

01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people choose not to enroll
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
because you know there is a stigma
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
because they want to protect their
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
privacy and so on and so forth I do
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely support you know looking into
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
using those numbers aggregated and so on
 
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so forth for the purpose of
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
replacing the fnr portion of the formula
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
with something that's more accurate but
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't necessarily even be
 
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
comfortable supporting the policy goal
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
of using the Medicaid data to enroll
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
kids directly into the free and you know
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
free reduced lunch I I just clarifying
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
again where I'm coming from so there are
 
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
concerns but if we are just looking at
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
the funding you know formula I think
 
01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm very comfortable with
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
that beyond that it becomes complicated
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
to a no to you know if you take these
 
01:53:43.330 --> 01:53:43.340 align:start position:0%
two arguments and you put them together
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
what you've got is a slush fund no no no
 
01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.139 align:start position:0%
no no just listen
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
right now they're having trouble getting
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
parents to apply for it okay we're going
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem
 
01:53:56.689 --> 01:53:56.699 align:start position:0%
statistically we're going to take the
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid numbers and we'll say Okay 14
 
01:54:02.689 --> 01:54:02.699 align:start position:0%
of your school district is qualified for
 
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
f r
 
01:54:08.209 --> 01:54:08.219 align:start position:0%
so we pay him based on 14 percent
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's still got to apply for it to
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
get it
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
the student's still going to have to
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
bring a piece of paper in right so now
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
we've got 14 we're paying for and they
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
only get six percent right that register
 
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
for it because the school do they know
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
they don't I mean how do they know
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
somebody's on Medicaid
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
please if we were to do Medicaid direct
 
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:35.890 align:start position:0%
please if we were to do Medicaid direct
certification

01:54:35.890 --> 01:54:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
School data
 
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
confidentially linked
 
01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.070 align:start position:0%
confidentially linked
so

01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
this info would key into the school
 
01:54:56.090 --> 01:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
identification right
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
using the i4c system
 
01:55:02.169 --> 01:55:02.179 align:start position:0%
and then that would
 
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
give the school a list
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
a confidential list only to a person who
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
is authorized and has signed off saying
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
it is confidential information not to be
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
distributed or used by anybody there are
 
01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
strict guidelines okay now let's keep
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
your scenario in place now let's carry
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
that into implementation and then the
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
children would be eligible for free and
 
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch would somebody has to tell
 
01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:28.729 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch would somebody has to tell
them

01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
that would be the responsibility of the
 
01:55:31.199 --> 01:55:32.450 align:start position:0%
that would be the responsibility of the
school

01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
okay now if we're talking about stigma
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
to say parents could refuse it
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
uh yeah because they already do that now
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
they do it with TANF and snap programs
 
01:55:45.590 --> 01:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes they automatically automatically
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's a list and it it just comes down
 
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.330 align:start position:0%
it's a list and it it just comes down
and

01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
if they they don't the parents don't
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
even have to make out a floor TANF and
 
01:55:57.169 --> 01:55:57.179 align:start position:0%
snap are in the original agriculture
 
01:55:57.179 --> 01:55:58.609 align:start position:0%
snap are in the original agriculture
legislation

01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:56:01.370 --> 01:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid hadn't come to be yet that's
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
why it didn't get into the legislation
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this outlier and
 
01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's why the need Now 37 states are
 
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
already doing this
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
so over time I think we'll get to 50
 
01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.229 align:start position:0%
so over time I think we'll get to 50
states

01:56:17.229 --> 01:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
but the the real
 
01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
the important most important of all of
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
it is that more kids would get
 
01:56:29.590 --> 01:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
a feeding program right which is good
 
01:56:33.169 --> 01:56:33.179 align:start position:0%
and the second piece is that in terms of
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula we would have more
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
accurate numbers to go from which is
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
good for our state it's good for school
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
districts it's good it's good all the
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
way around
 
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
so Mr just a quick note
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
my concern the way where I'm coming you
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
know when I'm talking about using the
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid instead of the 300 use is that
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly that portion
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy is meant to compensate
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
school districts you know because the
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
assumption is when they have more people
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
who live in poverty they are less likely
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to raise adequate funds to
 
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
provide education so in the intent for
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
the funds that are part of that other
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
Quest is not to pay for lunch itself but
 
01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
give the school additional funding so
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
they can provide comparable education
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
even though their tax base may not be
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
able to correct me if I'm wrong but
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
based on that you know right now the
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
fact that all those kids in schools
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
during kovid did not have to file for
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
free and clear to just you know get free
 
01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
food severely decrease the incentive of
 
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
any parent to fill that paperwork and
 
01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:43.139 align:start position:0%
you know right now we are underfunding
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
schools who should get more money
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
because the number of students register
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
this below so the intent is to correct
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
that imbalance and just take the same
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
amount of money but allocate it
 
01:57:57.890 --> 01:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
correctly you know so that you know
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
schools get it in the exact ratios that
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
they are you know or that they deserve
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
based on the number of people who meet
 
01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:10.139 align:start position:0%
the statistically correct right at the
 
01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:13.139 align:start position:0%
you know District level so in that sense
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
I think using those numbers in the
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula instead of the free and
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
reduced would be a significant step
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
forward because it's better quality data
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
it better measures
 
01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
what we originally meant to measure
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
through free and reduced
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
those numbers yet not we're still going
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
to continue I believe the same way we
 
01:58:35.089 --> 01:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
are right now we don't have to we're
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
using the statistical numbers not it's
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
not that's not well I mean that's that
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
would have to be
 
01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:42.290 align:start position:0%
would have to be
um

01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
authorized we'd have to say we'd have to
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
give the risk Department about that
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
Authority right correct but hb2 I mean I
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
think we're I think we're all in
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
agreement there uh my my issue has to do
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
with the gap of if we're just going to
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
authorize it for a school district and
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
send them a check
 
01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
what happens it's it's funding
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
how do I self-identify if I don't
 
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
self-identify now why am I going to
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
well the parents are not submitting the
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
forms they know they're eligible they're
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
not submitting the forms what's changing
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
because we use Medicaid data other than
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
more money going to the schools well
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's a reimbursement program so the kids
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
have to take the meals before they
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement comes but um the
 
01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
difference will be
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
Mickey help me if I have this wrong the
 
01:59:40.089 --> 01:59:40.099 align:start position:0%
difference will be
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid numbers
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
will link with student data and so
 
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
schools will be notified of those people
 
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
that are eligible and those families
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
will be notified of their eligibility
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
without having to fill out a form
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay so we're basically taking over the
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility from the parents well
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
educator there are many parents who are
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
number one those families that have
 
02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
English as a second language have
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
difficulty doing that
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
um parents sometimes just never get to
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
it because they either don't care or
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
they don't want to or whatever for
 
02:00:30.649 --> 02:00:30.659 align:start position:0%
whatever there are a million reasons and
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
some don't understand the paperwork
 
02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
getting parents to fill out anything is
 
02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:37.490 align:start position:0%
getting parents to fill out anything is
difficult

02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
um so having to put down your
 
02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
information parents are very reluctant
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
to do that and I understand why I mean
 
02:00:49.129 --> 02:00:49.139 align:start position:0%
it's it's personal information and they
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't they don't know who's going to be
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
looking at those forms I get it
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
um so there are a myriad of reasons and
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
then the worst part of all is when
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking in the face of a hungry
 
02:01:01.609 --> 02:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
kid and you know that they should be
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for from reduced lunch and
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so it well it's hard
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
when we had everybody eligible during
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
covet it was wonderful because everybody
 
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
ate I remember my daughter telling me at
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
Central High School they'd come in
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
they'd bring boxes and boxes of lunches
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
everybody ate nobody thought about free
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
and reduced nobody thought about
 
02:01:25.609 --> 02:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
anything they just thought about I'm a
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
high school kid I'm hungry and I'm gonna
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
eat it was wonderful and and there was a
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
lot of conversation right now about how
 
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
well free the free lunch program went
 
02:01:38.209 --> 02:01:38.219 align:start position:0%
and is there money at the federal level
 
02:01:41.089 --> 02:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
to do that across the country so and
 
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
like you're shaking ahead right now
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opposition to that I
 
02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%
don't see it as taking responsibility
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
away from parents as much as enabling an
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
easier path for the parents to achieve
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
something for their students that they
 
02:01:55.729 --> 02:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
probably do want their kids to eat and
 
02:01:57.169 --> 02:01:57.179 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like instead of me having
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
to keep track of my passport and when
 
02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm due I get a notification I get a
 
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
notification when my driver's license is
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
renewed and I can just push a button and
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
and get my so it's away it makes the
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
path easier doesn't take away the
 
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility as far as I'm concerned
 
02:02:13.609 --> 02:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
but enables them to do it a little bit
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
easier and it's hard to there are
 
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are barriers for
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
some parents to achieve some of this
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
some of it their own fault some of it
 
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
not their own faults so it's it makes
 
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
the path easier to make sure their kids
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
get fed we should get back to this
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
though because tomorrow we're going to
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
be having this conversation again
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
important to be sitting there if I may
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
would have just 15 seconds
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
the head shaking thing was indeed in
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
regards to the concept of fully free
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
lunches for everybody because trust me I
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
know how much
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
would waste results in situations like
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
that and also I don't think it's our
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
place to you know feed the kids from
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
families like mine who can very well
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
take care of the needs of the kids for
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
lunch we need to focus on you know the
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
need to feed the kids with families
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
cannot afford good food and I would not
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
be comfortable with expanding this to
 
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
everybody because of a lot of reasons
 
02:03:14.089 --> 02:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
more than I would like to get into in
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
the 30 seconds I'm trying to stick to
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
we got to make sure every kid you know
 
02:03:23.330 --> 02:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
has another option absolutely
 
02:03:26.089 --> 02:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
the point of this is that we if we want
 
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
to do this it's
 
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're setting up a pattern so they can
 
02:03:38.209 --> 02:03:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.219 --> 02:03:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah there's some the department can
 
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that tomorrow the big impact
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
would be in fiscal 26 when you see the
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
result of the direct certification
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
impact the adequacy formula but that
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
won't affect the 24-25 biennium by the
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
time it goes into effect
 
02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be until outside this
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium all right
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
anything else today folks
 
02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
I I will point out that I think GNC
 
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
meets on Wednesday so I'll do my best to
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
see who is available to come see us but
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
some folks may be tied up with that
 
02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:20.870 align:start position:0%
some folks may be tied up with that
um

02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
looking ahead so we do have Friday the
 
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
10th as a potential day is that a day
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
that it's fine with me if we could come
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
up with yeah I'll see I'll see who's
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
available that day
 
02:04:33.179 --> 02:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
available that day
um

02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
I'll see if we can get anyone in before
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
and then I think as long as we post it
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
by sometimes Wednesday we'll be good
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
um is town meeting in town meeting day a
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
day you still want to try to get
 
02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be here I will be
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
I think we could do a half day okay I
 
02:05:07.689 --> 02:05:07.699 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
02:05:07.699 --> 02:05:09.910 align:start position:0%
think it's
I

02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't vote because you brought me to
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
conquered perhaps sometime between now
 
02:05:18.890 --> 02:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
and you know middle of this week when we
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
have to notice for next week we'll we'll
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
know about perhaps the public hearing
 
02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
because I think I said I think we're
 
02:05:25.490 --> 02:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
gonna lose a day at some point here to
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
do the house bill one and two public
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hearing in reps Hall I don't know when
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to be yet
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
but I assume it'll be sometime between
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
now and the 23rd
 
02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
now and the 23rd
um

02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
13th the 13th is probably about unless
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
again unless uh something full
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
committees scheduled that day like the
 
02:05:46.930 --> 02:05:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
Wednesday oh right right yeah Wednesday
 
02:05:54.250 --> 02:05:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay I know that was yeah I'll double
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.679 --> 02:06:06.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.410 --> 02:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I think yeah I think
 
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
I think we've got enough for this week
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
knowing that we've already got tomorrow
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon available and all day
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and then I can do the Friday
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
the 10th as well hopefully by then we'll
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
have some clarity on full committee
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
stuff that may interfere with what we
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
want to do and then once we fill those
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
in then we can work around that okay
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to check with chair Weiler
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
as far as dates for like I said the full
 
02:06:33.290 --> 02:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
committee exec usually we do those bills
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
when we do House Bill one and two
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
usually we also do another executive
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
session to dispose of some of those
 
02:06:42.109 --> 02:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
bills ahead of time which we haven't
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
done we don't have that scheduled and
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've got like 50 bills so that last
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
week I got to think 27 28 29 the
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee will have plenty of stuff to
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:51.709 align:start position:0%
committee will have plenty of stuff to
do

02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:06:51.719 --> 02:06:53.089 align:start position:0%
do
um

02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:53.099 --> 02:06:56.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
24th is fiscal yeah
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh it could be one actually I think
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's I think I it usually is 10 but
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
the last couple have been one for some
 
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:07.609 align:start position:0%
the last couple have been one for some
reason

02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:08.870 align:start position:0%
reason
um

02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
but but my hope is you're done by the
 
02:07:13.490 --> 02:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
the day before that so hopefully this
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact that so hopefully fiscal
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact our work
 
02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:19.970 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact our work
um

02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:22.129 --> 02:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's where we are I think
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
we've got some days as long as we don't
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
have any crazy weather or any other
 
02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:27.950 align:start position:0%
have any crazy weather or any other
surprises

02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
surprises
 
02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:28.490 align:start position:0%
surprises
um

02:07:28.490 --> 02:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:30.470 align:start position:0%
um
everything

02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:37.729 align:start position:0%
everything
again

02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
literally every day other than March 14
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
be back at it tomorrow morning
 
02:07:52.619 --> 02:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
