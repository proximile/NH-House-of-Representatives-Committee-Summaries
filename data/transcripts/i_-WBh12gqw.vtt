00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:19.749 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open the work session we're
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to actually skip over 1589 we're
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for an amendment on that um we
 
00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 align:start position:0%
will go next to the collection of um 318
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
1 005 and 252 and I believe
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire has an amendment
 
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
which you should all have in front of
 
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.430 align:start position:0%
which you should all have in front of
you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
1375 yeah thank you Mr chairman so this
 
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
is just a piece right our our the plan
 
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
that I I did with uh Mr Hoffman was to
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
combine all three of these bills
 
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
105 318
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
252 into a single comprehensive bill
 
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
which would be House Bill
 
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
318 and the reason we picked House Bill
 
00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 align:start position:0%
318 as the final bill is that way
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
because it's a house bill it will have a
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in the Senate and
 
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
therefore um if there's more issues that
 
00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
we somehow overlooked which I'm hoping
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
not um then you know they could be
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
resolved over there whereas if we picked
 
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 252 then it would just
 
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
possibly have a committee of conference
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
so so my what I'm hoping we'll do is put
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
all the stuff all the changes we were
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
talking about into house bill 318 and
 
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
make House Bill 105 and Senate Bill 252
 
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
itl so the first one is this is the
 
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 105 piece so it's effectively
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
copied from House Bill
 
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
105 with the addition of training of
 
00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners which you find on
 
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
17 um that was copied from one of these
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
other bills and um the one difference
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
that will be in the final one you see on
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
line 18 it says the chief magistrate
 
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to be replaced with um the
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
judicial training
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
coordinator right so uh it it's the
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
judicial training coordinator that will
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
be doing all this training organizing
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
all the training and on if you look on
 
00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
page one line 15 you'll see magistrates
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
and bail Commissioners were added to
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
that line which wasn't in House Bill 105
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
but other than that this is a mostly
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
House Bill
105

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
105
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
um you know with all the hours put back
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
and and all that stuff right so at the
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
top of page two you see all those all
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
it are there questions for
 
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
it are there questions for
representative

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
chair I
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
just um are we going to stick with the
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
$50 even though there was some
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
discussion in your amendment I thought
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
to moving it to 60 because of what the
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
sen that's a second decision I
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
think um I can I mean I could talk about
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
yet yeah the other this $60 amendment is
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
out there as well but this is what the
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill Commissioners shall be paid for
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
their training time
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
for each eight hour block of training I
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
believe and I was just looking back at
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
one5 as we received it and I don't there
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
was no money in there initially for the
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
training it just said that they were
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to require training
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
but is that as you recall it yeah it
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
sort of implied that we're adding a
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
position here right and so that's going
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
so representative Maguire there's no
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
change we talked about a Bill Amend or
 
00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.990 align:start position:0%
change we talked about a Bill Amend or
Amendment

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
1113 last week and that was the whole
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
discussion around shell and May and
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here to yeah so
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
essentially we we are going back to the
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
original house um language there um we
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
do have on line 12 under the direction
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the Chief
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
Justice right so the chief justice is
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
the the boss of this
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
person yeah
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
okay further questions uh saying none
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative cells are you okay moving
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
the amendment along or yes I'll move the
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a second
 
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.390 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a second
representative

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
Sweeny further discussion on the
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
amendment uh marford by representative
 
00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:31.869 align:start position:0%
amendment uh marford by representative
Maguire

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
Maguire
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
1375 H I guess we can just again with
 
00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
the understanding that page two line 18
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
will not be the chief magistrate it'll
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
be the judge the the um judicial
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
training Court yeah yeah
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative EV question so
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
so is the uh just getting back to the sh
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
and the May and the great concern that
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch had because you've
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
added I just want to put it out there on
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
the record because you have the language
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
in here under the direction of the chief
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
justice is the idea that that can give
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
some wiggle room to the training hour
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
requirement right okay so I just that's
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
what I thought so I just thought I would
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
say it here in the executive session so
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
that was clear from a constitutional
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
you I'll give a little attitude Aon
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of a vote
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
but I I apologize Mr chairman I
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I do see that there is
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
um at the direction of the chief justice
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
for the training coordinator but not for
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
the training
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
requirements um
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
so obviously the legislature can can
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
take the votes it wants to take but I
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that my advice is
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
that this is an
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so effectively here I
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
came down on the side of um chairman
 
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
Lynn in this
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.509 align:start position:0%
Lynn in this
[Laughter]

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
argument yeah I mean again you know I
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
had originally gone along and and
 
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
proposed taking out all those hours
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
right but then we got pushed back from
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn and and uh representative
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
Smith who said they like these hours in
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
there right so there they are any
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
further any further and we also heard I
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
mean just to be fair I mean we also
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
heard that these are these are lower
 
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
than they probably will want to do
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
so are we okay with the show of
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
hands all those in favor of the OT
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
motion put their hand
 
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
up those
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
opposed unanimous oh one I'm sorry I
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
just no that's s right yeah no
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
problem okay H1 Amendment 8 to one on
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
now okay now you have another amendment
 
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.110 align:start position:0%
now okay now you have another amendment
right

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
representa I don't know what state
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're in so we we talked you know I I
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
spent time with with Mike um on Friday
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
creating you know asking for things
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
but all right thank
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
you okay so this is one I have haven't
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
um this should be the comprehensive
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
thing so we should go through it section
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
guess okay all right before we go
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
through it representative Maguire I
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
think all the division members may have
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
received an email from chairman Roy on
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
the number of magistrates and I know
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that representative Maguire would like
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
to comment on the letter and maybe even
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
read his letter yeah so what I would
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
like to do since he couldn't be here is
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
just I'll read you what he wrote and I
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
had responded to it and then he wrote
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
again so I'd like to read the whole
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
series if you don't mind okay so dear
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is from chairman Roy to to us and a
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of others uh dear division one
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
members I am aware that you will will be
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
conducting further work on the bail
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
bills today to to include further
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
magistrates it was my hope to attend in
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
person but I have medical appointments
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
and so on um as my committee and house
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
duties require me to oh anyways this is
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
about appointments he's he's unable to
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
attend okay it is my understanding that
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
at the request of Representative Sweeney
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
you are contemplating cutting the number
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
of magistrates from 15 to 5 I've gone
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
over the number proposed and it will not
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to cover the policy or
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
achieve the broader goals not the least
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
of which being lowering the cost to our
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
counties I'm not sure what evidence you
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
relied on to arrive at the number five
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
but cutting from 15 to five in an effort
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
to lower the cost totally negates the
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
policy in which in and of itself is
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
designed to cut costs the magistrates
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
will save taxpayers money in the broader
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
impact of the policy despite
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
representatives scitec and ly's
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
protestations the magistrates are
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to make the system work
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
without holding someone longer than
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
necessary please keep in mind that the
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
cost to our counties of keeping these
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
people even two days longer than
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
necessary during our six months of
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
hearings we heard from the counties
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the medical expenses of any of
 
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.509 align:start position:0%
regarding the medical expenses of any of
these

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
arrestes as the county is on the hook
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
for them and Medicare does not pay while
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated I'm presuming he means
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but anyway it can be
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
enormous uh if an arrestd comes in with
 
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
no medication for a chronic condition
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
some of the medications cost thousands
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
just for a week's Supply when someone is
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
held for months pending trial the
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
medical cost can be astronomic iCal we
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that some inmates can
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
require medication that can run into
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars per month I
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
would call your attention to the duties
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
of the magistrates Beyond bail please
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
recall that we carefully studied the
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
increased burden on the already overly
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
burdened court
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
system uh the changes to the bail syst
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
system will cause as such the policy
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
provides broad duties for magistrates
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that will free judges to handle other
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
matters to Al alleviate the bottleneck
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
currently we have people waiting
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes up to a year to have their
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
cases heard while they are waiting if
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
they are being held due to the changes
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:22.519 align:start position:0%
making the cost for this goes on the
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
county governments the most expensive of
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
these being the medical costs I
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
referenced above the answer to the the
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
answer is to move these cases through
 
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.710 align:start position:0%
answer is to move these cases through
more

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
expeditiously when judges have more room
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
on their docket to conduct criminal
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
trials and motion hearings because they
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
are not spending entire days holding
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
arraignments and bail hearings the
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
system moves faster and people are
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
either released per a plea found not
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
guilty or sentenced to a state
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
facility please review the entire list
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
of their duties number one at the
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
discretion of the Chief Justice of the
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in consultation with the
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the superior court and
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative judge of the Circuit
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
Court magistrates may have the following
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
powers a to determine the release or
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
Detention of defendants on all days of
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
the week and at all times of day

pursuant to RSA 597 colon 2 B to conduct

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
to perform such other acts and functions
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
as authorized by the Chief Justice of
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court not inconsistent with
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire con tion or any other
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
state and federal
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
law they then they there are their
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities related to bail
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners themselves they are
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing the bail
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners within their counties that
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
includes recruitment training retention
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
and coverage as you can see these 15
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
people will not only handle the serious
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
bail cases on nights and weekends but
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
will also be a forced multiply for our
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
judges as I said a after original
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
arraignment it is not unusual for
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
criminal case to take six months to a
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
year to be resolved cases do not get
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
better during that time the prosecution
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
and defense often loses witnesses that
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
are key to provide proving either guilt
 
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
are key to provide proving either guilt
or

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
innocent um the defend defendant loses
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
any employment they may have had causing
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
the family to go on public assistance
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
and lose housing the ripple effect of
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
delayed case resolutions is Broad from
 
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
from the cost to our counties to the
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
Lost freedom of our citizens delay
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
Justice is not only Justice denied but
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
is far more expensive for our taxpayers
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
than the cost of these 15
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
employees there is also the electronic
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
monitoring aspect of the bail reform
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
package the magistrates also give the
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
court the ability to have them be the
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
contact person for violations of
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring conditions
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
with their ability to issue warrants if
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
a defendant is released on electronic
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
monitoring the court will likely
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
contract this monitoring service with a
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
private Company the company will need to
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
inform someone of the violations and
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
preferably that should be someone who
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
can issue a Judicial response in an
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
extremely timely manner as these are
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
people who have violated a protective
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
order I strenuously urge you to go no
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
lower than 10 with the number of
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
magistrates please avoid thinking of
 
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
them as just a more qualified bail
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner the magistrates are the
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
lynchpin of the entire bail reform
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
package and not an add-on they allow us
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
to hold dangerous people by giving them
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
a fair bail review while ensuring public
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
protection they create the ability for
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
judges to hear more cases move the
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
system along faster and more efficiently
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
if you must make a cut I implore your
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
implore you to make it Surgical and with
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts to the broader impact of the
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
entire policy and envisioned by the
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
Committee and supported by the house
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay so that was that one
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
responded um first of all I said if he
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here perhaps he could send
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
someone else from his committee I don't
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
know do we have no we don't have a
 
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.950 align:start position:0%
know do we have no we don't have a
person

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
okay if everyone would just hold off and
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
let represent McGuire read his anyways
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
so here's my response I said um the
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
simple fact is that the number of
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
arrests annually for the serious crimes
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
that you have said in this legislation
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
must be handled by magistrates and not
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners is under
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
1,500 that's roughly 30 per week with
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
five magistrates that's six per week
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
each um we we asked how long does each
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
case take and we were told a half an
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
hour is a reasonable estimate even if it
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
is an hour that still leaves 34 hours a
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
week for each of the five
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
magistrates to help do other things to
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
help the courts we asked whether the
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
current number of
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
Judges with the current number of Judges
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
is the Court's backlog increasing or
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
decreasing it is
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
decreasing therefore all the extra
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
efforts by the magistrates to relieve
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
judges is just an improvement it is not
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
necessary okay um so here's his response
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
to that I would submit to you that to
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
characterize as
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
unnecessary is only accurate if you were
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
looking at the issue of bail of ser ious
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
offenders and ignoring the comprehensive
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
policy addressed in the package of
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
bills with defendants waiting 6 months
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
to a year for their cases to go to trial
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
our the cost to our County governments
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
is enormous our policy committee was not
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
limited to addressing the issue of bail
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
of serious offenses but instead took a
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look at the bail system
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
from arrest to trial which is the
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
duration of when someone is on bail when
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
when we discuss what is and what is not
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
necessary I would submit that we are
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
engaging in a policy
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
discussion the criminal justice and
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Committee spent six months
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
so this somewhat rep repetitive here um
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
investigating what is necessary and to
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
address the deficiencies we discovered
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
in our system you are of course free to
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
disagree with our results on the policy
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
but not what is and what is not
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to a affect the policy I
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
continue to maintain that a bare minimum
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
of 10 magistrates is necessary to affect
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
the holistic policy that our committee
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
put forward on this entire package of
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
bills even limiting to the maners of
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
bail as it becomes more difficult to
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
recruit and maintain sufficient bail
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners their future in the
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is uncertain we have
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
previously discussed that there are
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
possible tax
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
implications related to their status as
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
well therefore it is important to
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
remember that while the crime limited to
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
only judge judges and magistrates is
 
00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:03.310 align:start position:0%
only judge judges and magistrates is
around

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
1,400 the number of bailes made by bail
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is over 10,000 annually I
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you and the committee to
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
please consider the full bread of our
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
policy our committee established and the
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
Full House
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
endorsed okay that's
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
it all right so I guess I still think
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
the five is is reasonable it's it's a
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
step forward ward in the way he wants it
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand this this is not a
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
a budget year uh we gave the Judiciary
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
everything they wanted in the budget
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
they did not ask for
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
magistrates so if they felt that that um
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
the delays in the whole
 
00:22:53.549 --> 00:22:53.559 align:start position:0%
system are were a serious problem they
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
could have asked for them they could
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
have asked for more judges they could
 
00:22:58.269 --> 00:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
have you know so all that sort of stuff
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
and so we're we by adding five we're
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
reducing the backlog we're making
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
progress and so on and and we'll have
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
some experience when comes the next
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
budget as to whether it should be
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
increased or or not so I'm still happy
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
with what we have representative wer
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
followed by representative grassie thank
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair like any new program
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of loose ends who's going
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
to do the interviewing
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
how many will he be able to hire how
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
long will it take I don't think you
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
could find 15 people in a year with some
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
of the requirements you might it might
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
take six months to find five and then
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
how you going to work out the hours you
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
know well we expect you to be in the
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
office when you're not called on
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
weekends okay I spent 30 hours on the
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
weekend on this now how many hours you
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
expect me to work in the office uh and
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's easy on a busy weekend to spend the
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
almost the whole weekend doing that kind
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
of thing so it leaves leaves a lot of
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
loose ends uh we expect you to be in
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
court Monday wait a minute I was up till
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
3: in the morning on Sunday with some
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
idiots in three different courts now you
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
want me there at at 9:00 in the morning
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
on Monday give me a break um that's the
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
way it goes you can't be on call and
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
still have schedules throughout the week
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
that all has to be worked out and you
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
know and so until that's all done and
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
then we see If there really is a savings
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
then it will take a year or two to see
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
if what was the savings where were the
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
savings and all this stuff about all the
 
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
expense for the counties put them out on
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
electronic Monitor and go buy your own
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
drugs if you got $1,000 a week drugs I
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
mean we've run into that before in the
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
county and I think they let them go
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
rather spend that kind of money on drugs
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
and if if they needed that much
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
medication they probably weren't capable
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
of doing much else anyway but just the
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
thought that I'm looking at it as an
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
experimental thing you start off easy
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
see if there was any savings to see if
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
you did find the right people and then
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
go on from there and if you don't find
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
the right people and you can't find the
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
right people because the only one I
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
think that would be qualified for any of
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
this would be a retired judge and how
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
many of them want to work that job I
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
don't know you might have two a
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
three thanks representative
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
grassy thank you Mr chairman I had a
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to a few members of the
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
committee last week about this bill and
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
also and and the number of magistrates
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
in specific I also talked to my and and
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
they brought up the the issue of savings
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
at the county level and I had a chance
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
to talk to my County Administrator and
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
the administrator at our jail and they
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
reinforced that that there was a cost
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
involved here that they felt that this
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
is something that could help alleviate
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
cost at our County levels and you know
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
they they had a significant concern as
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
well as of as of us moving this to five
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
magistrates this was looked at as a
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approaches here I mean
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
we've been struggling with this for a
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
couple of years now and more than one se
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
you know two sessions three sessions
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been talking about bail
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
reform and ba reform has been an
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
important thing at the local level and I
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
think that what you have to take a look
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
at here is that the work that was done
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
by the policy committee and I read
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy's email this morning before
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
I came in I didn't see the respon want
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the thing is is it convinced me that
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have more than five
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
and you know and that's a concern that I
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
have that I think we're going to make
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
this work uh we need to have at least
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
one per County and I understand
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro has two courts so you need one
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
to have two so I think the minimum that
 
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
we need to have is 11 magistrates in
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
order to make this work if we only have
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
five this is not going to work we're
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
going to be back here next year and
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be arguing this again the
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
under trouble is is once you put in five
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
we pass this and we get get five in
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
there it's going to be hard to fix that
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we should we should fix the problem
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
now so we can go back to our voters we
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
go back to our police Chiefs we can go
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
back to our counties and we can say we
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
fixed this and so Mr chairman if it's
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
not inappropriate I'd like to make a
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
motion I vote it on the prevailing side
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
on the bill on magistrates I'd like to
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
reconsider my vote on the uh on the
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
five is there a second to uh
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
representative grass's
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider our vote and uh
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
just a reconsideration I won't take a
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
number but at least to reconsider a vote
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Sweeny thank
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't disagree but I do think
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
that if we set it at five there's
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
currently zero magistrates in the state
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire if we were to set it at
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
five today and it becomes law in June of
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
or July of 202 24 and we can hire those
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
five magistrates and we come to the
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
budget next year and we realize that
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
five isn't enough it is pretty easy to
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
increase that number to S to 9 10 11 as
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
you proposed we would never if we
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
installed 11 and there wasn't enough
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
workload for those magistrates to do
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
we're never shrinking that back down to
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
five so I I still support five as the
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
starting point and acknowledging that it
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
is the starting point and that you know
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
while this legislation is going going to
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
do wonders at reforming the failed bail
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
reform from
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
2018 this is still going to be the
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
starting point of the fixes that will
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
take place and as the system grows as we
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
continue to implement the judicial
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
branches audit that they came to us in
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
the last budget with where we added some
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
judges we added the land use Court Judge
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
we're still expanding the judicial
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
branch over the next few years
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
magistrates are certainly part of that
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
expansion but they're not the total
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
answer towards it as well uh so I think
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to I I sticking to the
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
course of five from this committee uh
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
we'll see how the rest of the house uh
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
wants to respond to that and then the
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
other body on the other side of the wall
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
but five for me works so thank
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
you representative grass yeah I it it's
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
something that I think that you know
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
people are say we we we put the five in
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
and and we should be fine but the thing
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
is I think it's been expressed certainly
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
in in chairman Roy's emails that these
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
magistrates have a lot more to do than
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
Jess Bale and so and there's a lot of
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
backlog in the courts that we have I
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
know they're they're catching up but the
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
thing is it's still the process is far
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
too long we need to move the court
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
system along better than we have and
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
another thing that I found out is that
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
these um these bail Commissioners these
 
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
magistrates do not have to be lawyers or
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
previous judges many of they're looking
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
at the qualifications for these people
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're looking at people who may have
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
been police prosecutors in the past who
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
have a legal knowledge about the system
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
that can step into these jobs as well so
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
they don't feel that they're going to
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
have a problem filling these 15
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
positions at all so uh you know having
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh police prosecutors who or police
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
officers who work for departments local
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
departments uh and and do things at the
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
county level um you know as a town
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
planner I went before Superior Court
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
many of times representing the town when
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
an attorney wasn't necessary so but the
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
thing is is that these are people they
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
feel that they shouldn't have a problem
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
filling these positions and they are
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
people that they need in the system uh
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
and I think this is not only does a good
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
thing as far as bail is concerned but it
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
helps the entire Jud I system so I would
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
stand by my position asking for 11 is
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
what I would what I would ask for uh
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
because I think it is sorely needed in
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
our in our in our
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
state represent Griffin you have
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
something well I you know we went
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
through this whole thing last week and U
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm impressed by representative
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
mcu's analyzing the time and what the uh
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
baill you know what the magistrates
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
would be doing and appears that like
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
five magistrates would be enough and
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
that's the decision we uh we we uh came
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
to there were several of us I think more
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
than one that didn't want the
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
magistrates at
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
all and U it's a compromise and
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
financially it's half the
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
cost and I think we got to start looking
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
at costs cuz I think revenues aren't
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
going to continue to to go up forever
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
and we are the finance committee and I
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
vote representative walner walner cells
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
anything else to add no representative
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
cim BRS yes thank you Mr chair yeah um
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
if it's true what you said uh
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative Grassley that uh they
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
don't need to be lawyers and they're
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
going to get that kind of a
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
salary that that I would just assume not
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
hire any magistrates and up the amount
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
of money we're paying the bail
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and hire more of them so
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
if that were the case but uh as it is I
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
would I would stick to the five
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
magistrates I believe that that's fair
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
and it gets us started in the right path
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
as for all the reasons everybody has
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
stated and I also think that given the
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh current uh level of un unemployment
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
which is very low I I I think you will
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
find it difficult to fill even those
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
five representative
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
wer it's also a matter of how how much
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
assignment each one's going to have and
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
before we should talk about counties and
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
so on we should look at how many arrests
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
and try to drive figure out how many
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
arrests and divide these things that
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
they're their areas by the number of
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
arrests within a given area and that's
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
why when we came up with five it was
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
kind kind of like an executive Council
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
District so at least we know those areas
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
were evenly divided by population and
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
possibly by crimes committed so it it
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
would look at it would seem like a way
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
to to look at where the where the people
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
should be situated thank
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
you representative eil thank you very
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair I oppose the cut to five
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
last time and I continue to oppose it I
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
mean whether it's 10 or 11 um I again
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
have deep respect for the analysis that
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
was done over hours and days in weeks of
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
time by the policy committee and all the
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders they came up with 15 I
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
recognize if you're going to cut you
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
have to cut somewhat so I could go with
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
10 I think we are potentially setting
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
them up for failure by understaffing the
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
program I think if you bring in the
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
magistrates they could be through
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
a a training program together we can't
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
forget that bail Commissioners are not
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to weigh in on these 14
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
crimes that are set out in the in the
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
bill and um I think it's well worth the
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
money in my in my view so I'm going to
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
stick with my um vote to oppose the five
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
much seeing no no further questions we
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
do have a motion on the floor to
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
reconsider our action of last
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
week that reduce the number of uh
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
magistrates from 15 to
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
5 and when the clerk is ready we'll call
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
place I I I seconded so we could have
 
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.630 align:start position:0%
place I I I seconded so we could have
the

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:23.589 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
um well the the motion is basically to
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
rec consider the vote on um whether or
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
not um should change the bill as adopted
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.109 align:start position:0%
 
five

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:46.069 align:start position:0%
five
um

00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:51.710 align:start position:0%
um
Representative

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.589 align:start position:0%
no
noes

00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
noes
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
yes so now that we've moved by the
 
00:36:24.319 --> 00:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
yes so now that we've moved by the
number

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
of five would you like to explain
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
anything more representative Maguire on
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
your amendment I was going through
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
making the comparisons that from the
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
last Amendment which was mine to draw
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
everybody in and didn't see any
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
significant changes other than you
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
brought the bail commissioner fee up to
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
60 from 50 right so maybe this would be
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
the best time to talk about um the 750
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
and the 9 yes the the monitoring stuff
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
um commissioner I guess uh you're ready
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
would like no no no I I meant the ankle
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
bracelets oh okay I thought you were
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about the we we could do
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
so we could get the commissioner I get
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner out of here good okay
 
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:14.330 align:start position:0%
so this is about um the bail
 
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.670 align:start position:0%
so this is about um the bail
[Music]

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
um bail information system right so it's
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very small section I
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
think where is the money is on page
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
nine nine okay line well I'm sorry I'm
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.589 align:start position:0%
 
mine

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
mine
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
yes right so it's a the top of page
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
nine so this was not drafted the way I
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
would like it to be
 
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.390 align:start position:0%
would like it to be
so

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so but I think he didn't do it
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
because we haven't taken a vote yet so
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
so maybe I'll make it like a motion
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yeah we do have a
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
separate Amendment oh you have a
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
separate amendment to once we get this
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
could you hand that out now yes yeah why
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't we
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:19.780 align:start position:0%
right right so currently there's
 
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.950 align:start position:0%
right right so currently there's
[Music]

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
um uh 1 uh 736
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
million dollar here
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
allocated to
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
um uh some to the Department of Safety
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
some to the judicial branch to to do
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
this um bail information system a
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and so my proposal is to um
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
take it do have uh the department of
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
information Tech
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
technology um uh create such a system
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
and um allocate
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
$200,000 to um to go out and get a
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
vendor to to create it um anyways
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
so is that possible impossible what do
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
you think so commissioner if you could
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
identify yourself for the record and
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
those watching thanks sure good
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair uh members of the
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh Dennis G the um
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:30.990 align:start position:0%

Technology um so um I've I did a lot of
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about this over the weekend um
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
as well as communicating with the folks
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
that had you know done the the diligence
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
around the fiscal notes that or the
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal requirements that had been been
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
previously identified both by um the uh
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
court system as well as Department of
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
Safety um so what was is being proposed
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
in in in the original ask
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
was implementing functionality that's
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
inside the existing business processes
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
in the courts as well as in Departments
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
of safety and the entities in the
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
subdivi political subdivisions as well
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the and rep representative
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
Maguire was nice enough to send me kind
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
of an idea of what he was thinking of in
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
some level of detail so that I could
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
think about that as well those are two
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
very different
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
things um the what's conceived in the in
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment is a standalone system
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's not integrated to anything that
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
is a a separate business process um that
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be implemented uh separate and
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
additional business process that would
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
be implemented inside of a what I'm
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and understand as a very busy
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
system um would not be integrated under
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
the current constraints would not be
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
integrated to anything else
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
and and so you know my experience in
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing is when you you
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
always want to consider business process
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
first and then technology second and and
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
so um you know the the way the original
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
proposal was written it did consider the
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
existing business process um and making
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we were capturing information
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
inside the existing business processes
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
and and also um developing um the you
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
know the ability to query real time for
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officials as well as um
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
reporting um so I would say it's really
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
two different things um there's a
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
perception uh which you know I don't
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
again I don't know the business of of
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
the the court system um the uh judicial
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
branch but um they feel like it's just
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
not going to if we did something like
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
this the data just wouldn't get entered
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be an afterthought always and it
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't get entered and you know I
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
would tend to agree with that although
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
again I don't you know I couldn't say
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm an expert on that business process
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
um if we were to do it this way as a
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
standalone date system I'm not sure
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
maybe I could do it for 200 I'm not sure
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
I you know I nothing cost 200 anymore
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know especially if I'm getting a
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
vendor involved the uh the inflation in
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
the tech sector has been well ahead of
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
the what we claim it is in the in the in
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
the consumer sector but um but you know
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
in in general when cons receiving of a
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
standalone database that somebody would
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
be entering and querying on it's not a
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
complex um system and I would you know
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
the one difference one major difference
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
if you were considering a standalone
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
system versus a comprehensive integrated
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
system is that this is criminal justice
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
information it needs to be uh sieges
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
compliant and we would need to make sure
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
our hosting venue which is tends to be
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
more expensive than a regular hosting
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
venue and we'd want to make sure that
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
anybody that was working on it um you
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
know could um pass the appropriate
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
background checks as part of the
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
procurement process I think I would
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
really have to go and do some homework
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
myself I'm a little dubious that 200,000
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
would be enough but I don't know I don't
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
you know more importantly I don't think
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
this approach is going to would work
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
very well for supporting your your legis
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know the legislative intent of this
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill um additionally um I don't don't
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
have any Authority or um for systems in
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch so you know
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's having money appropriated to me
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
to do stuff on behalf of that you know a
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
big chunk of this would be a system that
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
would be working in that Branch so if
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
again if it was a standalone database
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
maybe it the money would be better
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
appropriated in in a um in the judicial
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
branch so so um that's my you know
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I came up with as I was
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
cogitating and losing a little sleep
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
over this over the weekend so happy to
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh committee may
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
have are there any questions for
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner gou represent Maguire thank
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for coming so
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
you said you you're not that familiar
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
with the processes of the I guess since
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
you don't do your department doesn't do
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
judicial related things right so so you
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't you can't probably answer whether
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
police officers currently have access to
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
any Judiciary Branch databases and so on
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
right that so this um to the extent that
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
I needed to be able to talk about this I
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
have an understanding because I asked
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
the questions but but so the spot system
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that was described in the there I
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
saw a letter that was sent I believe
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
some time ago to the a senate committee
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
on this that was prepared by the
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety so what they're
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
talking about so the two pieces of this
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
there's the the safety piece is the spot
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
system which is that system that they
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
make available to for law enforcement
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
officials to inquire about things and so
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
the monies that they had asked for would
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
make the bail information the new bail
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
information we're collecting and
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining available in real time
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
system okay further so so those that
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
system is used by bail
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um the I I believe the
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
system that's used by bail Commissioners
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
is the system that's over on the uh
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
judicial side which is their Odyssey
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
system right now do those two systems
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
talk to each other or yes okay they talk
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
to each other today I see all right
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
which is one of the you so it's one of
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
the reasons why you know this this idea
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
of a standalone system is it's taking a
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
considerable step back from what they
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
are you know the existing business
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
processes there's already data
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
Integrations and you know I I sit in the
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
middle of that sometimes because if
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes it you know people may people
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
on the court side May perceive it as a
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
doit problem and you know the folks over
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
in safety May perceive it as a course
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
problem so sometimes we're figuring out
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
whose problem it is but but generally
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
speaking the system's reliable I I
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
seldom hear about problems and and you
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
know we have been incrementally
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
enhancing it for the entire almost nine
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
years I've been here okay let me ask one
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
more if you don't mind so you said that
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
um the system wouldn't NE necessarily
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
get used right and I I don't quite
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
understand that because um because that
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
would be using it would be a requirement
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
of the work that that employees do right
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
I mean office dispatchers would have to
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
when someone you know when Joe Smith is
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
stopped would have to consult the system
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
to know if Joe Smith is out on bail um
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners when they bail
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
someone that would have would be
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
required to enter it into the system and
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
so on right so so why do you say it
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.549 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
used

00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
um what I heard from the folks in the
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is that since it's a
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
separate system that they would have to
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
use in addition to the system they're
 
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079 align:start position:0%
already using and that since it won't be
 
00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:18.030 align:start position:0%
already using and that since it won't be
you

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
know integrated into their systems that
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're currently
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
using adoption would be much more
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
difficult and and they're feeling like
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
it may be an afterthought a lot of times
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not in stream of the
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
process representative
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
grassy from what I understand from what
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
you said and being familiar with with
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
software systems in particularly ones
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
that don't talk to each other when they
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
when you want them to talk to each other
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
this has been a problem HHS has had for
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
years sometimes when people are put into
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
the system and people don't have access
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
I see a problem here and if am I
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
incorrect I mean if somebody is going
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
into this system that is being proposed
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
here for 200 $1,000 a standalone system
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
and somebody is working on the sponsor
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
they have to make they would have to
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
make sure to check both systems before
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
they could actually make an informed
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
decision on a case or someone that was
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
coming before
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
them I I I think that's correct um but I
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the the business process
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
for how a standal load system would get
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
implemented would have to be worked out
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that's probably true they'd
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
have to be using both systems and um so
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
in particular particular um for for you
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
know we like to use this term a single
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
paint of glass and generally you want to
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
have all the information in front of an
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
individual whether it's a law
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement you know or or a bail
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner or a judge all at the same
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
time so what you're looking at here is
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
the system that you're proposing or that
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're looking at funding here I don't
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
know if it's you're not proposing it but
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
the system that's being proposed is a
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
system that would integrate with the
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
spot system or whatever whatever
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
someone's using their desk it would be a
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
single system whether it be the spot
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
system or or the bail system whatever
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
and they would get the information so
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
you have spots on the department of
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
safety side you have Odyssey on the on
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
the um and this would be a third be
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
integrated with all that it would
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
leverage the existing
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
integration so the so the data would be
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
available on both sides thank
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
you in real time are there further
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner so just so I have this
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
straight the amendment that we have in
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
front of us is looking for a sum of
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
$200,000 to develop a system that will
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
work to get make all these things come
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
together are you saying that that's not
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
enough I don't know I I'd have to do
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
some work on that but um to build a
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
standalone system and maintain it what
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
what the 200 doesn't comp uh uh have is
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
any ongoing um requirements to keep it
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
running and supported so it's a you
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
might be able to build it supporting it
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
there's no money there to to do that and
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
again um you know you have you have
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs that that would be
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
required the the maintenance cost and
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
and uh for the for the system is
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
included in the original pricing by
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
safety and and the judicial branch as
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
well so I have one further question for
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
you the
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
$750,000 for the Department of Safety is
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
that a number they got from you as far
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
as they they worked with uh so the folks
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
on the business side in safety who run
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
spots worked with members of my team who
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
are embedded in Department of Safety to
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
generate that number and the vendor who
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
presently supports
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
it and that would require a contract
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
going out to bid through the GNC right
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh that would probably be a soul Source
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment with the incumbent because
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's going into the system we're
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
running today it wouldn't be yet another
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
system as as would be the case in the
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch on the Odyssey system
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't it wouldn't be yet another
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
you know you Pro you potentially could
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
do another system but then you're
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
integrating you're creating two new
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
Integrations as well as the integration
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
that we have today which again is there
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
there's some technical comp there's
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
technical complexity every time you do
 
00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
technical complexity every time you do
an

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
integration so the
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
9986000 for the judicial branch you had
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
no involvement with that whatsoever no I
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
didn't uh but when I when when I asked
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
the folks over there they had they had
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
um requested a quote I believe from
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
Tyler I think it's Tyler Technologies
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
who owns that the vendor of record and
 
00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:35.799 align:start position:0%
so they requested a quote from them on
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's develop developing
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
the additional
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
functionality inside the um existing app
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
and supporting it for I think two years
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
or something like that represent McGuire
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
I think you had a question yes so if we
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
spend this 1.7 36 million what is the
 
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.190 align:start position:0%
spend this 1.7 36 million what is the
ongoing

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
um maintenance cost annually
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
afterward I don't know the answer to
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
that but it I know that they I believe
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
each one of them built I can get that
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
information for the committee and follow
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
up quickly I'll get that from the folks
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
on both sides would you guess it's
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands or no um it's
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
probably going to be
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
within a small increment from what we're
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
already paying for maintenance of the
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
existing systems I don't think it's a a
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
huge left thank you all right Mr
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll I'll save time and
 
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
withdraw this
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
amendment all right Amendment 1179 is
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you very much you're very
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
always so represent McGuire would you
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
like to continue with yes so so I think
 
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
the only other big thing in here is the
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
ankle bracelet aspect of it
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hof I mean the rest of this is strictly
 
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.390 align:start position:0%
Hof I mean the rest of this is strictly
copied

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
copied
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
from there are some changes I I have my
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
notes from when we submitted uh the I
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
trying to go through in the original
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that was offered to combine
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
and trying to line these things up and
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
because they don't line up it looked
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
like there were additional changes but
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
it's kind of difficult but I can go
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
through what we've submitted and I've
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
been checking to make sure that was
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
included yeah thanks yeah if you could
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
do that Mike that'd be great in
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1204 which was the lean
 
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
two the amendment would eliminate
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
paragraphs one and two because um they
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
would kind of be replaced with the
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
training Provisions that you've already
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment and on page seven
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
which is the page with a lot of
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
bold it talks about the different kinds
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
of felony level offenses there's a
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
there and the term substantial evidence
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
was used on line
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:59.710 align:start position:0%
 
down

00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
15

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes that that standard of yes
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence is replaced with
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence yes so um
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's a good point may I speak to this
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
um one of these bills created a new
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
throughout existing law in this area
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
there's what's called clear and
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence um for um for these
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
decisions and and so one of these bills
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
added a new category called um
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence which is supposed
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be somewhere it's defined as being in
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
between um clear and convincing not not
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
as strong as clear and convincing but
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
not as weak as what was the other word
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
um preponderance preponderance of the
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
evidence or something like that and so I
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
spoke to um representative Lynn about
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
this detail and he recommended that we
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
do not create a new standard of evidence
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
because number one it's brand new it
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anywhere else in law and
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
and so therefore there would have to be
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
training involved you know
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
considerable lots of different people
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
would have to try to learn what do you
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
mean by this and so on whereas today
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what clear and
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
convincing means they know what propound
 
00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
of the evidence means and so on and so
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
he did not think that that there was any
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
benefit to doing that so we we took it
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
out um because
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's there would be costs involved and
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
and it and it was sort of an
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
inconsistency from one bill that dealt
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
with bail to another one so so we left
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
believe representative eil our
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
lawyer so uh basically this bill went
 
00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:15.039 align:start position:0%
through the whole policy committee they
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
came up with this bill when you start
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
when you start dealing with standards of
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that is like policy in neon
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
lights and while I
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
respect representative Lynn a
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
conversation for him with him I don't
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
see how a finance committee can justify
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
changing the standard of evidence that's
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
used in these
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
cases in what we're doing I mean that's
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
a big
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
change and I it to me is scary
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
grassy Mike all I said is we don't want
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
that representative sede have anything
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
to add here representative
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
wner all right well again I think this
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
was an issue that was was inconsistent
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
from one bill to the next right that's
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
why we have to make a decision
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
right I don't recall excuse me I don't
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
recall this particular thing substantial
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
evidence as being a problem that this is
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
radar I if somebody else had an issue
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
me again
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
I think we need to be awful cautious
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
when we uh start moving into the policy
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
line of things chairman Roy's committee
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
did a lot of work on this months and
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
months and many meetings many public
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
hearings and I don't know why they use
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence but I bet there was
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
probably a good reason
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
why I yes sir if you could make it quick
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a uh my name is buz Sher I'm a
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
police commissioner in Portsmouth and uh
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
professor at the at UNH law school um
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
this issue of the substantial evidence
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
was really carefully negotiated over
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
several weeks during our process
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh and it it the change from clear and
 
01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
convincing to substantial evidence was a
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
a very conscious one to deal with some
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the concerns from Prosecutor's
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
um easy for me to say
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
but it concerns me when we start pulling
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
policy threads because this this is a
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan and you know in ways
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh I know him as Justice Lynn as Justice
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
Lynn doesn't know because he did not
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
appear in front of the committee uh this
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
makes a mess of things uh and you know
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
right now this bill has to support of
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
the police Chiefs Association the ACLU
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh the prosecutors
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
Association a broad spectrum of uh
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
people across the political boundar it
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
really is the you can call it
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan or you can call it
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
bipartisan but the extent we start
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
pulling threads it unravels a lengthy
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
negotiation for this so I it it was very
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
conscious and we really uh it really
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
needs to stay representative wer please
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Professor can you give an
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
example like whether or not to bail
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
someone to see whether there is a risk
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
to safety of them eles or the
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
community what would be the difference
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
in that instance between substantial
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
um sometimes you get in when you're
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
trying to decide whether there's clear
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence of
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
dangerousness uh you get a piece of the
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
evidence or maybe all of the evidence is
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
ambiguous one people would interpret it
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
as clear as as dangerous clearly and
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
convincingly and other people wouldn't
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh by by lowering a
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
notch um it tries to help baill
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners pay attention to who is
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
dangerous and that was uh better
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
attention uh to who is dangerous uh and
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
um it you know to be honest with you I
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't in support of it because you know
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but I I fully support it as a part of
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
this whole package what kind of criteria
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
are you looking at in this instance to
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
say well this is clear he's not
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous or this is clear he is
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous or well the the the the the
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
person making that decision be it a bail
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner ideally a magistrate to or
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
a uh a judge uh they can look at
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
whatever is put in front of them by the
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
prosecution and it can be uh it can be
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
evidence of verbal threats you know
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in like a domestic violence
 
01:02:59.309 --> 01:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
circumstance it could be evidence of
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
verbal threats it can be a sequence of
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
uh violent crime convictions over the
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
years uh it can be the nature of the
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
particular crime that uh the person is
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
charged with uh it it it was intended
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
the original bail Reform Act which
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
included this clear and convincing
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
standard which which I authored for
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
Senator felt then Senator felus uh it
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
was intended to give the the judges as
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
much leeway as possible um to make sure
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
that people who were dangerous we're not
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
getting out on pale than representative
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman so if we
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
add um this new standard of evidence is
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
it likely that that action alone will
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
generate a lot of court cases and
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
judicial decisions and so on since this
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
is a brand new standard of evidence
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
won't there be court cases that say does
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
this apply does this not apply and so on
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
I mean are we making a lot more work no
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
for the Judiciary no no there will be
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
there'll be one case that uh makes its
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
way through the system up to the New
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court where they they
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
clarify if needed what it means uh one
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
of the reasons the you know it it would
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
have been a mistake just to put that new
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
new standard in there without
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
identifying that it's more than a
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence you know
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
5149 and it's less than clear and
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
convincing uh we put a definition in
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
be there'll be a period where one case
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
will get through the system uh but um I
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
think uh prosecutors and courts and
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers will sort this out
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly it's not it's not there's
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
not going to be any uh any significant
 
01:04:58.599 --> 01:04:59.630 align:start position:0%
not going to be any uh any significant
added

01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
added
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
cost it's just part it will be part of
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
the judicial process of clarifying new
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
language all right thank you very much
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
can I ask one one more um are you aware
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
of any other states that use this um
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
language um I'm not aware of any other
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
states using this language uh in in
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
terms of bail I'm aware of other states
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
using clar convincing and I'm aware of
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
other states using a preponderance of
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
the evidence so uh yeah it was a it was
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
a new creation to satisfy a desire to
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
give judges a little more we leeway when
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with cases where there was
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
ambiguous evidence as to clear and
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
convincing and you know I will be
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
completely honest with you
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I was not in
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
favor of this I was in favor of clear
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
and convincing but you know a Deal's a
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
deal and this was a part of a whole
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
package that um um all right I don't I
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't mind conceding this particular
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
point it's fine we can we can talk to
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
the senate about it and so on okay so
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
Mike can you figure out where that would
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
go to make this change yeah we would put
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.559 --> 01:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll go back to the my amendment I
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
one all right so it would go yeah other
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
eight on line starting on line
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
26 there a sentence that said if a
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
person's case terminates without a
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
conviction for any offense the person
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
shall not be liable to pay the cost of
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
removed I'm sorry Mike I you repeat that
 
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's on page eight y starting on line 26
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
26 says if a person's case terminates
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
without a conviction for any
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
offense the person shall not be liable
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
to pay the cost cost of electronic
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
monitoring right this was the point that
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
the counties objected to I believe right
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
that that um yeah you were supposed to
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
get together with the counties on yes
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did so so this is
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
um this does not refund um electronic
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
monitoring costs in the in the effect
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
that in the case where someone is later
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
found not to be guilty right so similar
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
to other fees and other things that
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
people pay when they're when they're
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
accused uh you know the bail
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner fee for one and other
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
things so so that's this because they
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
thought that the just the keeping track
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
of it and and being you know refunding
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
money is very difficult so that was the
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
point all right we all are we all good
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
with that
okay

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.669 align:start position:0%
okay
next

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
Mike you know it's really too bad I know
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot of work but that OS
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
us yeah the the other major difference
 
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
if I might the the other major
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
difference in the monitoring area is
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
that the bills created it as a Judiciary
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
function and we've come to learn that
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
this is really more of a count County
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
function and so that's
 
01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.030 align:start position:0%
function and so that's
why

01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's how this has been
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
um and in particular one of one of
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy's points was that he wanted
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
the the magistrates to do this
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring and yet I've heard that it's
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
really sort of in appropriate
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
for uh judici Judiciary employees who
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
are you know giving out Justice to be
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
involved in the you know day-to-day kind
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
of kind of um uh monitoring of people on
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
bail and and that sort of thing it's
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
that's really more of a of a county or
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement activity and so that's
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
why this is that was another sort of
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
substantial change here
 
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.669 align:start position:0%
substantial change here
here

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to need clarification on
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
that um because we had language to have
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
the counties operate their monitoring
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
programs um and I was unclear we got
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
some cost information and we kind of
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
extrapolated across the whole state now
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
was unclear if we were going to abandon
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
that effort and go back to the original
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill or how the language to um support
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
worded um yeah so so I think you're I
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
would like we would like the counties to
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
do it I think so that means page8 lines
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
changed because this still has it done
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:57.790 align:start position:0%
by the
courts

01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
so representative Maguire based on my
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
notes you were going to get together
 
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
with the county and or count the
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative I see from the counties
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
is here are you in agreement with some
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
of these proposed changes not to put you
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:20.070 align:start position:0%
on the
spot

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
well okay yeah I asked for County
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
again I'll just remind the division we
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
really need to come with a conclusion
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
today although the chair of the full
 
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee gave us until 11:30 to fill in
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
any holes tomorrow but hopefully we can
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
get things done because Mike and Melissa
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
have to kind of button things up for
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning a representative evil
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
does the judicial branch have any view
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
change

01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am Aon krian general
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
councel for the judicial branch yes we
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
do uh we do not have any capability when
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
it comes to electronic monitoring we we
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
simply don't have a pre-trial division
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the courts in New Hampshire as other
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
states do um this would be rebuilding
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
with us some of the capabilities that
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
the county already has um so it it does
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
make sense to us to transfer the
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
us

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hoffman I'm not sure uh how many
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
counties are
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
actually actually have electronic
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
now or right so one of the big questions
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
in this area and it's just a difficulty
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
is whether or not the two smallest
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
counties or the three smallest counties
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be required to have this kind
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
of monitoring or not right and so um
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
because they're considerably smaller
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're very small by by
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
comparison so
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
um it appears that all that there are
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
very little or no fixed costs so what I
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
was concerned about is um coas County
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
and Sullivan County and to some extent
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
Carol County are are
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
about you know an eighth or a tenth of
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
the size of Hillsboro County right and
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
so and so if there's a fixed cost to
 
01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.189 align:start position:0%
so and so if there's a fixed cost to
electronic

01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring and it's a Per County kind of
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
fixed cost then it's it's ridiculous to
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
to impose that up on coas County for
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
example but um it appears from what I
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
can understand is that essentially all
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the costs are variable it's it's so
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
much per Monitor and and you know that's
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's a weekly rental type of thing um
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that's true then it is okay to
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
to you know impose this on All Counties
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
but I was considering at some point you
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
know putting in some kind of provision
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
you know all counties with greater than
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
50,000 residents or something like that
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
so that the really tiny counties would
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
be would be excluded um I you know I
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
could go either way with that
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
um anything else Mike and the changes
 
01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.590 align:start position:0%
um anything else Mike and the changes
within

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
this represent a graph scene I I you
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
know I think that maybe something in
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
here because I know the state does
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
monitoring it through the state prison
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
and with people who are put out on bail
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
and I know that you know there are
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
counties that do this and maybe a
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
provision put in here that if County
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
isn't going to do it themselves that
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
they contract with somebody and that
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
could either be the state or another
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
sure on the page 11 of Representative
 
01:15:20.639 --> 01:15:21.990 align:start position:0%
sure on the page 11 of Representative
Maguire's

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire's
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment section starts with judicial
 
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.350 align:start position:0%
Amendment section starts with judicial
training

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
that language is the same as the
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that you adopted
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
earlier that was the house the 105
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
for educational requirements for bail
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners on page
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
12 that now will read the judicial
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
training coordinator instead of the
 
01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
training coordinator instead of the
chief

01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
magistrate in the section on the bottom
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
page for
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
funding there are three Appropriations
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
one for five new M
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates one for uh the electronic
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring program within the branch
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
that of course will change depending on
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
the decision whether or not the counties
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
will operate
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
that um and those
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
paragraphs shall not
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
elapse and then we have the effective
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
end so as far as the the monitoring goes
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
I think the language we had I had
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
discussed with the county was counties
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
were that um they could
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
charge um the uh the accused for the
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
monitoring and so therefore an
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation wasn't necessary again
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
because there doesn't seem to be any
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
fixed costs here it seems to be enely
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
variable and that seems to be in the
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
four counties that are that have this
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
feature this function that's what they
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
do so it it for them it wouldn't change
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the other six it would be just
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
adding this a similar program to what
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
have representative Maguire you had an
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
earlier Amendment with a paragraph that
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
kind of spelled that out that each
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
County shall operate a monitoring
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
program and recover the costs through um
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
charge I can take that
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph through a reasonable charge or
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
or something like that yes right and
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
where does that Amendment stand that was
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh presented last week I don't think
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
copies

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
representative Roy had nothing to do no
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
AR no no arguments
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
here those in favor so Mike are we
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
putting an impossible task on you to try
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.719 --> 01:19:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
so the issues with the Maguire Amendment
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
or not maybe issues is in the correct
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
word but that's
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
1204 I'm sorry that was my Amendment
 
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.470 align:start position:0%
1204 I'm sorry that was my Amendment
the

01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
1382 we should still talk the60 yeah I
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
was going to mention that though one of
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
the things I do support because I had a
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
standalone Amendment for bringing the
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner's fee up to 60 which
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
was in line with the Senate that
 
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire included in his
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
saw did you did yeah you
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
um I circled it wherever that was and I
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
was scanning through here Mr chair just
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear they're being paid 50 for
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
training and 60 for the work that are
 
01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
you guys distinguishing okay yeah on
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
page nine of the Maguire Amendment uh
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
line 12 entitled to a fee of 60 versus
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
40 what they're getting now so you did
 
01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.189 align:start position:0%
40 what they're getting now so you did
add

01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
add
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
it okay or he did someone did maybe we
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
should talk and have a vote on that
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
one what do you think well you don't
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
like the 60
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
now yeah I'm
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm sort somewhat reluctant
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right here's the
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
thing not only are we going 40 to 50 is
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
is a 25% increase okay 40 to 60 is a 50%
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
increase but not only are we doing that
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're guaranteeing that the money
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
will be paid the big problem with pay
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
these days is that some in some
 
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
districts they're only getting half the
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
pay that they're entitled to right so
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's another 50% increase for
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
some and for others it's not
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't know these are just
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
difficult numbers to no matter what the
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
number is it's probably too small for
 
01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
the work I mean people aren't people
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
aren't doing this don't get rich to to
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
to make a living right I mean this is a
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
this is a stipend of some kind it's not
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
a you know it's it's primarily a
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer job right so I don't know I I
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
I personally if I had to pick a number I
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
would pick 50 um that is the house
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
position if you you know to for those of
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
you who think the house position is
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
sacn um and you know or you know I don't
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
know it's it's just a matter of judgment
 
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.390 align:start position:0%
know it's it's just a matter of judgment
I

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
guess thank you Mr Joe who put forth
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
that amendment that stand yes stand yeah
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
I yeah I had put it forward a week or
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
two ago well thank you I uh I agree with
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
thanks we probably ought to vote on the
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Maguire
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
put forward now there was an
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that we are not going to
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
take the language
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
or clear and convincing we're going to
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
go back to the original language there's
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
a 60
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
fee is in five magistrates are those are
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
major issues Mr Hoffman that this
 
01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:34.510 align:start position:0%
major issues Mr Hoffman that this
amendment

01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
changed yes and uh then the outstanding
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
issue would be the um County County uh
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
operation of electronic Monitor and
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
yep if you could please come to the mic
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
thanks and again your name name and
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
representing the
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
counties thank you Mr chair Kate hgan
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association of
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
counties I would just ask if you are
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
going to leave the electronic monitoring
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
with the counties you make the effective
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
date July 1st 2025 because we'll have to
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
go through budgeting processes and not
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
all counties are on a fiscal year some
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
are on a calendar year so I would want
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
to give them the opportunity because it
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
will require a contract um to get that
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
done before piece becomes effective if
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
shall and again that date again was July
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 because that'll give everybody
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
who's on a fiscal year enough time and
 
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
everyone who's on a calendar year all
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
set with that Mr
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
you yeah how about show a hands on 50
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
versus 6 yeah welcome to to do that
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is moving that we
 
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
stay at 50 versus 60 for the bail
 
01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner fee and I'll second it for
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and there's been enough
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor of uh
 
01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
keeping it at 50 versus
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
60 two and bringing it to
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
and it's probably 20
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
years it's been a long time since I was
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner and that's what we
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
got uh 20 20 years ago so I had a bill
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
early earlier this year to raise the fee
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the Bureau of tax and land appeals
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
which hasn't changed in 40 years and the
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee rejected it as being too high
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
knows

01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've got that little piece
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
taken care of so what we have before us
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
now is amendment
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
1382 uh which was offered by
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I think we the
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
big issue perhaps it's a stale made on
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
support perhaps would be the five
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
magistrates versus 10 but I think we're
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
probably uh Griffin I
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
believe you seconded the or I seconded
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
for discussion for the $50 $60 for okay
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
but we're going to move on 138 if
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
there's a motion to move the Maguire
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
amendments with the understanding that
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
we've done some
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
modification and Mr hoffen will have
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
that for us tomorrow morning I hope and
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's moved by representative Maguire I
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
believe so you don't want to come back
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
at 11: and do that well we'll we'll have
 
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
a motion so he can move forward with it
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah and it's seconded by
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
clear well I as much as I'd like to
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
support um the Maguire Amendment I think
 
01:26:26.189 --> 01:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
we've made some good progress as I have
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
a real hard time with the five for
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
magistrates if it was 10 I spent uh
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
several long phone conversations with
 
01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
the chair Roy over the weekend we've
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
communicated uh through text messaging
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
and I respect the work that they have
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
done uh and when the chair tells me that
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
it unravels the plan it concerns me that
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
and I think he was willing to go down to
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
10 which I think was a sacrifice I know
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
it was for him but
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
U for that reason I can't support the
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is proposed with that one
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
issue as far as the number of
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
magistrates seeing no further questions
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh or comments if the clerk would please
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
role um representative Maguire yes
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny yes representative
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
cambrell yes represent chair Wier yes
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
clerk votes no Representative walner no
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative grass no represent chair
 
01:27:33.239 --> 01:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
representative grass no represent chair
lean

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
no and again I want to make it very
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
clear I think there's a lot of support
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
for the work was done it's just an issue
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
on the magistrates is I think our
 
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.550 align:start position:0%
on the magistrates is I think our
biggest

01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
concern Mr chair I have that Amendment
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
with the paragraph in the county
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
language from last week all right yeah
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
we'll hand it out if this take a quick
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
concerns do you have any more cannabis
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
amendments or are we all
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
better this will end up being
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
three House Bill
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
318 representative Maguire would you
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
like to describe your proposed changes
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I think all the beginning
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
stuff is is not uh it looks similar is
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
so so this is the same language that you
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
looked at last week um prior to your
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
conversation right with Kate Horgan so I
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
provided a copy to Kate as
 
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.590 align:start position:0%
provided a copy to Kate as
well

01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
um it's at line 22 is where County comes
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
in right so it's essentially the same
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
thing as was Judiciary except it now
 
01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
says County right and
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
um the Indigent part is like I said
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
slightly changed uh line nine on page
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
two because the original Bill said if
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
someone was later found found innocent
 
01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
they would get a re they would get a
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
refund and we we took that out this
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
allow and this allows them to to U
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
contract with a state agency or
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
government entity to provide it so they
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
could contract with another County to
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.970 align:start position:0%
provide that
service

01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:09.980 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:12.870 align:start position:0%
service
[Music]

01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
um yes line 24 right right line 24 y yes
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
right it's either or yes so exactly what
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
we what I said earlier yeah
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
anybody have a problem with uh
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
1251 just
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
to and this would be amendment to 318
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
now yes make 318 the vehicle
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
yep okay we'll just have a show of hands
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
move all right sh Miss Mike so good
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
thanks all right seeing that we've
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
gotten through uh
 
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
10005 318 252 will back go back up to
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
1589 I believe representa Maguire has an
 
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:18.310 align:start position:0%
1589 I believe representa Maguire has an
amendment

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
yes yeah those will be am is about
 
01:31:23.119 --> 01:31:27.030 align:start position:0%
yes yeah those will be am is about
certain

01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
Poston

01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
position where's
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
accept are we okay representa Maguire
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
right yeah so this one
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
um so the main thing is we we discovered
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
that um the numbers we got from this was
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
that was that there was going to be like
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
27 cases a year and we decided and but
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
the but the National Guard was
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
recommending that we increase that to
 
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
40 um we decided to make this a uh
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a case type of thing rather than
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
because if you remember the original
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
bill it was A2 million doll a
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
year um just pay Straight payments to
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
counties and and so that seemed like way
 
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
Overkill so what this does is it changes
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
it to $5,000 a
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
case um and after any federal funds that
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
microphones thank you do we still
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
require how many places there has to be
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
a court or do we just kind of leave it
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
up to what the demand
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so you've you've gotten rid of the uh
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
large counties the medium counties and
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the small
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
counties right all that stuff so it's
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
strictly going to be at the end of the
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
year the county will send a bill and the
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
bill will say you know we had 10 cases
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
this year and so they'll get a $50,000
 
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.430 align:start position:0%
this year and so they'll get a $50,000
check

01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's what it is um and
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
I think we put in a I put in a maximum
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
that I can uh walk through the changes
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
on this one if you'd
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
like I'm I'm sorry Mr Hoffman I can walk
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
thanks so it amends the bill by changing
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
it from a grant program to a reimburse
 
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.149 align:start position:0%
it from a grant program to a reimburse
ment

01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
ment
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
program provides that the
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
counties may receive an annual state
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
basis it as uh representative grassy
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned it takes out the
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
classification by size and the Caps
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the county so
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
everyone all the counties would be
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
eligible for $5,000 up to $5,000 per
 
01:34:53.199 --> 01:34:58.750 align:start position:0%
eligible for $5,000 up to $5,000 per
case

01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
um okay there there is a Max of $100,000
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
though which you know Li that's total
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
sum that's what we're appropriating is a
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
total sum so they wouldn't be able to
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
spend they wouldn't be able to receive
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
grants that's for hiring the coordinator
 
01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
so and that has that will change
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
actually the appropriation um should be
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
$163,000 I had it wrong I've asked for a
 
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
correction on that 63,000 will cover the
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
half a Year's cost of the veterans core
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
coordinator then after that onetime
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation there's language for the
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
branch to include the cost in there um
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
budget yeah so the maximum appropriation
 
01:35:45.679 --> 01:35:47.189 align:start position:0%
budget yeah so the maximum appropriation
like

01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
is the maximum would be in this $100,000
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
for half a year
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
so as as I had this drafted there's no
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
maximum of 200,000 I simply divided the
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
200,000 to make an appropriation of
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
100,000 in the first year for half a
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
year oh and then we'll we'll do it
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
whatever we want next time and it could
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
be more or less depending on how the
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay are there are there any questions
 
01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.109 align:start position:0%
okay are there are there any questions
rep

01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
rep
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
aable just following up on chair wier's
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
question is this enabling or it's
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
required per Court um I believe it's
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's enabling right is the way I read it
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
um there's going to be a program right
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
and then when and then this is like the
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
carrot right so if a county does it they
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
get the the $5,000 a case and it does
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
say the state that that courts May rece
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
rece an annual reimbursement per case
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
right it's an and you know the theory
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
behind this is it ends up saving people
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
money because like drug court they're
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
not in jail right so so they have they
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
do have fairly good incentive to do it
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
but the question was is it sort of again
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
for the smallest counties is it more
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
trouble than it's worth and that kind of
 
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.750 align:start position:0%
trouble than it's worth and that kind of
thing

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
so what would it be like to do with
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
1384 are there any more questions it's
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
being moved by representative Maguire
 
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.550 align:start position:0%
being moved by representative Maguire
seconded

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%

01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
Griffin all right um we okay with just a
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
show of hands on this doesn't seem too
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
controversial all ready to show of hands
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
of supporting the
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%

unanimous okay Mike something else get
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
to us for tomorrow and this amendment
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
number will change after I correct the
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation thank thank you we'll take
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
a short break and then we'll come back
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:13.830 align:start position:0%

last week and also uh representative
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
Leon's language that we discussed so Mr
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hoffman do you want
 
01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
to go through your
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
markup yes um what this does is it takes
 
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
the two amendments number 1356 from
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and your Amendment
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
1339 h combines them into one and it
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
also um on the penalty for public
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
use changes the misdemeanor to class b
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
instead of a um undesignated
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor which could be an A and
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
time the uh appropriation sections um I
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
asked them to use uh the leash Amendment
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
which is a charge against the liquor
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
fund there's one difference there's a
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
position in a small appropriation in the
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
lay on Amendment mment that I have not
 
01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
included in here
 
01:47:57.639 --> 01:47:59.790 align:start position:0%
included in here
um

01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
which might should have might have I
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
don't know but I just didn't know if the
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee was aware of the appropriation
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
and the additional position I can make
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
that change easily if you would like to
 
01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.109 align:start position:0%
that change easily if you would like to
include

01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
it any discussion on that including the
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
language for the additional support
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
person representative Grassi did I see
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
position position was on a classified
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
position to the Department of Health
 
01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.030 align:start position:0%
position to the Department of Health
Human

01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
Human
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
to to complete the responsibilities
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
relative to collecting analyzing
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
reporting of
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
data it was
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
2025 represent Maguire you have any
 
01:48:58.109 --> 01:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts isn't there
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
already I'm thinking
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
$500,000 for collecting data or maybe it
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
was just a hundred for collecting data
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
yeah the good representative from Deary
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
here um thank you Mr chairman um with my
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendments it moved the data collection
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
out of a department that does not do
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
that into Department of Health and Human
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
Services and they would need that
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
position in order to do the data
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
collection which captures Baseline so
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we can understand um from how
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
things look today and compare it with
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
the future um which is why there is that
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
position for the data there's the
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
$500,000 which is for the public
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
education campaign and that is actually
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
one that is um homeless if we remove the
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention and treatment
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund however an education
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
campaign in order to have fact-based not
 
01:49:56.669 --> 01:49:56.679 align:start position:0%
fear-based education about the risks of
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis is something that is very
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
crucial to the harm reduction effort um
 
01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.109 align:start position:0%
crucial to the harm reduction effort um
through

01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
legalization so that's something that um
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
the department could speak about how to
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
have the education campaign since we've
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
removed the substance use prevention
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery Fund um doing it
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
through that is a lot easier well it's a
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
little cleaner so that that money
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't get diverted to other use but
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
there may be flexible ways order to make
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
sure that we can start that public
 
01:50:25.159 --> 01:50:28.750 align:start position:0%
sure that we can start that public
education

01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
campaign yes represent McGuire thank you
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
so um Mike on page 21 line
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
18 so is is this the 100,000 in addition
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
to the position of 10 and something
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.639 --> 01:50:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
purpose

01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
are you looking in the bill as amended
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
by the house the the amendment you just
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
handed out Lehman 1381 H page
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
21 line
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
18 $100,000 for Department of HHS for
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of collecting Baseline data
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
so is that like that you said that they
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
we need we need a person there right so
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
is that just going to change the 100 to
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
105 or is it this is like I don't know
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
computer time that the person needs to
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
use or something you
 
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
know I'm gonna go back to the amendment
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
week no that's not the same
 
01:51:51.520 --> 01:52:01.470 align:start position:0%
week no that's not the same
appropriation

01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think page 20 of course should
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
go into the data collection and what
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.149 align:start position:0%
 
done

01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
yeah the $100,000 didn't change what
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
what I did not include was the position
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.270 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
Mike the other Mike would you like to
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you know a little more about this
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
because it looks like the $100,000 was
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for the record
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Holt I'm the
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
administrator of the theraputic cannabis
 
01:53:18.189 --> 01:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
program with the Department of Health
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.430 align:start position:0%
and Human
Services

01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:23.189 align:start position:0%
Services
um

01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced had a $100,000
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation given to the Department of
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
Safety to do data collection on Baseline
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
data and health outcome data um before
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
and after
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
legalization uh testimony in house
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
Commerce uh indicated that they do not
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
have the capacity for that um and uh so
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
HHS volunteered to take on that work the
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um uh through our fiscal note
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
we've indicated that we need
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
$109,000 so that is is supposed to be
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the difference the 109 replaces
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
the 100 and also um the I believe
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lan's Amendment or a
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
version somewhere in these piles you
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
know includes an authorization for us to
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
create a new position um a data analyst
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
position so for clarity the 100,000
 
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
should be 109 and there should be
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
additional language to create um the the
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
data systems analysis analyst
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:24.069 align:start position:0%
data systems analysis analyst
position

01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you will this person be doing
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
polling or something is that how how
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
would the where would the data come
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
from so the language um the the
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
requirement that establishes the
 
01:54:38.109 --> 01:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
language that
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
requires this work to be done requires
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
the department to enter into memorandums
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
of understanding with various agencies
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
house relevant data including Department
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
of Education um the commission
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
itself um Etc so the language is General
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and and it authorizes the department
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
to enter into with other agencies that
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
house that data to collect that data to
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
um report that data um out on a um fixed
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
schedule in the
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
law we do not have the capacity to do
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
this work with current staff we need an
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
additional position for this work to be
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
accomplished and the dollar amount for
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
that new position 9,000 9 that includes
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and yes
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay the pleasure of the division anyone
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire just said
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
sure okay and specifically for language
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
on my previous Amendment on the top of
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
page 19 um lines 1 through eight would
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
be the similar language in order to have
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
that position and the
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
Michael are there any other questions
 
01:56:02.109 --> 01:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
Le you have something else you'd like to
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
say uh yes and I apologize for keeping
 
01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
coming back for more and more and more
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
and more but I have two Financial
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
related issues that I think would give
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
some clarification based upon the fiscal
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
note and some of the discussion of the
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
costs um it was discussed about the need
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
for enforcement before any rules were
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
created and before this Market was
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
created um it sounded like that may be
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
involved in looking at home grow or
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
anything else that could be seen as
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
competition to the market which would be
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
the premise for it um it seems to me
 
01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
that it would be cleanest to leave any
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the controlled Drug Act
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
to those agencies that are already doing
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
that and by going to I I'll have to on
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
page seven line five in enforcement
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
Authority um if we would change that to
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
read the commission it already says the
 
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
commission shall have the primary
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility for enforcing this
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
chapter I would add the sentence
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement of chapter 318-b shall not
 
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
be included in the responsibilities of
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
the commission and then go to the local
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement cooperation that
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
would make it clear that they are not
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
expanding their scope into the larger
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
drug issues but they're simply involved
 
01:57:17.229 --> 01:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the Commerce that is involved
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
um it seems like that would be a good
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
way to keep cost in
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
line and you have that language you can
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
give to Mr Hoffman I do I even have it
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
highlighted that I could hand out to
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
everybody along with my other um small
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
comment which is around operational
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
that and you can ignore the other Pages
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
there were quite a few places where
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
things could have been cleaned up
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
clarified moved to the FW without going
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
past what is tolerable um but I know
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
that you've been working on so many
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
details today um I think that we should
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
just keep focused on the most necessary
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
changes here um the other is um a large
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
part of why I separated out statutorily
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
the operational control from the
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory control was around the
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
concern of building out expensive
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
systems that would not be able to Pivot
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
should we not be able to implement the
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
agency model or the franchise model
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
should the other body move to franchise
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
um everything I'm talking about is just
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
on the the first page I there is more
 
01:58:26.109 --> 01:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
that we could talk about if you had the
 
01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
interest but this is most important um
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
so this would in the r making Authority
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
Under operational control um state that
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
um approve s submit statutory language
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
and approve rules subject to the
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process pursuant to RSA 541a
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
for the franchising cannabis re uh for
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
the agency cannabis retail outlets which
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
keeps all operational control distinct
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
from regulatory control the that's
 
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
pretty important because there aren't
 
01:58:57.069 --> 01:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
any federal laws other than it's illegal
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh so if you're looking at having a
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory body regulate somebody that's
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
in a business operation with themselves
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
that gets to be a little complex the
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
operates some facilities and their a
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
regulatory body so there is some
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
precedence to keep that clear and
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
separate it's good practice but it's
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot easier in the
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process to make sure that
 
01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
operational control and Regulatory
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
control are separate if we were to
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
line and that would be on page 16 line
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
24 I apologize for not giving you where
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
it would slide in to um the amendment
 
01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
and that is what the most recent the the
 
01:59:36.199 --> 01:59:40.990 align:start position:0%
and that is what the most recent the the
updated

01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment so page 16 line you said
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
24

01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
so adding to the end of that sentence
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail outlets uh which keeps
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
all operational control distinct from
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:10.990 align:start position:0%
 
Authority

02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative wer I know you
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
support cannabis
 
02:00:19.069 --> 02:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
not any comments or
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%

02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
SE that

week well there's there's still time
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative grassy I think
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire would help you
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
any questions comments okay with the
 
02:01:09.639 --> 02:01:11.589 align:start position:0%
any questions comments okay with the
suggestions

02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
02:01:11.599 --> 02:01:16.580 align:start position:0%
suggestions
Congressman

02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:16.590 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.590 --> 02:01:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay so Mike would be a problem
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
getting that in for tomorrow you think
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
those it's not a
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
lot so while representative L's here I
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
had a question for her earlier it was
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention that uh there's
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
a large billboard in Manchester
 
02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.390 align:start position:0%
a large billboard in Manchester
advertising

02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh in Massachusetts and she
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
assured me that somewhere within the
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
language here there was something that
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
would prohibit out ofate advertising I
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
saw stuff for neon son and stuff like
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
that but so there is I probably missed
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
it but yes that's in a section that was
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
not changed by the amendment so if we
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
were to have this drafted as a replace
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
all if OS has the time then you'd be
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
able to find that within the language um
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
but it had it prohibits the advertising
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
and it has fines so by having the fines
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to stop those out ofate
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
advertisements for cannabis billb
 
02:02:18.189 --> 02:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
birds all
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
right the pleasure of the division are
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%

division has something to present
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
