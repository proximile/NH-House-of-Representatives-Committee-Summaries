that
 
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
that move took place
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'll start with that thank you senator
 
00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
gaivan for the record patricia tilley
 
00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
director of public health um thank you
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
for that question so i was but a baby
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
when that happened it was a long time
 
00:34:57.189 --> 00:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
ago in the early 2000s that that moved
 
00:34:59.590 --> 00:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
over um so i wasn't privy to the
 
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
information at that time but at one
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
point it was housed within um hhs and
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
worked closely with all of our
 
00:35:08.629 --> 00:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
informatics like um vital records is
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
housed in almost every other state in
 
00:35:12.229 --> 00:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
the country within a department of
 
00:35:14.149 --> 00:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
health i think my colleagues from
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state might have some
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
additional information about the
 
00:35:21.189 --> 00:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i we're not prepared to answer that
 
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't know we're going to go into the
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
history of
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
the move so i i can get back to the
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
committee with the findings but um one
 
00:35:30.709 --> 00:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
of the things that i would like to say
 
00:35:32.709 --> 00:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
many times vital records is looked at as
 
00:35:37.189 --> 00:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
vital statistics and health statistics
 
00:35:38.629 --> 00:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
but that's very
 
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know it is a big part of what we do
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
but it's also not only what we do
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
records are held under the secretary of
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
state many records for this state
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
and um i
 
00:35:52.229 --> 00:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
coming from the town clerk so i worked
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
as a town clerk
 
00:35:55.669 --> 00:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
in the town clerk's office for 32 years
 
00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the town of guilford and i know the
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
town clerk's association was behind the
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
move so that the focus could be on
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
the vital records portion of it
 
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
because we do a lot of servicing of
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
other state agencies um the general
 
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.910 align:start position:0%
other state agencies um the general
public

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're involved with
 
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.070 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're involved with
immigration

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
it goes much deeper than public health
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
and so i think i could um put together
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
some information
 
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
for you based on
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
and if i could just follow up that um we
 
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
have worked in partnership since that
 
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
change and we've worked at a um both in
 
00:36:34.709 --> 00:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
statute there's a partnership listed out
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
but just collegially we work in
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
partnership every single day we can't in
 
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
the department of health do our work
 
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
without vital statistics
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yes go ahead thank you madam chair
 
00:36:46.709 --> 00:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
so is there any formal mou or
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's defined then thank you
 
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.350 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's defined then thank you
okay

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.629 --> 00:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i we we we
 
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony about vital records
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
being a division of secretary of state a
 
00:37:10.709 --> 00:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
couple months ago in this committee
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
i i don't recall
 
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
exactly how formal the data requests are
 
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
from when
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
dhhs asks for access to vital records
 
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.910 align:start position:0%
dhhs asks for access to vital records
data

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:37:27.189 --> 00:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
and um you know and but i'm i remember
 
00:37:29.669 --> 00:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
the impression that there's essentially
 
00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
a firewall between vital records and
 
00:37:36.709 --> 00:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
and the public health people um that
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that firewall
 
00:37:41.669 --> 00:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
has some formal procedures to get beyond
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
it and get access to the data
 
00:37:46.629 --> 00:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
would you please uh remind me remind the
 
00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:47.669 align:start position:0%
would you please uh remind me remind the
committee

00:37:47.669 --> 00:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the formality
 
00:37:52.629 --> 00:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
of which it takes somebody in public
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
health to get access to vital records
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
data for a particular study
 
00:37:59.590 --> 00:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:38:01.189 --> 00:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i don't know if
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
um i was trying to follow your question
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to follow the data from um
 
00:38:08.629 --> 00:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
department of state to public health or
 
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
you just want to understand a little bit
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
of how in public health we determine
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
that uh to clarify the question i'm i'm
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
curious about the formality of which the
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
public health people ask for access to
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
vital statistics data so i'm imagining
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the old world we would do a form that
 
00:38:29.669 --> 00:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
would have all the data we wanted access
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
to with a description of why we wanted
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
it and that it would go over to vital
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
statistics so that they could
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
independently assure that that was a
 
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.470 align:start position:0%
independently assure that that was a
valid

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
request you know i'm i'm wondering about
 
00:38:43.669 --> 00:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
the formality at which we get access to
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
data so we have a formal data governance
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
and data stewardship process that we use
 
00:38:50.709 --> 00:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
to identify who should have access to
 
00:38:53.669 --> 00:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
that data um the vital records data sits
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
through our mou and please correct me if
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong denise through that mou the um
 
00:39:02.629 --> 00:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
data moves from secretary of state's
 
00:39:04.229 --> 00:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
office into the department of health and
 
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
human services and it's housed within
 
00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
our ebi our elect
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
our um
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
warehouse our data warehouse which is
 
00:39:13.669 --> 00:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
what i used to call it it sits within
 
00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
that data warehouse and then for an
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
individual dhhs staff member to have
 
00:39:20.629 --> 00:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
access to that data warehouse they need
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be having a particular role so again
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
we have a governance and a stewardship
 
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
program so they may have a particular
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
role that allows them or if they need it
 
00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
for a specific purpose that gets worked
 
00:39:34.149 --> 00:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
through our governance process um behind
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
me i have um chadwichala who is the head
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
of our informatics section and she takes
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
the lead role in ensuring in protecting
 
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
that data so that only those who have
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
authorized access can can get it
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes senator rosenwald sorry could um
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
could you clarify for us please if
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
the division of vital
 
00:40:03.669 --> 00:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
records or statistics
 
00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
records or statistics
um

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
is either a hipaa covered entity
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
or has a signed hipaa business associate
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
contract with the department of health
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think our mou
 
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
i think our mou
does

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
say that that we will have a hipaa
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
that we all meet hipaa requirements it's
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
it is part of our mou
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry was is is it a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
hipaa business associate
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
contract also yeah so i i mean obviously
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:40:43.669 --> 00:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
services is a covered entity and has
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that and so when we we through our mou
 
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
all of our work has to be within that
 
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.510 align:start position:0%
all of our work has to be within that
environment

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
my question was about the
 
00:40:59.350 --> 00:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
division of vital records not
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
that she didn't know
 
00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:28.229 align:start position:0%
that she didn't know
okay

00:41:28.229 --> 00:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
i know that we meet hipaa requirements
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
if that's what the question is
 
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
if that's what the question is
well

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
where i was going is that
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
in statute there are strict requirements
 
00:41:43.669 --> 00:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
on who can get certain data
 
00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
being a genealogist
 
00:41:48.229 --> 00:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
i cannot get
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
data from anyone who isn't
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
75 in
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
population records and older than that
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not this is not an open record
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
could you just summarize some of the
 
00:42:02.709 --> 00:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
policies that you have maybe that would
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
satisfy senator rosenwald and
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
so that she would understand
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
so are you asking about
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
the general public
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
being able to see
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
certain documentations
 
00:42:18.229 --> 00:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
are you talking about
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
staff members in general
 
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
just a minute
 
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes please uh it's
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
who has access okay um
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
and is that access identifiable down to
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
an individual or
 
00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
you know those kind of things are the
 
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:42:40.229 --> 00:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
are protected by hipaa
 
00:42:40.239 --> 00:42:41.510 align:start position:0%
are protected by hipaa
and

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
certainly i'm sure that the senator
 
00:42:44.239 --> 00:42:45.189 align:start position:0%
certainly i'm sure that the senator
wants

00:42:45.189 --> 00:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
wants
 
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
um you know assurance that
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
that we're not violating hipaa even
 
00:42:52.149 --> 00:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
though we may not
 
00:42:54.709 --> 00:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
have it in some way thank you
 
00:42:56.709 --> 00:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
i think um catherine cheney's here from
 
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
our i.t department and she can probably
 
00:43:00.229 --> 00:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
explain um the tracking and the
 
00:43:02.229 --> 00:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
different things that we have within our
 
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
software system
 
00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
and not everybody in the department has
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
access to everything it depends on their
 
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
access to everything it depends on their
role

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
role
 
00:43:10.629 --> 00:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
if that's what you're looking for
 
00:43:11.669 --> 00:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
catherine yeah
 
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
i what i'm hearing is um that
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
there needs to be clarification on the
 
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.149 align:start position:0%
there needs to be clarification on the
um

00:43:18.149 --> 00:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:20.709 --> 00:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
specifically what i'm hearing is medical
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
information in regards to personally
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
identifying information and is that
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
information available to
 
00:43:30.149 --> 00:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
other people i've also heard that do we
 
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a hipaa compliant a person
 
00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
or some type of assigned business
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
hipaa compliant person on staff
 
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
those are the two
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
things that i've heard the first
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
question is that
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
our data is
 
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.070 align:start position:0%
our data is
like

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.189 align:start position:0%
like
what

00:43:51.189 --> 00:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
trisha had said that is protected by
 
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
roles we have roles in our system
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
the you know stellar upgrades of the
 
00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
system is that only certain people can
 
00:44:04.629 --> 00:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
see these records within our own
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
departments and then every day
 
00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
these records specifically the
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
ones we're talking about for dhhs the
 
00:44:15.669 --> 00:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
death and birth records are
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
put into the data warehouse where they
 
00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
have access to all the information the
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
externally facing
 
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.550 align:start position:0%
externally facing
files

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
files
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
never files never in web specifically
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
are used for statistics and only numbers
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
are put into that system and for
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
genealogy that would be part of the
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
research area in a different
 
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
a different area you wouldn't use any of
 
00:44:41.669 --> 00:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
our system files so anything that's
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
externally facing is non-identifiable
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
just mostly numbers
 
00:44:48.629 --> 00:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
um and then we do not have i don't think
 
00:44:50.709 --> 00:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
we have a hyper-compliant person on
 
00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
staff i do know we have a nasologist and
 
00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
we are one of the few states lucky
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
enough to have a nasologist who can code
 
00:45:00.149 --> 00:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh causes of death and understands what
 
00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
that what that really is
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
again that each staff member has access
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
to everything it is role-based very
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
similar to dhhs
 
00:45:10.709 --> 00:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
where it's based on the individual's
 
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
need based on their work so
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
for instance if somebody's working just
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
in depth and they don't have any need to
 
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
be in birth we identify it
 
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
through approval through the director
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
and also um they're role based in the
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
computer system to begin with so they
 
00:45:30.149 --> 00:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
they can't get to certain items
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh rep senator guida thank you
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair i think the nexus or the the
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
condensed version of the question is
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
is the department of state division of
 
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
vital records
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
required either through the mou or a
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
associate business agreement
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be compliant with hipaa
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes we are compliant with hipaa we are
 
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.790 align:start position:0%

representative edwards uh thank you
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i i just have uh
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
just a general concern that i think has
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
been consistent over several meetings
 
00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
now and that is
 
00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:19.589 align:start position:0%
now and that is
that

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
in the previous budget year we
 
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
under funded i think arguably
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
underfunded i.t enhancements
 
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
and this this budget term
 
00:49:32.149 --> 00:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the state money and the federal
 
00:49:32.159 --> 00:49:33.030 align:start position:0%
with the state money and the federal
money

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh we've opened up a massive spigot of
 
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
cash to go towards uh i.t
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
and what i would like to see at some
 
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.430 align:start position:0%
and what i would like to see at some
point

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.390 align:start position:0%
point
is

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
a summary by the department a portfolio
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
analysis of all of the projects going on
 
00:49:54.709 --> 00:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
although the people that need to be
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
hired or who have been hired
 
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
so that we we have a sense
 
00:50:02.629 --> 00:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
that in the aggregate this this money
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
that we're allocating in
 
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.229 align:start position:0%
that we're allocating in
each's

00:50:06.229 --> 00:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
each's
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
is in the portfolio level
 
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
being responsibly managed and i suspect
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:50:16.229 --> 00:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
but um and just not it's not an answer
 
00:50:18.229 --> 00:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
for today it's a heads up
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
that i've asked hhs oversight to make it
 
00:50:24.149 --> 00:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
an agenda item so you've got a couple
 
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
months but
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
i i really i really am lost in the
 
00:50:31.189 --> 00:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
portfolio of not seeing the portfolio as
 
00:50:33.669 --> 00:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
we approve these each's
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay we can um figure out a way to do
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
that what i would mention is i don't
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
believe there's an i.t project
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
associated with this item
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry i i'm seeing
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
data modernization am i on the wrong one
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i am on the wrong one
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
all right so i was on the wrong one and
 
00:50:51.669 --> 00:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
that was really embarrassing that's okay
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay but you had us reading it as
 
00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
well yeah but my comment was generic
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
enough that i think you'll still run
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
with it thank you i understood that
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%

december so i wasn't here when the item
 
00:53:42.629 --> 00:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
was tabled but
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
like to understand better
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
if you're having a hard time hiring
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
and you have vacancies
 
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
explain to me about why you don't have
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
excess money in your
 
00:54:02.149 --> 00:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
budget at this point to pay for hiring
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
people and
 
00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
just a little bit follow up on that
 
00:54:08.229 --> 00:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's hard right now to hire people for
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
any job
 
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to understand a little more
 
00:54:14.229 --> 00:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
about where you think the we're going to
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
find these people and where this agency
 
00:54:17.669 --> 00:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
will find them
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
and why is it only a seven month
 
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
and why is it only a seven month
contract

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i will answer the first question and
 
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
then um turn it over to the commissioner
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
director ribson so karen rounds chief
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
financial officer dhhs
 
00:54:36.149 --> 00:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
um so i did distribute to uh the lba the
 
00:54:38.229 --> 00:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 22 budget which also
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
included 1920 and 21 at the bottom
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i hope that that was distributed to
 
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.589 align:start position:0%
the committee
the

00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
total budget appropriated for sysc was
 
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
10.4 million which included general
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
funds and
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
other and federal funds
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
part of what we budgeted um for in
 
00:54:59.830 --> 00:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and 23 was
 
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
funds from the state of vermont because
 
00:55:04.709 --> 00:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
we do have a contract with them to
 
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
take kids from the state of vermont at
 
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.709 align:start position:0%
take kids from the state of vermont at
sysc

00:55:08.709 --> 00:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
00:55:10.629 --> 00:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
what we have found now being six months
 
00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
through the year which is when we
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
typically are able to do the first set
 
00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
of reliable projections is that the
 
00:55:20.149 --> 00:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
revenue from vermont is going to be less
 
00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're predicting about
 
00:55:24.709 --> 00:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
a little over a million dollars less
 
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
and the way that
 
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
and the way that
um

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
the the law is written
 
00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
we must write down the appropriation if
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're not anticipating the revenue
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
so we are anticipating writing down
 
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.270 align:start position:0%
so we are anticipating writing down
um

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
by that a million or so dollars leaving
 
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
us a budget of about 9.5 million
 
00:55:46.629 --> 00:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
the expenditures so far this year are
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
about 5.2 million there's encumbrances
 
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
that are a little over a half a million
 
00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
um we have spent um about
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
277 thousand dollars
 
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
in overtime of staff that are not
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
employed by sysc so employed um by
 
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and dcyf so we should transfer
 
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
that expense to sysc um which is about
 
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
277 thousand
 
00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
dollars um there is a slight addition to
 
00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
the budget uh because of the raise that
 
00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
will happen on seven one
 
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh we are anticipating having to make
 
00:56:26.229 --> 00:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
some additional payouts when people
 
00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
retire for about fifty six thousand
 
00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.589 align:start position:0%
retire for about fifty six thousand
dollars

00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
leaving our expense projections um for
 
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year around 4.2 million
 
00:56:37.189 --> 00:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
what i would also mention is in the
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures already to date
 
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.870 align:start position:0%
expenditures already to date
is

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
303 000
 
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.550 align:start position:0%
303 000
of

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
retirement payouts from reductions in
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
force that we did at the beginning of
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year to meet this budget
 
00:56:54.149 --> 00:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
so with that we're expecting total
 
00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures to be 10.3 million which
 
00:56:58.709 --> 00:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
you'll note is less than the total
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was given for sysc
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
but because of that revenue write down
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
we actually have about an 800 000
 
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the sysc budget so in
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
addition to these funds to support this
 
00:57:12.149 --> 00:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
contract we will be coming back to the
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
committee with a transfer transferring
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
funds from elsewhere in the department
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
to cover that eight hundred thousand
 
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.350 align:start position:0%
to cover that eight hundred thousand
dollars

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.070 align:start position:0%
dollars
so

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
the budget is less than what total
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
budget is less than what is appropriated
 
00:57:27.189 --> 00:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
but because that revenue right down we
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
so i can speak to why the contract is a
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
short contract this really is a bridge
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
contract to our transition contract
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
we've talked now for several years about
 
00:57:46.149 --> 00:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
finding a replacement facility for sysc
 
00:57:48.229 --> 00:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
and i don't think there's ever been a
 
00:57:50.149 --> 00:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
time in the past where the department
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
has been as committed as it is now to
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
closing sysc and moving those kids into
 
00:57:58.629 --> 00:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
a more clinical model um it isn't just
 
00:57:58.639 --> 00:58:00.070 align:start position:0%
a more clinical model um it isn't just
sysc

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
00:58:01.669 --> 00:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we made that commitment to if you
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
recall a couple years ago we committed
 
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.310 align:start position:0%
recall a couple years ago we committed
to

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
closing the laconia drf which had been
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
open for 30 years and everyone said we
 
00:58:10.629 --> 00:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
could never close it and we closed it in
 
00:58:12.149 --> 00:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
about a year
 
00:58:14.229 --> 00:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
we're in the same place with sysc but
 
00:58:17.189 --> 00:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
between now and when we build
 
00:58:17.199 --> 00:58:18.790 align:start position:0%
between now and when we build
renovate

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
renovate
 
00:58:20.629 --> 00:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
buy another building
 
00:58:22.229 --> 00:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
we need to provide safe level of
 
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
staffing for the kids cobit has required
 
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
us to open quarantine units we have more
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
kids on two to one and one to one
 
00:58:30.149 --> 00:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
all of these
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
were unknown at the time that the budget
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
was developed for sysc so it's it's
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
caused an escalation in our personnel
 
00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
costs we're not able to hire for a
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
this contractor has serviced other areas
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the state have been very successful
 
00:58:49.189 --> 00:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
in getting temporary workforce for other
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
areas of dhhs and other areas of the
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
state so we're confident that they'll be
 
00:58:54.629 --> 00:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
able to do it
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
um so like i said it's a bridge we need
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
we need transition time
 
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.790 align:start position:0%
we need transition time
between

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:59:02.709 --> 00:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
making the commitment to close it and
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
actually closing it and we need to
 
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
provide safe
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
a safe environment in that time if we're
 
00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
not able to provide a safe environment
 
00:59:12.709 --> 00:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
there are there are alternatives none of
 
00:59:14.629 --> 00:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
them are excuse me none of them are good
 
00:59:16.629 --> 00:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
for the kids none of them are good for
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
the state that includes sending kids out
 
00:59:20.149 --> 00:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean massachusetts or
 
00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
vermont i'm talking far away out of
 
00:59:25.189 --> 00:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
state because they don't have beds
 
00:59:25.199 --> 00:59:26.310 align:start position:0%
state because they don't have beds
either

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
sending kids with mental health
 
00:59:31.669 --> 00:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
issues to emergency room boarding
 
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
which is not a great place to be
 
00:59:36.229 --> 00:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
right now because of covid and the
 
00:59:38.149 --> 00:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals are overwhelmed so we're
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
trying everything we can to care for
 
00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
these kids in place until we have that
 
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
replacement facility
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
senator guy do you have a question yes
 
00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
madam sure thank you
 
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.950 align:start position:0%
madam sure thank you
so

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't hire these people
 
01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
will we have
 
01:00:04.709 --> 01:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
our kids going out of state
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
if we don't find additional temporary
 
01:00:12.629 --> 01:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
staff or hire our own staff which we
 
01:00:14.629 --> 01:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
haven't been successful in
 
01:00:16.709 --> 01:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
there is a good possibility that if we
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
continue to lose staff or our population
 
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
goes up or becomes more acute that we
 
01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
will either have to send kids out of
 
01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
state to a detention facility out of
 
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.109 align:start position:0%
state to a detention facility out of
state

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
send them to the
 
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
the kids that have mental health issues
 
01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
send them to the emergency room and have
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
them board there
 
01:00:36.229 --> 01:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
there there will have to be other
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
alternatives to care that are not
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the kids and if
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
i can just add to that that will also
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
come with additional cost so i would
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
have to come back with an item to pay
 
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up yes madam chair
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
are you able to quantify in fairly
 
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
specific terms what the cost of one
 
01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.149 --> 01:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
these high-level facilities tend to cost
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere around seventeen hundred
 
01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
would you mind stating your name for the
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
right i'm sorry joe ripson director of
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
dcyf thank you
 
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
just for comparison what is our daily
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
rate we were charging vermont wasn't
 
01:01:30.629 --> 01:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
like 1600 i think it's about 1700 i
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
think it might be just under
 
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.189 align:start position:0%
think it might be just under
so

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:35.669 --> 01:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
the cost i
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
a child at sysc is
 
01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
about the same as sending them out of
 
01:01:40.719 --> 01:01:41.589 align:start position:0%
about the same as sending them out of
state

01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's comparable but if you don't totally
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
close down sysc you still have to manage
 
01:01:50.149 --> 01:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
an essential basic operation and as
 
01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
we've spoken about in the past
 
01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
one of the big challenges fiscally with
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
sysc is we've long gone below the census
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
that makes the economies of scale make
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
sense we had a lot of conversations
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
about that in this
 
01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.350 align:start position:0%
about that in this
falls

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
falls
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee to study the closure and
 
01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
replacement of sysc
 
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.149 align:start position:0%
replacement of sysc
so

01:02:08.149 --> 01:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
sending kids out of state is unlikely to
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
get every child out of sysc there's not
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of options out there
 
01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
right now we're having difficulty
 
01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
placing kids out of state for other
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
reasons and there aren't local like
 
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
neighboring states that are willing to
 
01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
take these kids so i'm not even sure
 
01:02:24.709 --> 01:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
that that's a viable option but that
 
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
would be the next
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
the next thing we would try and would
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
probably be worse for the kids that we
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
have there now thank you are there any
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and um
 
01:02:41.669 --> 01:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
you you
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
you said something that got me wondering
 
01:02:47.669 --> 01:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that we're still trying to
 
01:02:48.709 --> 01:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
three basic options uh renovate remodel
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
i forget what the third one was but but
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter to my question what
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
it leaves me with the impression that
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
here we are in january and a lot of
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
people are expecting um the solution to
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
be available
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
in april of next year where that's you
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
know very close
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so um i would like to know from you
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
two things
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh is is are you is are you
 
01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
strategically leaning one way or another
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
on how to do the replacement part on the
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
sununu closure uh and what are the odds
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
01:03:32.709 --> 01:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
of us having it done
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
before the end of this budget year
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
june 30 2000 whatever 23.
 
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
june 30 2000 whatever 23.
the

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that we will close doors
 
01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
of sysc prior to june 30 of 2023.
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think that we will be well on our way
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
to closing doors like
 
01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
whether that's in construction for
 
01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
renovation or building i think that will
 
01:03:58.629 --> 01:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
be well underway but i don't know that
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
we would be ready to close doors by june
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
2023 it just depends on construction
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
schedules and things like that
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
um i we're still looking at the options
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
for property
 
01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
the restrictions on the land in
 
01:04:14.709 --> 01:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
manchester there's a lot of legal issues
 
01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
that are around those different items
 
01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
that that we have to investigate before
 
01:04:19.199 --> 01:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
that that we have to investigate before
we

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
come with uh for certain recommendations
 
01:04:25.189 --> 01:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
now the we formed a commission last
 
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
summer that submitted a report to the
 
01:04:28.629 --> 01:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
legislative commission around our
 
01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations the legislative
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
commission then submitted their own
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations around what they thought
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
they would do i think
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to find
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
what we end up doing to be somewhere a
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
combination of both of those things
 
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not leaning one way or the other i'm
 
01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
really waiting for legal to kind of
 
01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
um really investigate what my options
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
are on the different state properties uh
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
what we need legislatively to make a
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
change what we need budget-wise to to
 
01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
make that change to fund those projects
 
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's the phase it's in right now
 
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
that's the phase it's in right now
follow-up

01:05:03.189 --> 01:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh so it sounds like you you all have to
 
01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
come back at some point to give us um a
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
budget proposal to get you all the way
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
through the budget year because i don't
 
01:05:16.149 --> 01:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
believe your budget was built to take
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
you there
 
01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious when you might be
 
01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
coming back with with what what what the
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
real financial need is to get us through
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
the budget term
 
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.629 align:start position:0%
the budget term
so

01:05:30.629 --> 01:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a difficult
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
question to answer for sure because it
 
01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
have to have a sense of what the plan
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward is to know
 
01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.350 align:start position:0%
moving forward is to know
um

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
what we might need but i i think it'll
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
be next fiscal year before we come back
 
01:05:46.629 --> 01:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
because we'll need to
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
figure out where the vermont funds are
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
at that point um we'll need the way that
 
01:05:54.149 --> 01:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
the appropriation was done for sysc it
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
was just a lump sum appropriation so we
 
01:05:58.550 --> 01:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
have to go through and figure out um you
 
01:06:00.149 --> 01:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
know all the different class lines what
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
the employment looks like at that point
 
01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
and and then figure out how much we'll
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
need for funds so it won't be until the
 
01:06:08.229 --> 01:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
state that state state fiscal year 23
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
begins thank you
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:19.189 --> 01:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
daniels senator daniels sorry thank you
 
01:06:19.199 --> 01:06:20.149 align:start position:0%
daniels senator daniels sorry thank you
um

01:06:20.149 --> 01:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
i think last last we had heard reported
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
from you there were only one or two
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh youth from vermont
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
how many did we lose
 
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think overall we've had a total of
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
seven since the contract started over a
 
01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
at this point we have zero we've
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
actually had to decline
 
01:06:42.149 --> 01:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
requests five requests to take kids over
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
the last couple months because our
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
staffing situation was so tough that we
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't handle additional youth within
 
01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.069 align:start position:0%
okay so
the

01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
the reduction didn't take place all at
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
once is that correct
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned we've lost seven over
 
01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
the last year no it's not about losing
 
01:07:06.149 --> 01:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
them so the way that the contract is
 
01:07:08.229 --> 01:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
written is that um vermont makes a
 
01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
request to us to take a child um on
 
01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
their behalf so it's not that we had
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
seven there and then it's slowly reduced
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a one-off situation they
 
01:07:19.189 --> 01:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
call when they have a need
 
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so what director ripson is saying is
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
that we've had seven different children
 
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
there since the contract began for
 
01:07:26.629 --> 01:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
varying periods of time not for the
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
entire period of time and that since
 
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
then they've made additional requests um
 
01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
and we've not been able to um
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
to meet their requests because of
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
staffing okay so what's the expectation
 
01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the revenue that you expected to get
 
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
revenue from vermont
 
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
revenue from vermont
but

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so our expectation was that we
 
01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
would have somewhere between one and two
 
01:07:49.189 --> 01:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
kids for the entire year okay
 
01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
kids for the entire year okay
um

01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
what is our population now
 
01:07:56.629 --> 01:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
today's census is 14.
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
i do have i think representative
 
01:08:00.229 --> 01:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
umberger asked last time to get you know
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of whatever week has looked
 
01:08:03.189 --> 01:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
like so i could share that if folks are
 
01:08:03.199 --> 01:08:04.870 align:start position:0%
like so i could share that if folks are
interested

01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
and and i believe that when you went
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
through the budget you probably
 
01:08:12.229 --> 01:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
budgeted for 18.
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
no we were
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
we were budgeting thinking you'd have on
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
average 12 because that's what our
 
01:08:18.629 --> 01:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
average daily census had been
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
but there's a difference in the needs of
 
01:08:22.069 --> 01:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
the kids that we're serving right now
 
01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
particularly over the past two months
 
01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
and that we've had a high number of high
 
01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
acuity kids
 
01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
who we've tried to move into
 
01:08:31.109 --> 01:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
high level
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
facilities or acute care facilities but
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
because those facilities are so
 
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.189 align:start position:0%
because those facilities are so
overwhelmed

01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed
 
01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's been a long it takes a long time
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
with a long time on a waiting list to
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
get kids into those facilities so kids
 
01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
have been who are very high need that
 
01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
often require two to one supervision are
 
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
staying in sysc for a longer period of
 
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
time than they typically would because
 
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to move them on has been cut
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
off by the children's mental health
 
01:08:59.350 --> 01:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
creation crisis nationwide
 
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
creation crisis nationwide
so

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
directions that we were given
 
01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
on trying to find a replacement for
 
01:09:05.119 --> 01:09:06.390 align:start position:0%
on trying to find a replacement for
sununu

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
where we were told that you needed space
 
01:09:10.629 --> 01:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
for 18.
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
why would you budget for 12
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
when you're telling the committee that
 
01:09:16.629 --> 01:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
you needed space for 18
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
because the the request for space for 18
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
was not just about having 18 beds but
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
having the flexibility for when kids go
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
higher and when kids go lower the census
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
has varied between as low as 6 and as
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
high as i think 16 over the past
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
so you have flexibility you have
 
01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
movement in there and it changes every
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
day every week
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
you also have needs to separate children
 
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
based on gender based on court orders
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
based on their individual clinical needs
 
01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
so when you have fixed space on a fixed
 
01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
so when you have fixed space on a fixed
unit

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
you can't necessarily use every single
 
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
bed right if you have one unit that has
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
six beds for six girls but you only have
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
two girls in the facility and you have
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
eight girls and eight boys in the
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
facility you're not able to maximize all
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
of the building space so the
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
conversation around a new facility for
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
18 beds was largely related to the
 
01:10:08.629 --> 01:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility to meet the discrete needs
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
of youth and have you spread
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately throughout the facility
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
not that we anticipated having the
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
facility full at 18 at all times
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
if i can just add to that we also look
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
to budget conservatively conservatively
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
so we budgeted on the average rather
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
than the maximum
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
we could certainly budget on the maximum
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then lapse more funds but that's not
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
we try not to do that okay was i wrong
 
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
we try not to do that okay was i wrong
in

01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
i guess assuming that you were budgeting
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
for the worst case scenario
 
01:10:40.629 --> 01:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
um i mean there are certain there are
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
certainly times that i budget for the
 
01:10:43.109 --> 01:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario because i'm
 
01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
expecting the worst case scenario and in
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
this case it's based on trends we felt
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable budgeting on the
 
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.149 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable budgeting on the
average

01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:50.950 align:start position:0%
average
okay

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.750 align:start position:0%
okay
and

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know the similar question with your
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
staffing level um
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
what what were you figuring on a ratio
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:06.069 --> 01:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
the the main staff we're talking about
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
here are the youth counselors is the
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
direct care staff there's also a lot of
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
other staff within the facility
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
which which largely hit that economies
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
of scale issue i spoke to speaking about
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
earlier whether you have one kid or 10
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
kids in the building 12 kids in the
 
01:11:19.589 --> 01:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
building 15 kids a building you need
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
nurses you need clinicians you need
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
mental health psychiatrists
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
psychologists doctors that are coming
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
out you need all of those things
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of the level of kids
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
but the youth counselors which is what
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
this request is about is the one that's
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
most dynamic
 
01:11:35.109 --> 01:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
you typically need
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't have anything extraordinary
 
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.589 align:start position:0%
if you don't have anything extraordinary
happening

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
one youth counselor and system to
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
monitor central control without somebody
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
sitting there to monitor central control
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
which has all the cameras and access and
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
control over all the doors there's no
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
way for people to move through the
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
building so you need one youth counselor
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
in that space and typically you want two
 
01:11:54.069 --> 01:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
youth counselors on every open unit
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
because you don't want one one youth
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
counselor with multiple kids
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
just a high risk situation do that staff
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
aren't comfortable we don't think it's
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
safer appropriate
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
so you often typically would have three
 
01:12:09.109 --> 01:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
units open one for girls two for boys
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
some with boys with higher level needs
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
boys who have court orders that have to
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
be separated because they were involved
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
in the same type maybe in the same
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
criminal activity where they have you
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
know issues with each other or they're
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
involved in in different gangs or
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
something like that you have to keep
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
them separated so you typically on an
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
average day with nothing extraordinary
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
happening you need seven youth
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
councillors in the building to make the
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
building run
 
01:12:32.069 --> 01:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
this hasn't been an average time since
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
the start of covid we typically have a
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
young person who's sitting in our
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
medical unit
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
covet test and awaiting results before
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
they can be moved into the rest of the
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
facility when a young person is assigned
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
to medical for any reason a youth
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
counselor has to sit with them in
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
medical to make sure that they're safe
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and they're cared for the nursing staff
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
aren't appropriate to do that and the
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
nursing staff are running around the
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
building taking care of everybody else
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the building
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
then when you have situations like we've
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
had particularly high levels of over the
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
past month or so where you have youth
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
who have a two-to-one or one-to-one
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
supervision that incrementally adds the
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
needs for more staff
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
we had a young person in there recently
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
who was who had made multiple suicide
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
attempts required a two-to-one
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
supervision for well over a month even
 
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.709 align:start position:0%
supervision for well over a month even
overnight

01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
because the moment that that youth was
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
left alone they would actively try to
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
hurt themselves and we needed to have
 
01:13:24.069 --> 01:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
people there to make sure that didn't
 
01:13:24.079 --> 01:13:25.350 align:start position:0%
people there to make sure that didn't
happen

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
those types of scenarios have been
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
compounding towards towards the end of
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
this you know current coveted period
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
with the mental health system unable to
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
take these kids and that's what's
 
01:13:36.069 --> 01:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
driving a lot of this
 
01:13:38.069 --> 01:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
so the staffing that we
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we require really to be safe to
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
cover all of those shifts and that
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility each day depending on youth
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
needs is about 47 youth counselors in
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
the building that's what we're budgeted
 
01:13:49.109 --> 01:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
for we currently have 30 working in the
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
building and i actually received notice
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
from three more in the past few weeks
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.069 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
joe

01:14:02.069 --> 01:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
joe
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
just from my standpoint i've re i read
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
this last graph of the uh the request
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it says the funds will be used to
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
enter into a contract with the health
 
01:14:13.589 --> 01:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
care staffing agency to provide 18
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
temporary staff for the period of seven
 
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.709 align:start position:0%
temporary staff for the period of seven
weeks

01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
given today's
 
01:14:18.239 --> 01:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
given today's
economy

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
where are you going to where you're
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
going to get a staffing agency and what
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
happens if you can't find them
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
with a staffing agency what does that
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
leave us at this point in time so i'm
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner could speak to this
 
01:14:32.069 --> 01:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
too she has a governor and counsel but
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
the staffing agency that we actually we
 
01:14:35.589 --> 01:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
already have gnc approval on the
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
contract but it's not funded so it's not
 
01:14:39.109 --> 01:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
moved forward pending the action in this
 
01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
committee that's what the staffing
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
agency called maxim which has had a lot
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
of success within the state they've
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually already identified a number of
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
staff that are ready to start training
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
next week
um

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
but it's pending the action of this
 
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.149 align:start position:0%
but it's pending the action of this
committee

01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
good for the
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
chair yes
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
but we're going to pay dearly for the
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
staff is that correct
 
01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
staff is that correct
the

01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
this is a request that is for a little
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
over a hundred thousand dollars in our
 
01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for the staffing contract i
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
think that somewhere the staffing agency
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
is you know the total contract value is
 
01:15:11.589 --> 01:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
running hundred thousand dollars in
 
01:15:15.589 --> 01:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and senator rosenwald
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:23.589 --> 01:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
i thought i was following this but
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
this request would bring you up to like
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
50 youth counselors and we're budgeted
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
for 47 so i don't understand again now
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
why the money is not within the current
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation we're budgeted for 47
 
01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
youth councillors we currently have
 
01:15:41.589 --> 01:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
about 30 three more have given their
 
01:15:41.599 --> 01:15:42.550 align:start position:0%
about 30 three more have given their
notice

01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
this contract is for 18 because we're
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
anticipating we'd still have
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
turnover and dynamic situations with
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
hiring our own staff
 
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.149 align:start position:0%
hiring our own staff
as

01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
cfo rounds explained the problems with
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
the budget have to do with the
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
decline the declining revenue from the
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
vermont contract
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
unexpected or unbudgeted payouts for
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
staff that retired when we went through
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
the last round of
 
01:16:09.589 --> 01:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
restructuring staff as a result of the
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
budget cut at the start of this state
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we reduced 26 positions as a
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
result of that a lot of those staff
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
rather than be reassigned chose to
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
retire and when staff retire from state
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
service they get a payout for their for
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
their sick time etc that hit our budget
 
01:16:25.589 --> 01:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
was not something that we that we were
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
anticipating at the time that that
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
budget was crafted
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple things and the high
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
overtime usage
 
01:16:33.429 --> 01:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
what i would hope is that if we're
 
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
successful if this contract works and we
 
01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
get folks in that the overtime demand
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
will go down drastically there's you'll
 
01:16:40.309 --> 01:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
look in the budget that was distributed
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overtime going out
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
which costs a lot more than even the
 
01:16:46.389 --> 01:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
staffing contract would
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
typically we're paying juvenile
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
probation officers and now we even have
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
cpsws going in there to work overtime
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
because it's so desperate
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
and those folks are making a lot more
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
than even the staffing agency is getting
 
01:16:59.429 --> 01:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
paid when they're working overtime hours
 
01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
following yes thank you so given that
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
the department is
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
looking to move to more of a treatment
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
focused model with the new facility
 
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and we are going to stop using the
 
01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
parole officers
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
it hopefully
 
01:17:18.639 --> 01:17:19.990 align:start position:0%
it hopefully
is

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
is the department or the division able
 
01:17:24.549 --> 01:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
to commit to
 
01:17:24.559 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
to commit to
training

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
training
these

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
uh temporary youth counselors in a more
 
01:17:33.509 --> 01:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
treatment-oriented model than we've
 
01:17:36.469 --> 01:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
gotten from parole officers
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and we've we've already started
 
01:17:39.509 --> 01:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
that work although it's not complete
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've started moving into a model called
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
pbis at the at the moment i'm not
 
01:17:45.349 --> 01:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
remembering what the acronym stands for
 
01:17:47.509 --> 01:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
but our psychiatrist or psychologist
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's working down there has started
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
implementing that already the idea is to
 
01:17:53.349 --> 01:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
start to move folks into the direction
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
of being clinically oriented
 
01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
while we're in the process of moving
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
towards a new facility we also intend to
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
relook at those sjds change training and
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
education requirements and all of those
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
things to make sure that those staff are
 
01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
actually the right staff to do this more
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
clinically oriented mental health
 
01:18:10.549 --> 01:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
oriented treatment that we expect of
 
01:18:10.559 --> 01:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
oriented treatment that we expect of
them

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
but that hasn't been the historical
 
01:18:14.469 --> 01:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
model as you and many people know that's
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
the transition phase we're in the staff
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
that come in
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
the attempts that come in are going to
 
01:18:20.469 --> 01:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
be trained
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the same things that we're training
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
our current yc's on which do include
 
01:18:25.589 --> 01:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
training of things like pbis
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
the escalation strategies and things
 
01:18:28.469 --> 01:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
like that to continue the movement
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
towards a clinically based model but
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's as i said that's a work in
 
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
that's as i said that's a work in
progress

01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
progress
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
represented waldman
 
01:18:40.389 --> 01:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
so the 846
 
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.709 align:start position:0%
so the 846
000

01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
will pay
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll be able to recruit and
 
01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll be able to recruit and
pay

01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:18:51.429 --> 01:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
18 additional staff
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
for seven months and that will cover the
 
01:18:56.469 --> 01:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
846 thousand dollars will cover their
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
wages during that time
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
what if they only recruit
 
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.790 align:start position:0%
what if they only recruit
nine

01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
let's say they are only able to recruit
 
01:19:07.589 --> 01:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
nine then will you expend only four
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
hundred and some thousand
 
01:19:11.349 --> 01:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the contract yeah the way the
 
01:19:13.429 --> 01:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
contract is structured it's a it's an
 
01:19:15.349 --> 01:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
hourly rate per hour worked by temp
 
01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:16.629 align:start position:0%
hourly rate per hour worked by temp
employee

01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing paid if nobody works
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
and if everybody works every shift it's
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's the maximum
 
01:19:24.549 --> 01:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%

members of the committee uh it's good to
 
01:33:27.429 --> 01:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
to be back uh in in person again
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm glad uh madam chair you
 
01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh this as a briefing because
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
our our intent is to purposely be high
 
01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
our our intent is to purposely be high
level

01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:33:37.349 --> 01:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
given you know the ocean of information
 
01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's contained in a 162 page document
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're prepared and happy to go into
 
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
whatever level of detail the committee
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
would like
 
01:33:47.670 --> 01:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
but initially we'd like to make just
 
01:33:49.429 --> 01:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
some general high-level comments and
 
01:33:49.439 --> 01:33:50.309 align:start position:0%
some general high-level comments and
then

01:33:50.309 --> 01:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then uh management uh will kind of
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh drill a little deeper into a couple
 
01:33:57.349 --> 01:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
elements of the report but
 
01:34:00.630 --> 01:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
that that is background so uh when
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
whenever um i meet with a governing body
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
to discuss the um
 
01:34:08.389 --> 01:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
report i'd like to give a little bit of
 
01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
an overview of what kpmg is doing so
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
just just as a refresher
 
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.510 align:start position:0%
just just as a refresher
kpmg

01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
kpmg
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
does the audit of the annual
 
01:34:18.469 --> 01:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial statement which
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss uh today
 
01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh in in conjunction with that we are
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
that audit we also
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
issue a report on internal controls over
 
01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
financial reporting i believe that's
 
01:34:32.309 --> 01:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
also in your package and we'll touch
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
briefly on that as well
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
and if i were smart i'd know how to fix
 
01:34:44.469 --> 01:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
hang up on him
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
my apologies i'm out of practice as i've
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
admitted before
 
01:34:52.469 --> 01:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:34:54.469 --> 01:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
also kpmg
 
01:34:56.710 --> 01:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh hires us to do the
 
01:34:58.150 --> 01:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
separate audit of the turnpike and that
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
will be presented next week to the
 
01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
01:35:03.429 --> 01:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
and then of course we also do an audit
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh of the state's federal programs and
 
01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's something we would present to
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
this committee uh later on this winter
 
01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
early spring time
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
so with that just getting into uh the
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
annual comprehensive financial
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
statements and again the headline for us
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
is the audit opinion i like to remind
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee members in this 160 page
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
document there's one page that belongs
 
01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
to us and that's our opinion uh the rest
 
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
of it belongs to management and and the
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
headline there is is that uh we we are
 
01:35:35.349 --> 01:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
rendering unmodified opinions on the
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
contents of the annual comprehensive
 
01:35:39.429 --> 01:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
financial statements so we do our ride
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
it in a couple of uh in accordance with
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
professional standards both from the
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
aicpa as well as government auditing
 
01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
standards because you do receive
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
federal funding and that's where we get
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
that byproduct report on internal
 
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of in terms of other items in
 
01:35:58.710 --> 01:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
the report uh the other opinion that
 
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
might be of notice this year the
 
01:36:03.429 --> 01:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
the state adopted a new uh
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
government accounting standard board
 
01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.389 align:start position:0%
government accounting standard board
pronouncement

01:36:06.389 --> 01:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
pronouncement
 
01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
on fiduciary activities uh we noted it
 
01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
not in our opinion but for members of
 
01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
the committee it really was not as
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
impactful as maybe some other standards
 
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
has been in the past so uh we won't get
 
01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
into too much detail on that and then of
 
01:36:23.349 --> 01:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
course we also um perform limited
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
procedures on some of the supplemental
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
information included in the report
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
particularly over the
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh budget and
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
statements that are in the back of the
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
report as well as
 
01:36:37.429 --> 01:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
the supplementary information on the
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
status of your pension and open plans
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
which which is a personal favorite of
 
01:36:43.429 --> 01:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
mine and if there's questions on there
 
01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
be happy to entertain them
 
01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna i'm gonna move uh uh off of
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
the audit opinion for a minute and just
 
01:36:53.110 --> 01:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
briefly mention that separate report on
 
01:36:55.349 --> 01:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
internal controls over financial
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
reporting we have one item in there uh
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh been reporting the same
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
item for the last couple years
 
01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
um uh related to the credit carryovers i
 
01:37:06.389 --> 01:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
think that's a topic that we've
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
discussed at length
 
01:37:10.389 --> 01:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh at previous committee uh meetings
 
01:37:12.469 --> 01:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
happy to go into detail today if the
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee would like i i think the point
 
01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
here is that uh
 
01:37:20.309 --> 01:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
there is new hampshire is not unique
 
01:37:22.150 --> 01:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
most of your
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
businesses are
 
01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
making estimated payments and as of a
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
they are typically in a
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
overpaid position
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
meaning they've they've paid more taxes
 
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
and ultimately their returns are
 
01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.150 align:start position:0%
and ultimately their returns are
required

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's an accounting mechanism
 
01:37:40.150 --> 01:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
to determine uh whether you should
 
01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
recognize all of that as revenue or
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
retain a portion as
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
either unearned revenue or due back to
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer and so there's an academic
 
01:37:52.150 --> 01:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
exercise that we go through with dra
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
and uh i think the good news is that
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
number has kind of stabilized around 60
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the last couple
 
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
years but it is it is something that uh
 
01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing with management um
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
and and is
 
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
that that is the sole item in our uh
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
separate report on internal controls
 
01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to pause here for a minute
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
because i'll go on forever and i'll ask
 
01:38:13.349 --> 01:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
karen farrell to kind of jump in and
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
maybe go through some of the required
 
01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.389 align:start position:0%
maybe go through some of the required
communications

01:38:16.389 --> 01:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
communications
 
01:38:18.389 --> 01:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh that we typically go over when we
 
01:38:20.230 --> 01:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
meet with a governing body i will warn
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
you in advance that you are likely to
 
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
hear this again when kpmg shows up next
 
01:38:26.389 --> 01:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
week to do
 
01:38:29.349 --> 01:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
the turnpike presentation but i do think
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's important for us to to make
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure we communicate to you those items
 
01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
that are significant
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh as it relates to our audit so with
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm gonna turn it over to karen
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh representative edwards has
 
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
credit carryover yes yes so i was just a
 
01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
finance major because gaap scared me
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
it says in in the
 
01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
supplemental report
 
01:39:06.710 --> 01:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
we think our best estimate is about 64
 
01:39:12.309 --> 01:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in that neighborhood
 
01:39:16.309 --> 01:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
is is money that taxpayers
 
01:39:16.319 --> 01:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
is is money that taxpayers
aren't

01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to aren't expected to
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
apply to future
 
01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
tax payments
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
then it says that 64 million is not
 
01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
considered to be a liability and without
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
getting into the green eye shades thing
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
i it it feels like a liability to me and
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious why um just management
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
judgment whether or not it's required by
 
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
judgment whether or not it's required by
some

01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:42.710 align:start position:0%
some
rule

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:39:44.309 --> 01:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't just carry it as a
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
liability if we think it really is yeah
 
01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
i might just make one comment and then
 
01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
let and turn it over to
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh management
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe just to to put a finer point
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:39:58.389 --> 01:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:40:00.710 --> 01:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
most of your most of your taxpayers are
 
01:40:03.190 --> 01:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
calendar-based organizations and so they
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
are paying taxes based on a tax year
 
01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.510 align:start position:0%
are paying taxes based on a tax year
and

01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
most taxpayers who make estimated
 
01:40:13.429 --> 01:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
payments me being one of them in my own
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
personal life
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh oftentimes will will overpay with the
 
01:40:19.670 --> 01:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge that it would be applied to
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
the next quarterly payment
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is uh as of the tax
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
reporting year there's they have made an
 
01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.309 align:start position:0%
reporting year there's they have made an
overpayment

01:40:28.309 --> 01:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
overpayment
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then there's an analysis to done
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
then there's a separate analysis done to
 
01:40:34.309 --> 01:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
see how much of that overpayment would
 
01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
have been earned by the state by the end
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
of your fiscal year
 
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
there are different points in time
 
01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.030 align:start position:0%
there are different points in time
so

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would say that the taxpayers intent
 
01:40:46.150 --> 01:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
is to leave that money on deposit to be
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
for future taxes it just happens to
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
cross fiscal years so the accounting
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we're highlighting
 
01:40:57.429 --> 01:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's an estimate
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
of 64 million dollars that really
 
01:41:04.309 --> 01:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
applies to the next fiscal year
 
01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:41:08.469 --> 01:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh it's quite common every every uh
 
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
state that i'm aware of kind of runs
 
01:41:12.309 --> 01:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
into this situation the question is
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
should you should you record that money
 
01:41:17.190 --> 01:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
as revenue uh
 
01:41:20.309 --> 01:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
as of today or should you kind of
 
01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
report that revenue in the next fiscal
 
01:41:24.389 --> 01:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
period when it technically will be
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
earned and so
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're probably in a little green eye
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
shade category so i will pause
 
01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
shade category so i will pause
um

01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:34.389 --> 01:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe invite as a follow-up i i
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
think maybe you've you've uh shaken me
 
01:41:40.309 --> 01:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
enough to where i i now reread
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
the sentence the state however does not
 
01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
record a cco tax refund liability in its
 
01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
annual financial statements and the
 
01:41:50.469 --> 01:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
preceding paragraph left me with the
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
impression that we thought there was 64
 
01:41:54.710 --> 01:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars that would never be
 
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
applied to any future
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
tax payments so i i just misread the
 
01:42:02.309 --> 01:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so one of the things that i'm going
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
to go over is just a few uncorrected
 
01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
misstatements that we identified and
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
that is one so i think that you know
 
01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
just to kind of clarify a little when i
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
get to that point is that um you know i
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
think kpmg believes it should be a
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
liability as of june 30th 21 of the 64
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
million so we kind of include that in
 
01:42:24.309 --> 01:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
our analysis to see what would be
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
material and whether we can pass on that
 
01:42:29.349 --> 01:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
entry not being recorded in the state's
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
annual financial report and and we got
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
there with that one entry and then a few
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
others that i'll mention in a little bit
 
01:42:37.349 --> 01:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
but you know i think to answer your
 
01:42:39.349 --> 01:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
question we do kpmg does believe that it
 
01:42:41.429 --> 01:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
should be a liability that's recorded at
 
01:42:42.710 --> 01:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year
 
01:42:45.429 --> 01:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
each year and that's why it kind of
 
01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.630 --> 01:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
good morning dana call uh state
 
01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.750 align:start position:0%
good morning dana call uh state
comptroller

01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
comptroller
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes you will uh this issue obviously has
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
been ongoing for quite a while and uh
 
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
we've presented to senate finance in the
 
01:43:05.670 --> 01:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
past a similar finding so this is a kind
 
01:43:08.469 --> 01:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
of a repeat finding for us
 
01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
and we would agree that there is an
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
accounting determination that's made but
 
01:43:15.429 --> 01:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
there is also state legislative policy
 
01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:16.230 align:start position:0%
there is also state legislative policy
um

01:43:16.230 --> 01:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:19.670 --> 01:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
by you folks that uh in it it sort of
 
01:43:22.469 --> 01:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
conflicts in some scenarios and this is
 
01:43:24.389 --> 01:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
one of those scenarios because this
 
01:43:24.399 --> 01:43:25.349 align:start position:0%
one of those scenarios because this
would

01:43:25.349 --> 01:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
directly affect general fund surplus so
 
01:43:31.429 --> 01:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
if we were to record it it would have a
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
significant effect on the funding that
 
01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
you all use to create the state budget
 
01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
you all use to create the state budget
so

01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
one that has been one of the uh points
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
that we've been discussing over the past
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
several years so i'll let mr rowling
 
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.150 align:start position:0%
several years so i'll let mr rowling
house

01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
so one one of the things this is fun um
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've done over time you know this is
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue and it becomes an
 
01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
issue when things when things bump up
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
and when they bump down and i think i
 
01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
think probably
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
two or three major inflection points
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
over the last
 
01:44:05.429 --> 01:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know a dozen years i think
 
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
probably the big presentation to fiscal
 
01:44:10.309 --> 01:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
was probably four or five years ago
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
before my time technically and i've been
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner four and a half years so um
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
when you consider this um
 
01:44:20.389 --> 01:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
think of the kafir a bunch of different
 
01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
ways one is that it's an accounting
 
01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
document it's a state's major accounting
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
document it's our books
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's also a transparency document and an
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
accountability document
 
01:44:30.309 --> 01:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
and and one of the things that's very
 
01:44:32.389 --> 01:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
important from a state standpoint is
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't change
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
how we account for things we don't
 
01:44:38.389 --> 01:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
change what we do constantly so as to
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
confuse anybody trying to look at it
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to look at the state's
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
finances and see how we're doing they
 
01:44:46.230 --> 01:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
want to look at look at what we do it's
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
important that there be consistency over
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
time to the extent that there can be
 
01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
we do make changes when when gasby
 
01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
whoever gatsby actually is some obscure
 
01:44:57.349 --> 01:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
board hiding in connecticut but
 
01:44:59.349 --> 01:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
pronounces you know gatsby 80 and you'll
 
01:45:01.269 --> 01:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
have these discussions you know usb 78
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
is going to make us change everything
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
and it's opeb calculations a lot of
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
those calculations have to do with how
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state's books look
 
01:45:12.389 --> 01:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
are we are we carrying a 1.9
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollar opeb liability or is a
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
2.1 and what are the components of that
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
and you know functionally from a
 
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
practical decision-making standpoint um
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
those aren't really that different even
 
01:45:24.389 --> 01:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
though it sounds like a lot of money
 
01:45:24.399 --> 01:45:26.469 align:start position:0%
though it sounds like a lot of money
um

01:45:26.469 --> 01:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this the same way
 
01:45:32.469 --> 01:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
for for decades from time immemorial um
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
probably to the the the origin of the uh
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
business profits tax um
 
01:45:41.670 --> 01:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
and um to change it would make a sudden
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
budget change most of the accounting
 
01:45:46.150 --> 01:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
decisions we make do not suddenly take
 
01:45:48.710 --> 01:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
60 or 70 million dollars
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
off the books and remove them from your
 
01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
ability to spend them or balance the
 
01:45:54.389 --> 01:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
books with them
 
01:45:56.469 --> 01:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
and if we made a dramatic change one of
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
the reasons to not make a change is
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
because it looks different
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it and it makes things less
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
comparable another is that we would
 
01:46:05.349 --> 01:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
suddenly say 65 million dollars that you
 
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
you probably have and you should have
 
01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
and you probably will have because this
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
averages out and washes out in the end
 
01:46:14.710 --> 01:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
suddenly you don't and by the way
 
01:46:16.630 --> 01:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
dear fiscal committee could you write a
 
01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.590 align:start position:0%
dear fiscal committee could you write a
check

01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
check
 
01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
check
um

01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:20.389 --> 01:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
this happens to be a year when you
 
01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
when you're awash with money but it's
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
very rare that that's the case so it it
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
seemed like an obvious decision to not
 
01:46:30.469 --> 01:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
um book it that way even though
 
01:46:30.479 --> 01:46:31.590 align:start position:0%
um book it that way even though
um

01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and maybe i'll just make the last
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
couple of points on this topic
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
so the opinion that i mentioned earlier
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
on that we you know our opinion is your
 
01:46:46.710 --> 01:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
financial statements present fairly
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
contemplates this topic so so we still
 
01:46:51.670 --> 01:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
believe your financial statements
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
are presented fairly including this
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
the other point i would make is even
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
though we we refer to it as a liability
 
01:47:03.269 --> 01:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
these funds are available to you it's
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
just the timing of when you would
 
01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
recognize them so if you wanted to
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
substitute unearned revenue
 
01:47:12.150 --> 01:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
as a as a proxy for accounts payable
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
because we're not suggesting you write a
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
check necessarily back to the taxpayer
 
01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
this is really just an accounting
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism of when do you record that
 
01:47:21.190 --> 01:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
revenue the funds will be available for
 
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.469 align:start position:0%
revenue the funds will be available for
you

01:47:22.469 --> 01:47:22.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
right because you have them they're in
 
01:47:26.309 --> 01:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
your possession that they can be spent
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
so the cash flow
 
01:47:30.469 --> 01:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
none of this is affecting the cash flow
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just affecting the timing
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
of recording uh
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
a tax revenue
 
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll probably stop there because
 
01:47:42.469 --> 01:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
eyes will glaze over if we've if we've
 
01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
kind of gone into too much minutia but
 
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:47.269 align:start position:0%
kind of gone into too much minutia but
um

01:47:47.269 --> 01:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
i i would just add uh to that that
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
while we have been talking about this
 
01:47:54.309 --> 01:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
for years we have made some headway uh
 
01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the response the
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
management response to the finding that
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature has chosen to take a
 
01:48:02.469 --> 01:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
look at analyzing the credit carry over
 
01:48:06.309 --> 01:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
liability and putting caps on it and i'm
 
01:48:08.150 --> 01:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
a member of that commission should it
 
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
a member of that commission should it
ever

01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
ever
start

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
but there is legislation in play and
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
that has passed that is taking a look at
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
that so it's not that we're not we're
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
not ignoring the issue and we've been
 
01:48:22.150 --> 01:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
actively working with the legislature to
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
explain the issue with the department of
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
revenue uh and try to address it at
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
least from a high level going forward
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
to some more mundane topics um okay so
 
01:48:41.670 --> 01:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is karen farrell
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
and as brock mentioned under aicpa
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
auditing standards we're required to
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
communicate certain items to those
 
01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
charged with governance which is
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
yourselves so the first one being that
 
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
we do not identify any significant
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
unusual transactions it's a little bit
 
01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:56.389 align:start position:0%
unusual transactions it's a little bit
better

01:48:56.389 --> 01:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:48:58.469 --> 01:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
while performing the audit
 
01:49:00.230 --> 01:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
management and compiling their annual
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
financial statements needs to make
 
01:49:03.349 --> 01:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
judgments about accounting estimates
 
01:49:05.429 --> 01:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
like the tax receivables or the opeb
 
01:49:07.429 --> 01:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
obligation and we deem these to be
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable in all material respects
 
01:49:12.389 --> 01:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
in relation to the financial statements
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh we did not have any disagreements
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
with management or any scope limitations
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
in completing our audit
 
01:49:20.389 --> 01:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
as far as we are aware the state did not
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
seek out other
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
auditors opinions on the application of
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
generally accepted accounting principles
 
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
we did not have any major issues that we
 
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
discussed prior to being retained as
 
01:49:33.429 --> 01:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
auditors for the state
 
01:49:35.269 --> 01:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
we received full cooperation from the
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
state with management all the way down
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
to staff really at every level and
 
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
completing our audit
 
01:49:42.710 --> 01:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
we are required to confirm that we are
 
01:49:44.469 --> 01:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
independent accountants with respect to
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
the state under all relevant
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
professional and regulatory guidelines
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
we did not identify actual a suspected
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
fraud involving management or any
 
01:49:55.269 --> 01:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
employees that were in significant
 
01:49:57.269 --> 01:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
positions of internal control
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
and no fraud resulted in a material
 
01:50:01.590 --> 01:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
misstatement in the financial statements
 
01:50:03.269 --> 01:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
we did not identify material
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with laws and regulations
 
01:50:09.349 --> 01:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then lastly in addition to the cco
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
liability we just talked about we did
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
identify two other
 
01:50:14.630 --> 01:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
audit differences that weren't corrected
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the annual financial statements
 
01:50:18.230 --> 01:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
all of these audit differences
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
individually in the aggregate did not
 
01:50:22.230 --> 01:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
preclude us from providing an unmodified
 
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
preclude us from providing an unmodified
opinion

01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
but the second one was
 
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the prior year there was about 36 and
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
a half million of personal protective
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
equipment that was recorded in the
 
01:50:35.349 --> 01:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund in 21 that was
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
deemed to be reimbursable by fema so for
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
us to kind of analyze that transaction
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
being in a different period we proposed
 
01:50:43.429 --> 01:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
an entry to push those expenses back to
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund just so we could
 
01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
analyze the effect on the beginning
 
01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
analyze the effect on the beginning
equity

01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
equity
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then the second one was a reversal
 
01:50:52.710 --> 01:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the unemployment fund receivables
 
01:50:54.469 --> 01:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
that were booked in contemplation of
 
01:50:54.479 --> 01:50:55.670 align:start position:0%
that were booked in contemplation of
kiers

01:50:55.670 --> 01:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
kiers
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
fund transfer that really wasn't
 
01:51:01.269 --> 01:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
recognizable as of june 30th 21.
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
and that was approximately 10 million
 
01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:05.030 align:start position:0%
and that was approximately 10 million
dollars

01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:51:06.230 --> 01:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and those are the required
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
communications that we need to go
 
01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.630 align:start position:0%
communications that we need to go
through

01:51:08.630 --> 01:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
i would just say that if anybody has
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
who who else funds
 
01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.429 align:start position:0%
who who else funds
i

01:51:25.429 --> 01:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
i would if it's all right i would just
 
01:51:32.469 --> 01:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
like to add that the i want to thank my
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
staff obviously and kpmg for another
 
01:51:38.309 --> 01:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
successful audit 100 remote again for
 
01:51:41.190 --> 01:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
the second time ever um my staff's in
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
the office but kpmg folks are remote so
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
it was um it was another smooth audit
 
01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
and as well uh thank you lba for their
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
help because they provide a lot of the
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
staffing assistance so we work well
 
01:51:54.469 --> 01:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
together as a team
 
01:51:57.190 --> 01:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
um i can take a few minutes to
 
01:51:58.710 --> 01:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
highlight a few things in the book if
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's interest
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
just a couple
 
01:52:06.469 --> 01:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh just a couple just a couple
 
01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no okay
 
01:52:10.389 --> 01:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
so again it's 160 page book there's a
 
01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
lot of uh work involved but i'll bring
 
01:52:14.230 --> 01:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
up a couple of the areas we tend to
 
01:52:17.190 --> 01:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
discuss the most is page 8
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
is where you'll find the general and
 
01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
is where you'll find the general and
education

01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund surplus statements
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is not an audit document so that's
 
01:52:27.269 --> 01:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
purely on
 
01:52:29.190 --> 01:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i to prepare
 
01:52:31.110 --> 01:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
but it does align with our audited
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
financial statements so
 
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
you will see that it reflects a very
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
healthy year in unrestricted revenue and
 
01:52:40.389 --> 01:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
a very healthy rainy day fund balance
 
01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
that is now up to
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
257.8 million dollars so that is where
 
01:52:46.309 --> 01:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
we ended the year
 
01:52:49.110 --> 01:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
um that means because it's the end of uh
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
the biennium the general fund does not
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
carry over any unrestricted undesignated
 
01:52:55.429 --> 01:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
fund surplus that is now all in the
 
01:52:58.309 --> 01:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund per statute so
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we start anew going into fy 22 but
 
01:53:03.269 --> 01:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
halfway through the year we're already
 
01:53:05.190 --> 01:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
in good shape so
 
01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah and then if there are no
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
questions on that i would turn you to
 
01:53:13.590 --> 01:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
page 28 and 29 is our primary financial
 
01:53:16.469 --> 01:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
statement where you see the items that
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlington has discussed in
 
01:53:19.429 --> 01:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
terms of opeb
 
01:53:19.439 --> 01:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
terms of opeb
pension

01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
pension
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
debt all of our long-term
 
01:53:25.269 --> 01:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is our balance sheet
 
01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is our long-term
 
01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
assets and liabilities
 
01:53:31.429 --> 01:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
nothing really has changed since last
 
01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
year so that's good news
 
01:53:35.670 --> 01:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
and then lastly i would turn you to the
 
01:53:38.309 --> 01:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
general fund statements which is on page
 
01:53:38.319 --> 01:53:40.070 align:start position:0%
general fund statements which is on page
33.

01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
33.
 
01:53:42.389 --> 01:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
general education highway and the
 
01:53:44.230 --> 01:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund are reflected
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
here and their fund balances are here
 
01:53:48.630 --> 01:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
which is similar to what you would see
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the surplus statement
 
01:53:53.349 --> 01:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
but this is gap-based and
 
01:53:54.469 --> 01:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
one thing i would point out the
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund we typically
 
01:53:59.190 --> 01:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't put federal funds into their own
 
01:54:01.269 --> 01:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
column federal funds which we've
 
01:54:03.349 --> 01:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
received you know for years and will
 
01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
continue to receive for years run its
 
01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
course through the general fund um but
 
01:54:11.349 --> 01:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
with when the chrono for iris relief
 
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
fund came along the 1.25 billion that
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state received we thought it was
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
warranted to be highlighted
 
01:54:22.230 --> 01:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
um unbeknownst to us we've now continued
 
01:54:24.389 --> 01:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
to receive the same level of funding in
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the arpa fund so um we will be
 
01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
we'll be this column will have an end
 
01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
life to it
 
01:54:33.269 --> 01:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
and then we will continue our past
 
01:54:35.429 --> 01:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
practice of
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
having the federal funds shown through
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
the general fund reporting um but that
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:54:44.230 --> 01:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
variety of other places where arpa funds
 
01:54:46.710 --> 01:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
are reported including our transparency
 
01:54:48.710 --> 01:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
website so we'll be talking about that
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
more in the in the next audit
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.269 --> 01:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
represent edwards
 
01:55:00.389 --> 01:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's been two years maybe
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's been three
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
boys and means used to have somebody
 
01:55:09.190 --> 01:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
from the state a very senior guy he's
 
01:55:12.389 --> 01:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
retired and been re replaced but but one
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
of the things he would uh talk to ways
 
01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
and means about is how the financial
 
01:55:21.190 --> 01:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
analysts were viewing new hampshire's
 
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.150 align:start position:0%
analysts were viewing new hampshire's
books

01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:55:25.349 --> 01:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
and particularly the rainy day fund
 
01:55:26.710 --> 01:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
and how that
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
could potentially influence our bond
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
rating and so i'm
 
01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
has this 257 million dollar rainy day
 
01:55:38.710 --> 01:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
fund has that had any influence uh with
 
01:55:42.389 --> 01:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
the analysts to either raise or maintain
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
our bond rating and remind us what the
 
01:55:46.150 --> 01:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
bond rating is
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh i couldn't well actually i probably
 
01:55:50.309 --> 01:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
could find it in there but um our
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
department of treasury so monica
 
01:55:54.389 --> 01:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
mezapelli is in charge of the bond
 
01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
issuances and what i can tell you is
 
01:55:58.389 --> 01:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we are issuing
 
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
starting that process this month
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
so in the next couple of months they'll
 
01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
be issuing bonds and going through the
 
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
rating agency process
 
01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:07.429 align:start position:0%
rating agency process
so

01:56:07.429 --> 01:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
stay tuned i guess is the short answer
 
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
because we will find out if that had any
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
implication on our um current bond
 
01:56:17.349 --> 01:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
rating which i think is a
 
01:56:17.359 --> 01:56:18.230 align:start position:0%
rating which i think is a
a

01:56:18.230 --> 01:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:19.269 --> 01:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
i'll let back
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
each agency has a different rating
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
system our bond rating is not the
 
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
absolute highest but it's close it's not
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
been lowered in a long time it was
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
lowered at one time because the rainy
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
day fund went through significant
 
01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.150 align:start position:0%
day fund went through significant
depletion

01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
depletion
 
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the state's balances in general in a
 
01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
of the state's balances in general in a
period

01:56:39.590 --> 01:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
running through the last recession
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund has never ever been
 
01:56:45.190 --> 01:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
this high
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and that will lead to very good
 
01:56:49.590 --> 01:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
things for the bond rating i i don't
 
01:56:51.349 --> 01:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
want to predict and i don't think monica
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
would predict
 
01:56:55.349 --> 01:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
that they will go up
 
01:56:57.429 --> 01:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
but bond rating agencies will go that's
 
01:56:57.439 --> 01:56:59.030 align:start position:0%
but bond rating agencies will go that's
great

01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:57:04.630 --> 01:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.190 --> 01:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's hard not to it's i mean it's it's
 
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:09.269 align:start position:0%
it's hard not to it's i mean it's it's
astonishingly

01:57:09.269 --> 01:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
astonishingly
 
01:57:10.389 --> 01:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
i'm going to look at senator
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro and i probably he doesn't
 
01:57:14.630 --> 01:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
even remember it being this high ever
 
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:15.429 align:start position:0%
even remember it being this high ever
yeah

01:57:15.429 --> 01:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way we're making
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
giant progress in
 
01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.030 align:start position:0%
giant progress in
2022

01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
fy2022 thank you to steve he found it on
 
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
page 26. it's a triple a double a plus
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
for uh fitch
 
01:57:38.150 --> 01:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative emerick yes thank you
 
01:57:41.110 --> 01:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:57:43.269 --> 01:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
one of when you talked about the arpa
 
01:57:45.349 --> 01:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
funds and
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
one called the governor's office of
 
01:57:51.110 --> 01:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
emergency relief and recovery is that is
 
01:57:53.269 --> 01:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
that under this umbrella or is that
 
01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
being accounted for somewhere else
 
01:57:58.230 --> 01:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
so the governor's office uh the gopher
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
office uh
 
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.550 align:start position:0%
office uh
is

01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
reflected they're managing the funds in
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus relief fund column so
 
01:58:07.590 --> 01:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
the original 1.25 billion that we
 
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
received is being managed by that group
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:58:14.469 --> 01:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
winding down so as of the end of uh
 
01:58:19.269 --> 01:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
calendar 21 we were supposed to have
 
01:58:21.429 --> 01:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
encumbered all of that funding so it'll
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
take us some time to trickle out
 
01:58:26.630 --> 01:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
the all of the other funding is
 
01:58:29.269 --> 01:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's why it's different in that at the
 
01:58:31.269 --> 01:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
time we were working under emergency
 
01:58:34.469 --> 01:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
orders so the funding and the acceptance
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the funds and the spending of the
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
fund was going through an entirely
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
different process the arpa funds are all
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
going through the normal this process
 
01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
so anything that's being added to the
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
budget is coming through this the normal
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism um which is you folks
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
and that is all
 
01:58:54.309 --> 01:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
going to be accounted for within the
 
01:58:57.269 --> 01:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
agencies that received the fund
 
01:58:59.670 --> 01:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
so if health and human services receives
 
01:59:01.349 --> 01:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
that federal grant it comes through
 
01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
their portion of the general fund if
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
environmental services receives funding
 
01:59:07.269 --> 01:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
it comes through their portion of the
 
01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
general fund so it will be reflected it
 
01:59:12.309 --> 01:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
will just make our base numbers that
 
01:59:15.349 --> 01:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
much higher but it's not
 
01:59:17.269 --> 01:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
some of it may
 
01:59:20.309 --> 01:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
be managed by the gopher office but it
 
01:59:22.710 --> 01:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
will still fall in line with whatever
 
01:59:24.469 --> 01:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
category of government is spending those
 
01:59:24.479 --> 01:59:30.389 align:start position:0%
category of government is spending those
funds

01:59:30.389 --> 01:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.670 --> 01:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner did you want to add
 
01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.790 align:start position:0%
commissioner did you want to add
anything

01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
senator guida did you have a question
 
01:59:43.110 --> 01:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
in that we're discussing arpa and kara's
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
act funds and such
 
01:59:49.349 --> 01:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to seek support from this
 
01:59:49.359 --> 01:59:50.710 align:start position:0%
i would like to seek support from this
body

01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:59:53.190 --> 01:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
to require gopher to re report to the
 
01:59:55.190 --> 01:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the aggregate and specifically how
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
much money has been received how much
 
02:00:01.190 --> 02:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
money has been granted and how much
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
money has been spent
 
02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
both for cares and and arpa
 
02:00:07.590 --> 02:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money a lot of it is
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
going out fast in places and so forth i
 
02:00:11.269 --> 02:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
think it would help me and i would hope
 
02:00:12.469 --> 02:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
that some other member of the committee
 
02:00:15.349 --> 02:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
would second my motion uh to uh to ask
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
gopher to provide
 
02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
such an analysis so with the permission
 
02:00:21.190 --> 02:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
of the chair i'll move
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%

02:02:41.110 --> 02:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work on the on the part of
 
02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.389 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work on the on the part of
das

02:02:42.389 --> 02:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
das
 
02:02:42.399 --> 02:02:43.349 align:start position:0%
das
and

02:02:43.349 --> 02:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
of course we love it when we receive a
 
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.910 align:start position:0%
of course we love it when we receive a
uh

02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:49.269 --> 02:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
what was it called
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
audit excellence
 
02:02:53.429 --> 02:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
clean opinion is the generic term we use
 
02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
oh no no that the certificate that goes
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes we we submit the financial
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
statements to the gfoa for an award
 
02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
every year and we did receive it again
 
02:03:05.670 --> 02:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
yes and that that's
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
very good so i thank you all if you'd
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
like to continue or listen to our
 
02:03:11.590 --> 02:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
discussion you're more than welcome to
 
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.550 align:start position:0%
discussion you're more than welcome to
stay

02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
stay
 
02:03:14.309 --> 02:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.190 --> 02:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry to
 
02:03:26.469 --> 02:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
interrupt that but uh
 
02:03:29.269 --> 02:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
i thought we should get back to
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think i think i
 
02:03:33.110 --> 02:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
heard the answer to be
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
that um it's not clear
 
02:03:38.469 --> 02:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
whether we should be expecting it or
 
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.950 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
yes

02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
does the change in motion
 
02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
does the change in motion
preclude

02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
preclude
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
preclude the
 
02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:57.429 align:start position:0%
preclude the
presenters

02:03:57.429 --> 02:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
presenters
 
02:04:00.150 --> 02:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
from having available an electronic or
 
02:04:02.389 --> 02:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
paper copy
 
02:04:02.399 --> 02:04:04.150 align:start position:0%
paper copy
of

02:04:04.150 --> 02:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
the information that that senator geider
 
02:04:08.389 --> 02:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
has asked for
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
because i that's what i heard in the
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
original motion was that we would have
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of document that we'd be used
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
to referral
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that now has been changed to a verbal
 
02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
02:04:21.349 --> 02:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
like to also ensure that there was some
 
02:04:23.590 --> 02:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
something electronic or
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
in paper that we'd be able to refer to
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
my goal was just simply to
 
02:04:32.309 --> 02:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
enhance the motion
 
02:04:34.150 --> 02:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
to add
 
02:04:36.469 --> 02:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
a presentation
 
02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
it was not to eliminate the
 
02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.550 align:start position:0%
it was not to eliminate the
the

02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
the
spreadsheet

02:04:44.230 --> 02:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.110 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
so

02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:46.469 --> 02:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
safe to say
 
02:04:48.389 --> 02:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
by consensus of the body that a
 
02:04:50.309 --> 02:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet will be provided in addition
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
to a presentation
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's right of that motion yes and that
 
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
it be electronic
 
02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
it be electronic
well

02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:04:59.590 --> 02:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
more than likely it can be both but
 
02:05:04.150 --> 02:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's because you have your little
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
computer sitting there which is totally
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
against the rules
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay it's in a public hearing
 
02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:12.970 align:start position:0%
okay it's in a public hearing
oh

02:05:12.970 --> 02:05:12.980 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:16.469 align:start position:0%
oh
[Music]

02:05:16.469 --> 02:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.479 --> 02:05:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
02:05:22.389 --> 02:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh michael
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
do you have a feel
 
02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.269 align:start position:0%
do you have a feel
for

02:05:27.269 --> 02:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:05:32.469 --> 02:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.150 --> 02:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.150 --> 02:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
so i know that gopher
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
has a lot of information on their
 
02:05:48.469 --> 02:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
website the problem it's not in a uh a
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
summary format that
 
02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
i believe will be very helpful for the
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
legislature so for instance cares you
 
02:05:58.630 --> 02:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
have 1.25 they have a high level summary
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
by program type of where it went but how
 
02:06:03.349 --> 02:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
much has been expended how much i think
 
02:06:04.630 --> 02:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's something the community has so we
 
02:06:07.110 --> 02:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
can relay that to the commissioner
 
02:06:10.469 --> 02:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh as far as uh our funds are involved
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
um they did put out a new report gopher
 
02:06:14.389 --> 02:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
on their website
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
i just noticed it today
 
02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
just kind of breakdown of all the fiscal
 
02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
approvals of the arpa there's about 958
 
02:06:23.269 --> 02:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
million of flex funds uh black for
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
better term about 400 million has been
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
spent and they have it down to a certain
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
category level i'll send that to the
 
02:06:32.070 --> 02:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee um obviously i don't believe
 
02:06:33.190 --> 02:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
gopher would be ready to go for your
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
january 21st meeting plus i think you
 
02:06:36.469 --> 02:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
have your binders in your office right
 
02:06:36.479 --> 02:06:37.349 align:start position:0%
have your binders in your office right
now

02:06:37.349 --> 02:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
but i will send you kind of what they
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
have now and wait for feedback from you
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then communicate this with taylor
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
and taylor caswell and gopher
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
to get a report that's going to be
 
02:06:51.349 --> 02:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
helpful so you can see where that money
 
02:06:51.359 --> 02:06:52.790 align:start position:0%
helpful so you can see where that money
went

02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
went
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
i know they keep track of it
 
02:06:56.710 --> 02:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
there's so much money coming in i think
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
you have to keep track of it is audited
 
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
um it's just the reporting part of it
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
let me pull i'll pull together some
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
links from gopher that i think may get
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
you closer to where you want to go and
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
then i'll wait for your feedback and
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'll include everyone and share that
 
02:07:14.309 --> 02:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
with taylor caswell so you get a report
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
and a presentation is what you're
 
02:07:18.070 --> 02:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking for i think there's
 
02:07:20.469 --> 02:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of information sometimes it's too
 
02:07:22.309 --> 02:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
much information nothing against gopher
 
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
but if you go to the gopher site there
 
02:07:26.230 --> 02:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
the time that you have to spend on that
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
will try to um
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.230 --> 02:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh any more discussion
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none um
 
02:07:41.269 --> 02:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
do i have to do a roll call
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
no okay all those in favor please raise
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.389 --> 02:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
oppose none
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
