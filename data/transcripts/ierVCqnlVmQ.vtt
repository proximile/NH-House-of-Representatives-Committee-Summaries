00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:16.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.479 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
all right fabulous
 
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.870 align:start position:0%
all right fabulous
i

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
under the belief that representative
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
rhodes is in florida still with her
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
mother so
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
in attendance today
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
so i'll open the subcommittee meeting on
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1079
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
and just to remind the folks what this
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
basically is
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
is it's looking to adjust the amount of
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
part-time hours that a retired member
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
can work in the system
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
or that's in the group 2 system
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
and make adjustments forward with that
 
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.309 align:start position:0%
and make adjustments forward with that
in

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
to give you an idea of what 16 16 164
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
hours looks like that equates to 32
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
hours a week
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
the current statute of 13 thank you 1352
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
to cover what rsa 100 a7b means that is
 
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.469 align:start position:0%
to cover what rsa 100 a7b means that is
working

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
working
under

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
a declared emergency
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that's already that's already in
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
statute but that
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
in the event of catastrophe exempts
 
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:48.870 align:start position:0%
in the event of catastrophe exempts
um

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
those hours from from even becoming a
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll be happy to
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes my feeling is that
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
we changed this
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
relatively recently
 
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.430 align:start position:0%
relatively recently
and

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
we haven't really heard
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
major problems from it as long as the
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
allowance is there for
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
cases of emergency i don't feel that it
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed back at this time
 
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed back at this time
okay

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing too that i'll point out
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know because we
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
being cognizant of what's going on in
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
the seacoast and hampton beach certainly
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
becomes the largest town in the state
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know in the summer especially on a
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
weekend you know looking at that that
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
total number of hours
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
hiring someone for the limited summer
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we have in new hampshire here
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
equates to 640 hours
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
so we're not even in the ballpark of
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
concern in reference to part you know if
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
hampton was awry or uh seabrook was in
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know need of hiring part-time police
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
officers to handle beach
 
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:13.190 align:start position:0%
officers to handle beach
season

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
season
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're not even remotely close to to
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
having an issue with those hours at 6
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
40. so that i just wanted to
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
throw that out there as i'm you know as
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're kind of putting a reality to what
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i too would agree
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
that uh what we have in place now is
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
you look around at other states and
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
there are other states out there that
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't allow
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
retired workers to even come back and
 
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
retired workers to even come back and
work

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.949 align:start position:0%
work
we've

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
met a balance
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
with the separation from employment 28
 
00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:13.590 align:start position:0%
with the separation from employment 28
days

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
we allowed four
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
police officers to maintain their
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
training and their certification in
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
those 28 days
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that they can come back
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know we we've talked about this
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
numerous times and if anything you know
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
the number of hours could actually even
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
be reduced
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
when you're retired
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
you retire not to retire to come back to
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
work in the same position you were
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
and in these cases they can come back
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
they could retire and
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
someone could retire if we get rid of
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill if we left
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
past this bill right now that's here
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
you have individuals that could retire
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
in april
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
and still work full-time
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.629 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
the summer months collecting a full
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
pension and working full-time and i have
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
an issue with that
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's also been brought to our attention
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the reference to those that that are
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the teachers in group one that this
 
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
in the teachers in group one that this
would

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
exceed their actual full-time hours so
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
in essence you could have a teacher
 
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
in essence you could have a teacher
retire

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
retire
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
and just continue to work full-time
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
under under this
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
almost under the current numbers
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely when we go beyond that to
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
over 1600
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern and why i say you
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
know if anything i'd
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
would be for reducing the hours
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
so the other concern that i that i have
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
again in
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
in discussion here um is twofold one of
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
that involves
 
00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:54.389 align:start position:0%
that involves
the

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
income stream to the pension system
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
we've made a lot of changes over the
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
years that have
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
been done down to the guise of reducing
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
benefits but it's also
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
shut off an income stream and where the
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system relies on investment
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
returns to function
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful as to how many of
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
these income streams we shut off
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern with what the
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
quote unquote decertification
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
problem in the sense that an agency can
 
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.190 align:start position:0%
problem in the sense that an agency can
eliminate

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
a full-time position that pays into the
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
not only is there an issue in reference
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
to their debt
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
as assigned to that position but also it
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
shuts the income stream off completely
 
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
shuts the income stream off completely
and

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
because we do heavily rely well not
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
heavily right now it's an e it's about
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
what 85 15 i think 85 percent of the
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
members contributions covers
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
the payouts and we re we rely on about
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
15 percent of investment returns
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to see that number
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
start to change
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
certainly that that's in it you know it
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
would it would be great frankly if it
 
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.710 align:start position:0%
would it would be great frankly if it
was

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we didn't have to rely on
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
investment returns at all but that's
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
just not reality so
 
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.230 align:start position:0%
just not reality so
um

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
so there's there's you know that is a
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
function in this and the other thing too
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
before i get to you mark is um
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
you know we in 2010 there was a you know
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of looking at the
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
concept of double dipping and we had
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
some some examples in the state of new
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire where that was occurring you
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
know and this
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
really doesn't this goes in the other
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
direction when it comes to the concept
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
of double dipping and that's
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
both structurally and in the sense of
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
public perception has been something
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's not really gone so well so
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
you know i think that we have to be
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
careful here
 
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.150 align:start position:0%
careful here
um

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
bringing back something that literally
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
goes against what we fought for in the
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
cases of double dipping representative
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
this one is a tough one i see problems
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
on both sides of this issue all around
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
i understand the
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
on the one side unless i'm thinking
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
confusing this with another bill and i
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
don't think i am
 
00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
don't think i am
um

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the one side you've got the issue of
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
people retiring but then
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
not ideal and it makes for um
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
makes for problems with personal
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
relationships and and
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
the possibilities of corruption
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
if a person has worked x number of years
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
fully vested in their pension and
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
and is beginning to receive that pension
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
well that they've worked for and they've
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
already paid into it so it's theirs and
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
what they do beyond that
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
is really no business of anyone's
 
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.470 align:start position:0%
is really no business of anyone's
frankly

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
on the other side the the i see the
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
problem of um
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know streams of income for the
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:09.670 align:start position:0%
pension system
but

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
the flip side of that to me is
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
again they've already paid in their
 
00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
again they've already paid in their
pension

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
so what their working
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
situation is beyond that i mean they're
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
not sucking money out of the pension
 
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.829 align:start position:0%
not sucking money out of the pension
system

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh that they haven't already paid
 
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh that they haven't already paid
into

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
although i do understand like you say it
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
represents a decrease in income
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the pension system
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
on the other hand uh
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
not getting more money isn't the same as
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
losing money so i'm i'm
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
have a completely open mind on this and
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'd love to uh be convinced one way the
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
other not easy
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
sure one one of the things that is
 
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.470 align:start position:0%
sure one one of the things that is
healthy

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
and this is some you know i get some
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
people that just that have a hard time
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
with this concept
 
00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
with this concept
but

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
the it's better for the pension system
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
for an employee to work longer
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
right because they're paying rather than
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
collecting and even though that gives
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
them a larger pension as they move
 
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.270 align:start position:0%
them a larger pension as they move
forward

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
overall for the system it would it's
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
better for employees to work longer
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why the change
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
in 2010
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
changed the minimum amount of years from
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
20 to 25 because it was it was just
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
overall it was healthier for the system
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
it wasn't necessarily healthier for the
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
employee but it was healthier for the
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
system so
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things where i
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
we've we've also we've done two things
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
here you know let's also not forget
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
that when this was enacted there were
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 2 000 employees that were
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
grandfathered as well
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
and they're so they all they're still
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
all out there those folks are still
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
can still function with absolutely no
 
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
can still function with absolutely no
limit

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know and that's of course they will
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
attrition will get you know we'll remove
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
them over time but
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
um that's it's going to take a long time
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
for those 2 000 grandfathered retirees
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
in essence to die i guess i mean that's
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
really how you that's the only way you
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
attrition out of the pension system so
 
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
attrition out of the pension system so
um

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah i don't think that you know i
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a compelling argument
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
really as to as to why this increase is
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
necessary other than
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
some communities just don't want to
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
annie up the money to to hire
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
the full-time people that they need so
 
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.390 align:start position:0%
the full-time people that they need so
um

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
i mean that's i think we're kind of all
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the same page with that
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
we also saw mr chair
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
that there were some cities and towns
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
that were going away from full-time
 
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
that were going away from full-time
positions

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
creating part-time positions and when
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
they walk away from the unfunded accrued
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
liability portion by doing that and what
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
that does is spread that out amongst all
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
the other communities in the state
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
so when you when you
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
remove a position from
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
a full-time paying into the system
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
position and you make it a create a
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
part-time position you've also walked
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
away from that unfunded accrued
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
liability payment on that position as
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
well so that's one of the other issues
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
we had and that just goes back onto
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
other cities and towns picking up that
 
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.630 align:start position:0%
other cities and towns picking up that
rate

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
it you know and i think until we until
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
we really address
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
how that's dealt with
 
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.669 align:start position:0%
how that's dealt with
specifically

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i think we need to be cautious here
 
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.549 align:start position:0%
i i think we need to be cautious here
about

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
further adjustments
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
because as of right now statutorily
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
it's not well addressed
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
as to how that's dealt with and i think
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that's something that
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
there needs to be legislation in the
 
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.710 align:start position:0%
there needs to be legislation in the
fall

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
not not that i'm encouraging the
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
creation of another commission or
 
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.789 align:start position:0%
creation of another commission or
committee

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
but i think that we there needs to be a
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
look at what we need to do statutorily
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
to say to a community know if you've got
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you've got five million
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of pension debt you can't
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
walk away from it by simply just making
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
all your people part-time that's not
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
fair to the other communities so
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
so i think that that that really
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
warrants um
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
a deep dive before we start
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
well you know i guess the
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
it would really come down to if
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative allegro has any
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
other questions or concerns in this
 
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:42.230 align:start position:0%
other questions or concerns in this
matter

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just having a problem sorting out
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
the greater of two evils but it seems
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the committee or
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i should say
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
um is of one mind
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not three to one i think it's uh
 
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
so it's not three to one i think it's uh
301

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
301
 
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
301
uh

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
and i yeah i don't have any questions i
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
i may the question is not whether the
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
retiree should pay into the retirement
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
system on the hours worked nobody
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
believes that should happen the question
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
is should the employer pay into the
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system to cover the accrued
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
liability of the position that is now
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
to be are they to be paying
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
once he's retired we want the town to
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
consider its obligations
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
and a number of towns and school
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
districts have told me that they
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
specifically hired
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
retirees so they wouldn't have to pay
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
the pension contribution on those on
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
no doubt it's just that you know
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
basically in this particular piece of
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
legislation there's no that's not being
 
00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:08.230 align:start position:0%
legislation there's no that's not being
addressed

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
at all it's this is simply just asking
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
do we adjust the hours in a calendar
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know there would there could
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
certainly be some discussion as to
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
whether this is amended to to start
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
talking about the specifics of that but
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
i mean do we have to get a ruling if if
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is going on beyond the original
 
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.230 align:start position:0%
this is going on beyond the original
intent

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
as far as it being germain or not and
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
and again i don't you know the the
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative that filed this
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative trottier
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't really in his address did not
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
really touch upon that at all it was
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
really just a matter of
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i agree that would that would be a
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
complete uh
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
tangent off of what the intent of this
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill is so you know again looking at
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
1079 as it exists
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know it's basically a matter of what
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
is does this committee agree that the
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
number of hours should go up and i and
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that they do not so
 
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.710 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that they do not so
um

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
i think we should leave this as it is
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
it's only been changed it's only it's
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
not even five years old that these hours
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
have been changed so i think that you
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
know i think a little bit more time
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
needs to happen here to look and see
 
00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:32.470 align:start position:0%
needs to happen here to look and see
um

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know what that translates to and
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
and also too keep in mind and i want to
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
be clear here this is not
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
this is not a limit on the number of
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
hours an agency can do this is a limit
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
on hours of a specific retired employee
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
so this is not handcuffing a
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know a department from hiring two or
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
three part-time people
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's just there's there's no prohibition
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
there it's just a matter of per employee
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
so i want to make sure that
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that's understood we're not we're
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
not harming
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know a a police department
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
that has a need here they just they're
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
just gonna have to do it with more than
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so unless they're
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
limited by the number of potential
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
employees available under those
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances they could be limited
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
but if there's an abundance of employees
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
that want to come back part-time they're
 
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.149 align:start position:0%
that want to come back part-time they're
okay

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative goalie and just one
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
last thing as we talk about the hours um
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
we saw in
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
the executive orders from the governor
 
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.230 align:start position:0%
the executive orders from the governor
he

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
exempted them
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
from the number of hours they could work
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
during the cover relief in one of his
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
executive orders so it does work in a
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
time of emergency when these officers or
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters or anybody are needed in
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
so it can be done
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
all right very good
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was a concern of mine also the
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
the fact of taking out that language for
 
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.909 align:start position:0%
the fact of taking out that language for
the

00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
28 days
 
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.710 align:start position:0%
28 days
and

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
we do understand that there are
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
emergency situations that need to be
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
covered and i think
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't really
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
help either of those situations so
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll just remind the committee one
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
more time rsa 100 a7b
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
is the one that allows
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
working under a declared emergency the
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the limits just that don't apply so
 
00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.230 align:start position:0%
the limits just that don't apply so
that's

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's already in statute that
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is irrespective to what happens
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
so cool i think uh so if there's
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
anything more i think the committee
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
the committee has made it pretty clear
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
that they're not in favor of this
 
00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:03.190 align:start position:0%
that they're not in favor of this
so

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
all right i'll close the the
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing on 1079 and
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
hand the room over to
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis who's got a 930
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee mr chad do you need a
 
00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:15.029 align:start position:0%
subcommittee mr chad do you need a
motion

00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
if you'd like a formal motion we can
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
form a motion uh itl sure
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
is that you making the motion no i
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
believe that's me putting words in your
 
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.190 align:start position:0%
believe that's me putting words in your
mouth

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly in favor of that as
 
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.870 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly in favor of that as
well

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that this is not
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
an official vote right so it's a
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommendation yeah i can
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
abstain right now and think it over
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
all right we've got a few minutes i'll
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
wait until the official starting time to
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
let me be necessary
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
youtube because the subcommittee is
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
recording now they know okay that's why
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to be in their seat
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
instead of us
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
halloween yeah okay
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
actually

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
carol thank you
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think we have to sit at our seats he
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
was saying because they are
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
recording these and
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't be sorry i'd prefer it
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
that way but
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.909 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah for valentine's day we don't go out
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
because the restaurants are crazy i'll
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
pick up
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i guess representative rhodes is uh
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
still in florida helping her mom with
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
i was wondering that as well um
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
but i guess her mom broke her hip
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and representative marsh
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
so far unless somebody shows up at the
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it is 9 30 so i'm going to open the
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on house bill
 
00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:48.630 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on house bill
1192.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
1192.
 
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.269 align:start position:0%
1192.
um

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
so the senate has a bill senate bill 282
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
which they've amended
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
and passed on the consent calendar
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
which does i think everything we want
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
i mean i've got a few copies of it in
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
case somebody wants to see it as amended
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
by the senate but
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to come to us anyway
 
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
it's going to come to us anyway
so

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is to recommend that we
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
just hold on to 1192
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
until we get senate bill 282
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
and then um we can decide what to do
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
which will probably be
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know i would say probably to
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
review and and go go along probably with
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
282 and then it'll 1192 but we can wait
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
the issue is we won't get senate bill
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
282 until after crossover and we have to
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
do something with this house bill 1192
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
prior to crossover
 
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.350 align:start position:0%
prior to crossover
um

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know actually
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
carol go out walk out anyway um bills
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
will be coming over over time they don't
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
all happen at crossover and since
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
they've already acted on the bill we're
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably going to see it before
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
crossover maybe
 
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.350 align:start position:0%
crossover maybe
maybe

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
in any event my recommendation is we
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
either send 1192 to interim study or we
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
adopt my amendment 0 3 6 8 h which would
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
make 1192 identical to senate bill 282
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
and and then the question becomes smooth
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
right i talked to chair mcguire and she
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't happy with the idea of having two
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
identical bills one house one senate
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't i mean if you look at in
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
january we had a whole pile of um
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
on consent of itl bills that were there
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
because the other body had done
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
already done it or other similar reasons
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to decide that right
 
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to decide that right
now

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
if we recommend holding on to it we can
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
decide that later any other thoughts
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
i agree with what you're saying i think
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
we just hang on to it and when we get
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 282 if it is what we want
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
we use that but
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can ask the the clerk
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
where senate bill 282 stands but
 
00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.630 align:start position:0%
where senate bill 282 stands but
um

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
i don't think that i think we'll get it
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
before crossover
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
yeah as i recall from last year we the
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
bills were uh
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
senate bills were coming in well before
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
crossover so
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
but again i mean if we come down to the
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
deadline where we have to act on it we
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
can do something with it but
 
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.149 align:start position:0%
can do something with it but
okay

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that so we just recommend
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
doing nothing for right now okay if we
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
have a consensus on that then i close
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on house bill
 
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.110 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on house bill
1192

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
1192
 
00:33:37.120 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
1192
okay

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
which is always a good sign
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
and they said they're completely
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
satisfied with what the senate did oh
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
well that's cool then
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's even easier if they're happy
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
feedback

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
schmidt

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.920 --> 01:00:39.030 align:start position:0%

through the bill and that's where i
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
introduced the amendment and it needs to
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
go to the whole committee and have a
 
01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:30.789 align:start position:0%

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative goalie
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
if this is a public hearing on an orange
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
main amendment i'm just curious as to if
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
he should be over here with a pink card
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
filled in or how does this work
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
is my question if it's a no injuring
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it's
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an amendment
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
we i mean if you want we can have him in
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
the hot seat
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.549 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
if yeah the microphone's very necessary
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
so if that's not going to work
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
we are so that
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
see if we can figure it get somebody
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
if if we can't drag a microphone over
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
there we may have to
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
wiggle things around a little bit
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
now it works
 
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.190 align:start position:0%

01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
really have a place to work outside of
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.990 align:start position:0%

is is is 328i
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that the section that covers medical
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
technicians precisely yes since it's
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
been repealed elsewhere references
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.870 align:start position:0%
no it makes sense 328 it is it is the
chapter

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
a number of times in testimony
 
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.349 align:start position:0%
a number of times in testimony
that

01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
we were the only state that does this
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm hearing conflicting information
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
i've heard
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
there may be 11 states out there
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
that either register
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
do you know if their new hampshire is
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
truly the only state doing this or are
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
in my belief new hampshire is the only
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
state but
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%

mr chair
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent goalie could we have
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
our researcher look into that
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
information saying this isn't a timely
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have a little bit of time to get that
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
the chair calls senator sherman
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
did i see senator sherman
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
he's not here yet he asked me to put in
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
the card because he's under time
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
constraints then we will switch over to
 
01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:54.709 align:start position:0%
constraints then we will switch over to
miss

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
miss

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
representing our member hospitals are
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
supportive of the original bill as
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
introduced house bill 1330 which would
 
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
introduced house bill 1330 which would
change

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
the board to an advisory
 
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
the board to an advisory
capacity

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why we believe that the med
 
01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
the reason why we believe that the med
tech

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
tech
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
registry is important is because
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i think this is something that
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
senator sherman will address
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
is that we had a very serious situation
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
in our state with a
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
cath lab technician that
 
01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
cath lab technician that
stole

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
stole
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
opioids for his own use
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
and impacted
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
the access to care for patients as well
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
as infecting
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
many patients with hepatitis b
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
those are very serious patient safety
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
issues which is one of the reasons why
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
this med tech board was created to begin
 
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.110 align:start position:0%
this med tech board was created to begin
with

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are several types of positions
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
covered under the medtech registry and
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
again i just want to also clarify this
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
is a registry this is not a license so
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is just a list of professions that
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
are registered with oplc as being in
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
practice in new hampshire
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
that have access to opioids and patient
 
01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.189 align:start position:0%
that have access to opioids and patient
care

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
so the list for the record of those that
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
are part of the registry are anesthesia
 
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.270 align:start position:0%
are part of the registry are anesthesia

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to address a question that
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
represented goalie asked about other
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
states that may license
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
these types of positions i believe the
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
11 states do
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
laboratory technicians as licensed
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
lab techs do fall under new hampshire's
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
registry so we don't license them in new
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire we register them
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
so there are other
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
of these other positions that i
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned there could be other types of
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
registry certifications or licensures at
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
other states new hampshire took the
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
position of registering these types of
 
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
position of registering these types of
positions

01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
questions of the committee
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:08.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
allegro

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
allegro
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
the uh technician that kicked all of
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
this off by the theft of controlled
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
substances were they excuse me i want to
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
shift over so i can
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually see you as i'm speaking to you
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
were they not prosecuted for that theft
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up please so then there is a
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
powerful legal mechanism to deal with
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
do things like that then
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think the point of
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
of being a registered
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
position is that
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity for when you
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
hire someone if they have already been
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
registered if there was any
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
discipline against them in at least in
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire i think under
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
the original intent by senator sherman
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that he could be here
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
and speak to this he would love to see a
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
national registry of these types of
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
positions but felt like because there
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
was nothing in new hampshire we needed
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
to start somewhere so at least it's an
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a place for people to
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
file complaints and understand if
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
someone is in bad standing thank you
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
do you recall
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
how many deaths that
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
medical technician that was prosecuted
 
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
medical technician that was prosecuted
caused

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
caused
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
i don't recall that number off top of my
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
head there were some people some of the
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
patients that did
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
decease though is that correct correct
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and in other states
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
where this particular person had
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
practice thank you
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
kathy for taking my question
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like one of the key questions
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
here is whether other states in fact
 
01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.709 align:start position:0%
here is whether other states in fact
require

01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
registration or certification or
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
licensure or whatever of of these kinds
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
of people and i'm i'm looking right now
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
at the website of
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
the american society of surgical
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
technicians and while it looks like new
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire is the only state that
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
specifically requires registration only
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
of these technicians who are in contact
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
with opioid
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
who have access to opioids
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
it looks like they have a list of 12
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
states and i'd be glad to to read them
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
that require education and certification
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
of surgical technologists and an
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
additional three states require surgical
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
technologists to register in order to
 
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.270 align:start position:0%
technologists to register in order to
work

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
does that match your understanding yes
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
it seems to me a little strange like
 
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.550 align:start position:0%
it seems to me a little strange like
this

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
registration is called
 
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
registration is called
technicians

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
medical technicians but when you told us
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the list of people that were in there
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of them sounded like positions
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
other than what you might call
 
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.310 align:start position:0%
other than what you might call
technicians

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
technicians
so

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things i noticed just by
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
googling not that i know anything about
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals or medicine or anything like
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is that some states
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
have a registry
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
or a licensing process for people who
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
have access to
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if we're calling it
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
medical technician but really is it more
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
protect trying to identify people who
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
have access to controlled drugs yes that
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
is the intention of new hampshire's
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
registry is specifically for
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
health care professions that aren't
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise licensed for instance rns
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're not in this list but they have
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
access to controlled drugs but they're
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
already licensed by the board of nursing
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
so the list of positions that i
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
read off for you are those that aren't
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise licensed or certified by some
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the committee have a
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
question representative goalie
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:55.750 align:start position:0%
we hear
that

01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
licensing and registering
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
individuals and having boards
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
is for the best interests
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
and safety of the public
 
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.310 align:start position:0%
and safety of the public
and

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
deaths were related to some of the
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
things that went on in the previous
 
01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
things that went on in the previous
individual

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
would not registering these individuals
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
be in the best interest of public safety
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative lekis
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm just wondering if you happen to
 
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.709 align:start position:0%
um i'm just wondering if you happen to
know

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
if the the person you mentioned who
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
basically committed a number of crimes
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
if registration had been required would
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
he have been eligible for registration
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
because it appears
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
and let me know if i'm wrong
 
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.229 align:start position:0%
and let me know if i'm wrong
that

01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
the main thing would be if there was a
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
med tech registry had been in existence
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
when this individual was hired into new
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire he would have been required to
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
register in new hampshire
 
01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.350 align:start position:0%
register in new hampshire

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.790 align:start position:0%

follow-up
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
i understand the question was
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
was there anything
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
in his history when he started to work
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
that you know of that would have
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
prevented him from being registered
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
my what i'm getting to is you know would
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
the existence of this registry if it
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
existed before he was hired have
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
prevented him from being hired and and
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
then going on to do what he did
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know the specifics of the hiring
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
details but um
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
i see that senator sherman is here and
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
he had been intimately involved in that
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
situation he may be able to answer that
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question i imagine is a host
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
of federal
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
regulations when you're dealing with
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
controlled substances within the medical
 
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.870 align:start position:0%
controlled substances within the medical
community

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
community
and

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
other than the federal regulations and
 
01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
other than the federal regulations and
everything

01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
does this particular bill
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
enhance that and provide some proper
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
safeguards can you just go over that
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
does it add more than what is currently
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
under the federal regulation
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the bill before you which is an
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to house bill 1330 repeals the
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
board so it certainly takes away patient
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
safety considerations
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the original house bill 1330
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
changing it from
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
a board to an advisory capacity still
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
these members of the profession to be
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
registered and have oversight by oplc
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
the chair calls representative excuse me
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
senator sherman my
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak strongly against
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
the repeal of of the
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
board of registration although
 
01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:25.830 align:start position:0%
board of registration although
i

01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
as long as the same
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
as long as an advisory board
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
would have the same ability to register
 
01:20:33.199 --> 01:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
would have the same ability to register
technicians

01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
so in
 
01:20:41.679 --> 01:20:44.310 align:start position:0%
so in
2010

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
2010
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
i was asked to form a new gastrointest
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
gastroenterology group in new hampshire
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
in exeter their group had pulled out
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
with only about four to six months
 
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.229 align:start position:0%
with only about four to six months
notice

01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i was commuting to massachusetts so
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
they asked me if i would come and
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
start this i'd i'd run a 10 physician
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
practice in virginia before and um
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
so it was really exciting
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
and about a month after i started we
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
hired hillary tompkins who's one of the
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
best gastroenterologists i've ever
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
worked with and she's phenomenal she's
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
coming straight out of training
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're a fledgling group
 
01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
we're a fledgling group
in

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
2011 we started having cases of
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
acute hepatitis c
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
and in all my career
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'd never seen acute hepatitis c
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's a chronic illness typically people
 
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:37.580 align:start position:0%
who have had exposure to transfusions
 
01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:38.790 align:start position:0%
who have had exposure to transfusions
[Music]

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
needle sticks or um
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
and you know people like hemophiliacs or
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
people who were who had substance use
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
the treatment was incredibly difficult
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
at that point some of you may know that
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
we were using interferon and riboviron
 
01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
we were using interferon and riboviron
which

01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
can just have terrible side effects but
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
there were great new drugs in the
 
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
there were great new drugs in the
pipeline

01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
mass general had a study on these
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
one of the hillary and i were sitting
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
there literally at about 5 30 after we'd
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
finished seeing all our patients and
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're puzzling over two charts
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
they were both patients in their 80s
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know not your classic hepatitis c
 
01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.030 align:start position:0%
you know not your classic hepatitis c
patient

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.390 align:start position:0%
patient
and

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
neither of them had any risk factors for
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
hepatitis c
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we started going through the charts
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
together saying this is weird
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing to know about hepatitis
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
c is that you don't usually show
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
symptoms so
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
hepatitis b you typically will get
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
jaundice you know yellow skin yellow
 
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.790 align:start position:0%
jaundice you know yellow skin yellow
eyes

01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
eyes
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
yellow urine or dark colored urine but
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
not hepatitis c it's only a small
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
fraction of people who who will actually
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
manifest symptoms of hepatitis c
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
so these two elderly gentlemen
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
had acute hepatitis c by their blood
 
01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:58.470 align:start position:0%
had acute hepatitis c by their blood
work

01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
but they were also symptomatic and
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's what flagged us that there was
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
something going on in them and that's
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
why we did this this check
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
turned out the only thing that connected
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
these two gentlemen
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
was the cardiac catheterization lab
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
at exeter hospital
 
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:16.870 align:start position:0%
at exeter hospital
and

01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know the aha moment was a horrific
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
aha moment because the implications were
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
that if this was correct or if this were
 
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
that if this was correct or if this were
correct

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.669 align:start position:0%
correct
then

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
everybody going through the cath lab
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
was at risk
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
so we called the
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
hospital they notified the state
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
and many of you who were here in the
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
state back in 2011 2012 that's where the
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
hepatitis c outbreak first got its start
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
shortly after that working with the
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
hospital association and others we
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
started the statewide steering committee
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
which was an incredible group every
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
single stakeholder in the state
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
who was trying to we were devoted to
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that no one else was
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
impacted by drug diversion
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
the impact was enormous and this gets to
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative likus's
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
say your last name is lekka sorry
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative leckus's question
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
um in the state of michigan alone
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
the guy who was eventually found guilty
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
of this kotowski had gone to five
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
different hospitals in the state
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
they had no way to track him he was a
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
radiology tech
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
so what he would do is he would take
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
the anesthesia or sorry the cardiologist
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
or if they had an anesthesiologist was
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
laying out the fentanyl
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
for the next case they had it out on the
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
sterile field
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
so what kutowski would do was he would
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
take the fentanyl
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
inject himself with it
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
draw up another syringe now remember
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
when he injected himself that needle is
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
now dirty
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
he'd draw up another syringe
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
the same syringe put it back down on the
 
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
the same syringe put it back down on the
table

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
so the patient number one didn't get any
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
got some of kotowski's blood every time
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
it would be like it was somebody
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
suffering from substance use disorder
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
sharing needles that's exactly the model
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we know that in
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
in addiction when shared needles occur
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
within the first month if you're sharing
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
needles you have about an 85 percent
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
chance of getting hepatitis c
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
so that's how how contagious it is once
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
you have even droplet level trans
 
01:25:40.639 --> 01:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
you have even droplet level trans
transmission

01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the the u.s attorney
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
whose name
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
john cacaves
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
was brought in because this was clearly
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
of drug diversion
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
we ended up with 32 people
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
in just the exeter community
 
01:26:03.679 --> 01:26:05.430 align:start position:0%
in just the exeter community
infected

01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
infected
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
one of them was the very close relative
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
of one of our republican state senators
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
and who eventually died
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
so he became a very strong ally of ours
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
um some of you may have known senator
 
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.270 align:start position:0%
um some of you may have known senator
cataldo

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
then jose montero who was the state uh
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer for the department
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
of health and human services they did
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
their own investigation
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
and there were i think it was two or
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
three state reps
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
from exeter and stratum one of whom is
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
tim copeland who actually i spoke to on
 
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
tim copeland who actually i spoke to on
friday

01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
tim is a retired new york city detective
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
and to him this was criminal and we
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
needed to make sure that in the state of
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we did everything and i
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
think you were with me on this um
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
we need to do everything we possibly
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
could to make sure this never happened
 
01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:01.830 align:start position:0%
could to make sure this never happened
again

01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.790 align:start position:0%
again
so

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
we put we got tim to participate because
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
he was a state rep on the statewide
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
steering committee and we started
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about legislation
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
and essentially we did four pieces of
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
legislation out of this
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
because what we learned
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
kutowski fell into this gap
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
of people who had access to patients and
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
access to controlled substances but was
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
not listed anywhere in our state's
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory system
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
so you know physicians i'm
 
01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.310 align:start position:0%
so you know physicians i'm
i'm

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
overseen by the board of medicine pas
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
board of medicine rns
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
the nursing board
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
we've since formed the
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
board of radiology technicians um
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
senator carson and i did that together
 
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.510 align:start position:0%
senator carson and i did that together
so

01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
but all of these
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
have are regulated except this one group
 
01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:03.270 align:start position:0%
have are regulated except this one group
of

01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
in a broad term of technicians
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
or assistants
 
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.669 align:start position:0%
or assistants
who

01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
have access
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
to substance use i'm sorry to controlled
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
substances like kutowski did
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
and also have access to patients like
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
was trying to figure out how to define
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
this group
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's a really diverse group of
 
01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.229 align:start position:0%
it's a really diverse group of
professionals

01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know some are radiology tech some i
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
work with endoscopy texts
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
we have techs in offices we have
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
and so you don't want to get every
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
single medical assistant you don't want
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
to get every single endoscopy tech you
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't fit into this gap
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
the very specific definition of those
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
with substance use
 
01:28:57.199 --> 01:28:58.229 align:start position:0%
with substance use
and

01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry with the controlled uh
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
controlled uh substances and access to
 
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
controlled uh substances and access to
patients

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
so we actually it was a re-referred bill
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry it went it was in the house
 
01:29:09.679 --> 01:29:10.390 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry it went it was in the house
so

01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
we worked on this for a year and a half
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
or at least a year and brought it back
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh with pretty much unanimity
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
to close that gap
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what the board does
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's these are not people who are
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
certified they're not licensed so we're
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
not looking at competency
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we just want to know who they are
 
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
we just want to know who they are
and

01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know to follow what we saw happen in
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
if there had been a board of
 
01:29:42.639 --> 01:29:44.149 align:start position:0%
if there had been a board of
registration

01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
he would not have been able to jump from
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
hospital to hospital
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
and if you know the story he actually
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
ended up going to 16 hospitals before we
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
caught them
 
01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
caught them
in

01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the only reason we caught them was
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
because our little fledgling group
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
got every patient from the exeter
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
catchment area into one gastrointestinal
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
group or liver group otherwise if i used
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
to practice in lowell if it had been
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
lowell he
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
we have you know eight physicians and
 
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
are actually now 10 and two separate
 
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
are actually now 10 and two separate
groups

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
this might never have been discovered
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
but because it all comes into one funnel
 
01:30:23.679 --> 01:30:24.550 align:start position:0%
but because it all comes into one funnel
um

01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
we got all of the patients that he would
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
have impacted
 
01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:29.350 align:start position:0%
have impacted
nationally

01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
cacao said that he would have impacted
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
that the people he put at risk we were
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
over 8 500
 
01:30:36.719 --> 01:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
over 8 500
people

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
8 500 people
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
and there were deaths not only in our 32
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
patients but also nationwide as a result
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
because of course they did they went
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
back and looked at oh my gosh you know
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
what about hepatitis c he was at johns
 
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.229 align:start position:0%
what about hepatitis c he was at johns
hopkins

01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
hopkins
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
he was down in texas
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
five hospitals in michigan when they
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
back when they traced it back
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there were deaths that
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
were being attributed to this guy's
 
01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
were being attributed to this guy's
behavior

01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
now you may say wow all of this in
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
response to one outbreak
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's not one outbreak drug diversion
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
this was my fifth case that i knew of
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
that had touched my practice of drug
 
01:31:17.679 --> 01:31:18.870 align:start position:0%
that had touched my practice of drug
diversion

01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
diversion
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i point you to
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
one just before us
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
that was out in denver at rose memorial
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
which is an hca hospital and they had
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
multiple deaths
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
a huge hepatitis c outbreak and that was
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
the exact same it was actually an
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
anesthesia tech which would have fallen
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
actually even more so into our board of
 
01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
actually even more so into our board of
registration

01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
so the definition
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
of medical technician
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
is one that we came up with to capture
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
this group and then we further refined
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
it by saying only medical
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
technicians with exposure
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
to patients and access to controlled
 
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
to patients and access to controlled
substances

01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
substances
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
so the idea was to regulate as few as
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
possible more like a scalpel than a
 
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.229 align:start position:0%
possible more like a scalpel than a
sledgehammer

01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
as few as possible but
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure we capture
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't have any gaps in
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
all the people that we're keeping an eye
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
no behavior that would make it
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
so we don't want them practicing the
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
there were several national articles
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
about this afterwards and we talked
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
about the board i was interviewed for
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of them we talked about the board of
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
registration for medical technicians in
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
that our hope was that new hampshire was
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
but that it wouldn't be the only
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
as long as it's the only
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
it only protects us from people who are
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
moving from hospital to hospital within
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
our state right
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really protect us from
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in from out of state
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
except that once they're here if their
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
pattern is they start going you know
 
01:33:04.639 --> 01:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
pattern is they start going you know
once

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
kotowski was found down on the ground
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
with syringes in his coat pocket
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
syringes of fentanyl and he was just
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
fired this was at one of the other
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals of those 16.
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
nothing was reported police weren't
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
called he was just moved on
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
that would not happen in new hampshire
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
as long as we keep this registry intact
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
because there's no place for that person
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
to move on to in new
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
we also put in place drug free drug-free
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
workplace requirement for all licensed
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
health care facilities that was another
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill these were all strongly bipartisan
 
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.149 align:start position:0%
bill these were all strongly bipartisan
and

01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
the really telling news is that we've
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
not had another significant outbreak or
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
drug diversion case in the state of new
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire since then
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the historical background
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
for where this came from
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
as i said i'm absolutely fine with it
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
being something that doesn't require
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
quorum but still has the oversight and
 
01:34:09.199 --> 01:34:10.709 align:start position:0%
quorum but still has the oversight and
registration

01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
and it stays as narrow as
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
as this one is i don't want to regulate
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
everybody i just want to regulate those
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
who put who have a real chance of
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
putting patients at risk
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
so i'll stop and take any questions
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative lectus
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually i'm shocked that uh the
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
hospital would would find something like
 
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
that and then do nothing but fire him we
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
were too yeah um so my question is
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
given that
 
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
given that
um

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know would this person even given
 
01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
you know would this person even given
his

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
behavior another state let's say they
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
had a similar registration procedure
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
why would it be if the hospitals aren't
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
going to report anything or do anything
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
why would the registration board even
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
become aware of that behavior
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean it's a
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
horrible thing that happened a serious
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
problem but it's not clear to me
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
um that this would actually have
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
prevented it
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and it is up to
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
responsible hospitals or employers
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
remember this could be an outpatient
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
surgery center or something like that or
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
or an urgent care area that has
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the reasons that was
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
cited for them not reporting was they
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
had no real mechanism to do so that you
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
know it's either
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know we call the police or we do
 
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.109 align:start position:0%
you know we call the police or we do
nothing

01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:35:35.119 --> 01:35:36.149 align:start position:0%
nothing
and

01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
honestly it's criminal behavior and they
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
should be calling the police
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um but we've we know that that's not
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
always the case but
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
if you're terminated
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
like he was in that case
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
that has to go into the registry the
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
reason for it
 
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
reason for it
and

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.669 align:start position:0%
and
it's

01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
for the hospital it's not a high
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
liability they're required to do that so
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
it gives the hospital a much
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
even if it's just suspicion you know
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
they could potentially let somebody go
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
but it gives the hospital an in between
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
to report and it is a requirement it's a
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for a licensure so
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
were they not to do that
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem the other
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
problem is that this is also
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
self-reporting you have to tell why you
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
were terminated and
 
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
were terminated and
that

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
can generate an investigation my partner
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
was actually my medical practice partner
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
was actually on the board when it
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
started and helped to form it
 
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.830 align:start position:0%
started and helped to form it
um

01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.189 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
he was really amazed at how
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
two things one is
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
when you have a board
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very it gives due process to
 
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.669 align:start position:0%
it's a very it gives due process to
discipline

01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
he saw people
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
applying to come to the state of new
 
01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.189 align:start position:0%
applying to come to the state of new
hampshire

01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:10.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire
with

01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know you get the initial application
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
it would have some discipline issues in
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
the background
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
and when they realized that they were
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to review they
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
withdrew their application
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it is a deterrent as well as an
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
active monitoring system
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
and if we take this away we're back to
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
where we started
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to do this was not
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
only the recommendation of the steering
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
committee but also of the department of
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
health and human services and also
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
also the u.s attorney's office
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
everybody recognized this gap so i would
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
with all due respect not to
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
reopen the gap
 
01:37:50.639 --> 01:37:52.390 align:start position:0%
reopen the gap
follow-up

01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the employer would be
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
required to
report

01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
at least the reason for termination and
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
maybe other things i'm not seeing that
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the goals at all right
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.790 align:start position:0%
it is
um

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
actually the way it works because this
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the four bills that we
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
got in place is that
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
if you have if you terminate an employee
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
for cause
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
and they go to another place and that
 
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.350 align:start position:0%
and they go to another place and that
person

01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
asks you say say concord hospital in
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
exeter hospital exeter hospital there's
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who has a discipline problem
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
you terminate that employee they go over
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
to concord hospital
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
concord hospital calls exeter hospital
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
and says
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
what happened why are you why why did
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
you terminate this person
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
exeter hospital you know in the old days
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
might have said
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
all they would give was yes the
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
effective date of termination was x
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that came in gave
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
indemnity to
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
exeter hospital to report exactly
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
why the person was terminated
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
and that was part of these to make sure
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
that that communication when patients
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
lives are at risk that that level of
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
communication is open and that the
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
hospital if they report honestly
 
01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
hospital if they report honestly
truthfully

01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
truthfully
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
then they would not be subject to
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
litigation so that was another one
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
because the hospitals weren't disclosing
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
problems just one more follow-up i could
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure you understand i mean a number of
 
01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.629 align:start position:0%
sure you understand i mean a number of
uh

01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
businesses the liability issue around uh
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
providing that information so
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
is it just that
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know they they're not liable in that
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
case or is there actually something that
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
requires them
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
to report it to let's just say the board
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
of registration or anyone else i can
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
pull the statute i don't remember the
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
wording but my rec my recollection is
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
that they have to report
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
that but that they are protected in that
 
01:39:57.199 --> 01:39:58.310 align:start position:0%
that but that they are protected in that
reporting

01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative marsh uh yes uh thank you
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you senator for coming
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
before us and help explain what was a
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
really confusing thing for those of us
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
who are new to this
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
my my understanding looking at the
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
registration process in the original
 
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
registration process in the original
bill

01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
which is page 1 lines 22-27
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
is really two things are going to be red
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
flags for the people that are problems
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
first is the pending criminal charges
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
that may not be evident unless they're
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
required to report it and second of all
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
is the work history which means
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
people who go from place to place to
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
place to place are generally the ones
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
who are a problem is that your
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
understanding as well
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes and um just
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative dr marsh
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
all of the other professions
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
in healthcare have a national
 
01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:53.430 align:start position:0%
in healthcare have a national
reporting

01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
between states it's not federally
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
overseen because that that's not
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
something that you know it's like
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
insurance the
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
is left up to the states to create their
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
own boards and their own regulatory
 
01:41:04.719 --> 01:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
own boards and their own regulatory
system

01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
but they're all
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
speaking to each other
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if i
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
if i apply for
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
medica to the medical board to become a
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
physician in new hampshire
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
they query not only the practitioner
 
01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
they query not only the practitioner
database

01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
but also they will query any other place
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
where i've had
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
a license in the past and that's a huge
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
benefit to the people of new hampshire
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're not having a bad apple from
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
maryland coming to new hampshire
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
to cause trouble here and then be a
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
problem for the board
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
um that is that was our hope when the
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
board of registration as i said to to to
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
stop people like watowski from bouncing
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
from state to state
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
he learned after michigan after going to
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
five different hospitals he better get
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
out of state and go to some place fresh
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
and new and so he became a traveling
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
tech and that's how he ended up bouncing
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
i it there are states that have done
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
some form of this board of registration
 
01:42:16.239 --> 01:42:17.189 align:start position:0%
some form of this board of registration
but

01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:18.070 align:start position:0%
but
my

01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
comfort in this is that at least we have
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
it in new hampshire and and we've
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.750 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
hi

01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:42:33.679 --> 01:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
this seems to be kind of after the fact
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of puzzled by i think you said
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
8500 times this person was left alone
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the drugs
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that really the place where you
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
need to pay attention rather than right
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
oh yeah three years ago he was in this
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
other state or
 
01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:55.270 align:start position:0%
other state or
so

01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's two ways that that's being paid
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
attention to uh thank you
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's a great
 
01:43:01.199 --> 01:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's a great
question

01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
after the rose memorial incident
 
01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.550 align:start position:0%
after the rose memorial incident
um

01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
what the anesthesiologists were doing at
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
rose was they were drawing up all the
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
medications for the next case
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
and then having them ready you know
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing and and i hate to sound
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
medical but you're you're taking care of
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
a patient you've got a little bit of
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
downtime while that patient's asleep so
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
you pull up the drugs for the next case
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
put those out on the table for the next
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
case you're ready to go right you're
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
you're all prepared
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's when the tech
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know you'd start turning over the
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
room the tech would be alone in the room
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
they could
 
01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.510 align:start position:0%
they could
swipe

01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
swipe
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
those medications from the
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist the same thing was
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
the practice
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
standard practice across our state
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
of preparing for
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
a cardiac catheterization does not
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
require an anesthesiologist
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
so the cardiologist just like i as a
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
gastroenterologist can can
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
have people using i i can direct the
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
nurse to give fentanyl and versed to my
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
patients that's also the case
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
in a cardiac catheterization
 
01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.510 align:start position:0%
in a cardiac catheterization
so

01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
while there's no anesthesiologist
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily involved there is still the
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
preparation of the medications and and
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
if they are preparing them the case
 
01:44:21.679 --> 01:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
if they are preparing them the case
before

01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
then that's the opportunity for the tech
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much moved out nationally
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one in in the state of
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that steering committee we
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
identified that as a problem and it's
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
not standard of practice anymore in the
 
01:44:36.719 --> 01:44:37.669 align:start position:0%
not standard of practice anymore in the
state

01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
but two
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's two major accrediting
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
groups that go to every hospital in the
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
country they usually pick one or the
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
others one is called the joint
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission and when the joint commission
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
comes through they make sure that these
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
practices are no longer ones that that
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
can put patients at risk
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
the 8500
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
is the number of patients that he had
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
access to
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
in a setting where controlled substances
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
were involved that doesn't mean that he
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
did this 8 500 times but that's the
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
number of patients that would have been
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
at risk over the period of
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
those 16 17 hospitals including us
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative judy
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good morning good
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
morning uh after 8500
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
this guy's still
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
out there or he's in jail right now he's
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
in prison
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
he's in massachusetts he's he got 30
 
01:45:33.679 --> 01:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
he's in massachusetts he's he got 30
years

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.910 align:start position:0%
years
only

01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:37.030 align:start position:0%
only
only

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh and there's actually a documentary on
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
it there's a so this this made national
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
news i think it was newsweek or time
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
chronicled his journey through the
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and as i said it was just
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
luck that we were able to put the pieces
 
01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:01.590 align:start position:0%
luck that we were able to put the pieces
together

01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have a question for
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
senator sherman representative scitec
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
senator sherman are is there drug
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
um in fact you know i mentioned five
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
one was a gastroenterologist in leesburg
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
virginia i was practicing in manassas
 
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
virginia i was practicing in manassas
and

01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
when he went to jail
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
his patients came over to us
 
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
his patients came over to us
and

01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
they were amazed that they were actually
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
asleep for their colonoscopies because
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
he was
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
stealing the drugs that were supposed to
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
be used and they were very uncomfortable
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
my reaction is as follows
 
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:45.669 align:start position:0%
my reaction is as follows
i

01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
i'm blinded i have trouble looking at
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
this because
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
none of this should have ever happened
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
if there were proper background checks
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
if the trustees of the hospital weren't
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
scared about this guy being found with
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
the needles in on them and
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
let's hush this up i i have no such
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge but i can just picture such a
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing and
 
01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:09.350 align:start position:0%
thing and
i'm

01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
feelings settle down
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
i might be able to look at this a little
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
bit but i'm thinking
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
you've told me or you've this man
 
01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:22.950 align:start position:0%
you've told me or you've this man
koskowski

01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
koskowski
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
lots of
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
hospital hopping suppression along
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the tail not the of the
 
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.149 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the tail not the of the
dog

01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
dog
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
my story i'll match your story there was
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
a teacher at my high school
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
known by all the teachers in the high
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
school who was doing things with a
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
mentally challenged young woman
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
he left he's teaching in lawrence until
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
he retired
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
nobody no can't say a thing
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm having difficulties with this
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps wrong cure for societal
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty and i'm i can't really wrap i
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
can't sort that out
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
well i share
 
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:07.510 align:start position:0%
well i share
your

01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
i mean it's deeply troubling no matter
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
how you look at it i'd i'd really
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
recommend you go and read if you want to
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
get more troubled read that
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
piece in in i can't remember whether his
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
time or newsweek but
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
you know when you look at
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
nasa you look at
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
really great hospital systems you look
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
at health care systems the stakes and
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully school systems the stakes are
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
so high people's lives are on the line
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
and in my world
 
01:48:42.159 --> 01:48:43.430 align:start position:0%
and in my world
trust

01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
is the fundamental that's on the line
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know when i go to my doctor i put i
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
trust them to do
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and when there are techs in the room or
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
nurses in the room there's a huge amount
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
of trust you just can't avoid it but
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
there are huge amount of redundancies
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
built into the system
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
and for example you come in for a
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy i'm sorry to keep inflicting
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
colonoscopies on this committee but
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
when you come in
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the old days
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard of wrong sight
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
surgery have you ever heard of that
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
there was a person who had the wrong
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
kidney taken out and the other kidney
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
had cancer
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
so they lost both kidneys
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
i mean that's unforgivable right
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
so in colonoscopy you come in
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have a timeout that
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
means not you you didn't do anything
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
wrong not like if you were a little kid
 
01:49:46.719 --> 01:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
wrong not like if you were a little kid
but

01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a time out where the whole staff
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
makes absolutely sure not only who you
 
01:49:53.199 --> 01:49:54.229 align:start position:0%
makes absolutely sure not only who you
are

01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
but also that we're doing the right
 
01:49:56.239 --> 01:49:58.229 align:start position:0%
but also that we're doing the right
procedure

01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's called a timeout that has come
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
not because it's a great idea but it's
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
come because with all the checks and
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
balances we have all the people doing
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the intake people still get the wrong
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
kidney taken out
 
01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.430 align:start position:0%
kidney taken out
so

01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
this may not this is clearly not the
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
only answer to making sure we don't have
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
another outbreak or drug diversion
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
but it is a part of that redundancy in
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
the system that is has very low impact
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
on somebody who's not doing anything
 
01:50:28.239 --> 01:50:29.830 align:start position:0%
on somebody who's not doing anything
wrong

01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
but in terms of catching somebody or
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
deterring somebody who is intent on
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
criminal activity like drug diversion
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is one part of our repertoire one
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
part one arrow in our quiver
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure it never happens and i'll
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
tell you as someone
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
who then
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
had to treat those 32 patients
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
afterwards it was
 
01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:53.990 align:start position:0%
afterwards it was
uh

01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
i can't really describe what it was like
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
in those times there was one gentleman
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
who we got through because all we had
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
available in the early parts of this was
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
this horrible combination of drugs
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
riboviron interferon
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i would see him every week during
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
the course of his treatment
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
and when it was over
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
he cleared the virus and
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
we celebrated together
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
senator sherman my
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
my mother was having a procedure done on
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
one of her knees and took it upon
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
herself with a sharpie to right wrong
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
knee on her other knee smart when she
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
had discussions with the doctor after he
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
or the surgeon he was uh not thrilled
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
at that i would have been thrilled at
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
that i have patients who actually put a
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
dotted line across the lower part of
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
their back and said if you can read this
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're too high up you know it's
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's for a colonoscopy but you know the
 
01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.669 align:start position:0%
it's for a colonoscopy but you know the
more

01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the more we do
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
to protect ourselves and our loved ones
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
the better as long as it's not
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
overdoing it and that's why i think this
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
closing the gap
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
we worked really hard and if if we're
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
wrong if there need to be tweaks that's
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
but we worked really hard to get the
 
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
but we worked really hard to get the
definition

01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
that was imperfect but really captured
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
the smallest number of people
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
in that huge group of professionals that
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
make up medical technicians
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
that would actually be regulated
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that you know there's a cost and
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's work that's done on the registry
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
side and i think i think we hit the
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
right balance
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
but um you know i'm always open
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion i just would ask you please
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
don't repeal it because it is
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
one while it may be redundant it may not
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
be perfect
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
it is one of the things uh that we have
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
in place to protect patients in new
 
01:52:59.119 --> 01:53:03.109 align:start position:0%
in place to protect patients in new
hampshire

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative judy yes thank you
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
senator i'm back again
 
01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
senator i'm back again
um

01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
after infected so many people
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.199 --> 01:53:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
because um i'm trying to say this is
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
public record he was one of the patients
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
that was in the group
 
01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
that was in the group
so

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
you know when you have a whole bunch of
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
80 year olds
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
who are infected or people with cardiac
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
disease then you have
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
one person
 
01:53:37.599 --> 01:53:38.790 align:start position:0%
one person
who

01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
is infected with the exact same strain
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know we can subtype hepatitis c just
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
like you've heard of omicron and delta
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
and all that we can do the same thing
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
with hepatitis c so we can it has a
 
01:53:50.239 --> 01:53:52.149 align:start position:0%
with hepatitis c so we can it has a
fingerprint

01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
fingerprint
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
so you follow the fingerprints and
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:03.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
senator

01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
you stated that
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
you were okay with the underlying bill
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
which makes this board advisory
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
but would it be your preference to
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually not do anything and leave the
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
board just as it is in law now
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because you know they're
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
having trouble staffing the board
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
really what i care about is that we
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
register people
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
and that there's adequate oversight if
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
you just register people and you don't
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
have any oversight that doesn't help
 
01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:38.950 align:start position:0%
have any oversight that doesn't help
much

01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
in fact it's a waste of everyone's time
 
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:41.750 align:start position:0%
in fact it's a waste of everyone's time
so

01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
if they're registered and
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
they meet and they have essentially the
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
same function i don't think it has to be
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily at the level of a board
 
01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.189 align:start position:0%
necessarily at the level of a board
but

01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
just so long as the function and the
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
protection for patients is the same
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the committee have
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um just on this last issue
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
if the board is just advisory and not
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
if if their advisory that seems to imply
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
that they can't make any decisions
 
01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:27.510 align:start position:0%
that they can't make any decisions
so

01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:28.709 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody if that gentleman were to
 
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:32.709 align:start position:0%
if somebody if that gentleman were to
have

01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
applied to be
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
a tech in new hampshire
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the background
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
check shows
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
if if the board is only divi advisory
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that he will just slip
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
through and be registered i'll jump in
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
on that one representative fellows the
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
way the bill's written this would fall
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
under the office of the executive
 
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.430 align:start position:0%
under the office of the executive
director

01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
so this would not this would not be
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
something that would slip through a
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
correct exactly my concern
 
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
correct exactly my concern
that

01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
it would be doctors and medical
 
01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.470 align:start position:0%
it would be doctors and medical
professionals

01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
that would feel comfortable to say
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
this person
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want this person i
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
mean i'm not talking about if he's been
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
convicted that's totally different right
 
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
but to see something
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
suspicious or that needs follow-up
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that somebody who doesn't
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
have a medical background is not going
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
to identify that there's an issue there
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
well i'd answer that
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
with two things one is i would defer to
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
what level of oversight she would
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate they were able to provide
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
two is that
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
she would have access or i would have
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
presumed this board would have access to
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
all the different
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
if they had a question about the
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
clinical side on the other hand
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
i think one of the reasons one of the
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
drivers for this bill is that they just
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to staff the board
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
with health care professionals and
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
i would i don't know if mike padmore has
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
spoken yet but i'm generally what we do
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
is we
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
hear from the boards that they need
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
staff like the board of medicine the
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
board of nursing they'll go to the
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
nurses association
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then we get volunteers for them to
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
serve on those boards and i don't know
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
if that was ever flagged for the
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
hospital association or
 
01:57:37.679 --> 01:57:39.350 align:start position:0%
hospital association or
the

01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
board of medicine that they were having
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the medical society that they
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
were having problems staffing these
 
01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:45.990 align:start position:0%
were having problems staffing these
boards

01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:46.790 align:start position:0%
boards
but

01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
if they weren't talking to the societies
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's probably why they weren't able to
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.149 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard from many um we've
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
heard reports on about many boards not
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
just the medical ones that have a
 
01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:07.510 align:start position:0%
just the medical ones that have a
difficulty

01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know holding a quorum in and getting
 
01:58:10.239 --> 01:58:11.669 align:start position:0%
you know holding a quorum in and getting
volunteers

01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
do you think if we were to add
 
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:16.390 align:start position:0%
do you think if we were to add
alternates

01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
alternates
 
01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.669 align:start position:0%
alternates
to

01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
the board then that would make it easier
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
for it for them to be available and
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
also we've talked about it it's not in
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
any bills if they could participate via
 
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.470 align:start position:0%
any bills if they could participate via
zoom

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know that might work it might not
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
work for for things when you're talking
 
01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:35.510 align:start position:0%
work for for things when you're talking
about

01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
a specific individual but some
 
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.270 align:start position:0%
a specific individual but some
strategies

01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
like that other than just making an
 
01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:42.629 align:start position:0%
like that other than just making an
advisory

01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
well anytime
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
you ask
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
any professionals to participate in
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
something that's volunteer
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
that takes them away from their day job
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult and i think you know
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen that
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
during covet we've seen that but
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think number one alternates would be
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh number two is um
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
there is a benefit to being in person
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
being able to see each other like today
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
being able to look at you all in the
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
eyes and make sure we're all on the same
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
page and that i'm really answering
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative lexus's question
 
01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
representative lexus's question
um

01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:24.709 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
but you know the reality is that virtual
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
for some of these boards would probably
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
make participation easier and
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate people volunteering for it
 
01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.910 align:start position:0%
facilitate people volunteering for it
because

01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
you'd get people from all over the state
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
which is the other benefit is that you
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
get a much more diverse
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
group of
 
01:59:43.679 --> 01:59:49.910 align:start position:0%
group of
participants

01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions for the senator
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
before i cut them loose
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you senator sherman
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
happy to come back if you have more
 
01:59:58.239 --> 02:00:01.510 align:start position:0%
happy to come back if you have more
questions

02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the last pink card i
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
have concerning
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
this public hearing on the non-germain
 
02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:10.550 align:start position:0%
this public hearing on the non-germain
amendment

02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
i don't mind at all
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm gonna i'm gonna trust that since
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
you are an orange bed you have a rough
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the procedures of how
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
we operate here
 
02:00:21.119 --> 02:00:22.149 align:start position:0%
we operate here
so

02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's make sure we uh
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um for the record
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
my name is mike padmore and i'm the
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
director of advocacy with the new
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society um i did want
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
to just come in and testify um and just
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
share our opposition to the the
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment for hb
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
1330. i'm not going to repeat uh what
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
senator sherman has outlined already i
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
think that he did a great job of
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
explaining the background of why this
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
board was established what i would
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
simply just say is
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
from our perspective this is just a
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
patient safety issue
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
as practices are
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
hiring building out their practices
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know they want as many different
 
02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.669 align:start position:0%
you know they want as many different
resources

02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
at their disposal as possible
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions this is
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
certainly one of those resources
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
so i would just simply say please don't
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
take that away
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i think to one of the questions and
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
forgive me representative the the chair
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
is just in the way of your name so i'm
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
just missing uh uh your name but uh this
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
would be representative scitec scitec uh
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um i did just want to
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
say so you had brought up an analogy um
 
02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:33.750 align:start position:0%
say so you had brought up an analogy um
of

02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
an abusive teacher in schools what i
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
would simply just say is it's one of the
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
reasons why i think we have a sex
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
offender registry
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
it may not catch that first instance of
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
abuse but certainly the hope and the
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
goal is is to then prevent those abuses
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the future and i think the same
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
concept does follow with this obviously
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
um in the instance that senator sherman
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
had outlined in the early 2000 or early
 
02:01:57.679 --> 02:01:59.270 align:start position:0%
had outlined in the early 2000 or early
2010s

02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
2010s
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
that first instance had gone on for many
 
02:02:02.159 --> 02:02:03.350 align:start position:0%
that first instance had gone on for many
times

02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
but the hope is i think is that if there
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
is a registry in place it does at least
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
help prevent those those abuses in the
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
future it may not prevent every abuse
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
but if it is one additional resource i
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
think the hope is is that it can help
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
to prevent those abuses moving forward
 
02:02:19.199 --> 02:02:20.149 align:start position:0%
to prevent those abuses moving forward
so

02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
i would just conclude my testimony by
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
saying you know please
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
please don't repeal this board we do
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
feel that it is a helpful resource um
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
to our physicians in the state to our
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
practices in the state and i'm happy to
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i do have a question and that's
 
02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.149 align:start position:0%
yeah i do have a question and that's
this

02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
suppose at a given hospital in new
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire some
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
some personnel technician doctor
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
caught stealing
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
and he's fired
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
when he goes to another hospital or
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
another wherever and asks and they ask
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh you the original hospital
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
why did he leave what would that
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
hospital say the original hospital
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
i to
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i don't i
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically what they would
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
say but i do think in the case of
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
physicians you know they are regulated
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
with the board of medicine so there at
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
least is that aspect of oversight that
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
physicians do have from a professional
 
02:03:23.679 --> 02:03:24.790 align:start position:0%
physicians do have from a professional
standpoint

02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.669 align:start position:0%
standpoint
and

02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
as as was stated by um
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
from earlier testimony the reason why
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
this board was established is because
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
these professionals don't fall into any
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
of those um
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
those established boards so this at
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
least would provide some oversight to
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
those individuals to your question on on
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
the physician who's who's fired by uh
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
one hospital
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak to that specific
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
instance but at least there is that
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism of the board of medicine that
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
has oversight uh and and a complaint
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
certainly could be filed uh by a
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
hospital to the board you know let
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
making the board aware that that a an
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
let me refine that a little bit suppose
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
the doctor is let go because
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
he maintains his credentials but he's
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
just not a good doctor they don't like
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
him he's just
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
careless whatever but he keeps his
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
credentials so they quietly he's out the
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
door what's the next hospital here
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
when they ask
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
do you re the hospital the original
 
02:04:30.239 --> 02:04:32.709 align:start position:0%
do you re the hospital the original
hospital

02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:04:32.719 --> 02:04:33.750 align:start position:0%
hospital
so

02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
is the question what would that what is
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
the recourse at that hospital what kind
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
of reference would he get
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
i i mean i suppose it would come down to
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
if that if that uh that hiring hospital
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
had reached out to to the hospital prior
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh depending on what the cv uh what the
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
physician's cv looks like you know that
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
is that is on the hospital that's hiring
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
to to go through the due diligence i
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
guess what i'm just saying in terms of
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
this board is that this is one of those
 
02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:05.030 align:start position:0%
this board is that this is one of those
resources

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
does any other member of the committee
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
have questions for the
 
02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.229 align:start position:0%
have questions for the
gentleman

02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
gentleman
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
is anyone else in the room wishing to
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll close the public
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on the
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
that is the final thing that we have the
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
only thing that we have as a board today
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
or as a committee today um is this
 
02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:41.669 align:start position:0%
or as a committee today um is this
um
