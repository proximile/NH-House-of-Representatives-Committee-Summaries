consent all
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
right while we are in um executive
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
session I believe represent L has a
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
motion to retain um yes Madam chair um I
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
would like to to move to retain House
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
Bill 349 which is the opthalmologic
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
laser bill I'll be happy to second that
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay yes if you'd like to speak to your
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you madam chair uh this
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
is an issue that's been uh worked on
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
over the previous year and we need to
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit more time it
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
seems that the opthalmologists are doing
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
a good job of getting increased service
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
and coverage up in the north country and
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
the optometrist would like to have some
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
more time to make sure that they can
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
make clear to us what's what training
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
standards would be required for um
 
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
somebody to perform these opthalmologic
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
laser procedures uh given that this is
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for them to get us more
 
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
information I think it makes sense for
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
us to retain the bill um rather than to
 
00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.749 align:start position:0%
us to retain the bill um rather than to
proceed

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
now repr
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson that was uh eloquently stated
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
and exactly what I was thinking
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
excellent does anyone else have
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
concerns representative
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I I absolutely agree that this
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
is uh better for us to retain as
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
indicating uh that we have a concern
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
about this issue but uh in my belief uh
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
this should be worked out by the
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
profession not by the legislature
 
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
exactly and it I would agree with that
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
they should they should be working it
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
out all right any other comments for the
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
power no
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right in that case the motion
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
is to retain House Bill
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
349 and the clerk can call the
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%

no question of consent and U that will
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
we will be awaiting information from the
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
affected parties and work on it over the
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
summer all
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
right does anyone else have something
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
on I do need to go get an amendment from
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh the fourth floor so if we have time
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
we we've got 20 minutes now
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair I'm just wondering if
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's anything from the building code
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting that
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we're ready to exec
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
any of those bills but I'm just asking
 
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.589 align:start position:0%
any of those bills but I'm just asking
about

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
that there was one that uh we could
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
retain vote to retain okay and that was
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
um H the other two are still in work
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
244 and that's
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
the the is that Municipal Amendment um
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
that is updating and Rec codifying the
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
municipal enforcement of the building
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
and fire codes that's the recodification
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay definitely want to retain that one
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so that was the 2425 page bill that
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
needs more eyes to to look at it and um
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
make sure everything's in
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
motion okay and I'll just add that Rec
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
rectifying the statutes is is a is a
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
good idea needs to be done every now and
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
then but you it does need very careful
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
scrutiny to make sure you
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
don't looking out
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
for unanticipated
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
represent any other comments
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing then that the
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
motion is to retain House Bill

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
convenience all
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
right and you have have another motion
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
for us I do Madam chair I have another
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to introduce to House
 
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.190 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to introduce to House
Bill

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
233 amendment
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
163h that you all should have in front
 
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.470 align:start position:0%
163h that you all should have in front
of

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
you so all right so that they we have an
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
233 do you wish to speak to the motion
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
oh first of all is there a second second
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
second by representative Lon
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
do wish to speak to your motion yes
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I think we
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
took from the public hearing on this
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
was two things one I think there was a
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of a misunderstanding as to
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what this organization does
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
which I appreciate the clarity of of
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
straightening some of that
 
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
out um I think they made made it
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear that
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of the
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
questions that they take really have
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with them so uh looking at
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh I think it's it's
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
prudent that the request that
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
they answer questions that really have
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with them and post and go
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
through this whole process was really
 
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.349 align:start position:0%
through this whole process was really
just

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh and too burdensome but on
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
the flip side of
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
that in 2025 the idea that a meeting
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
that is electronically created then gets
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
transcribed into minutes like it's 1920
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
is also weird and I think with a little
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
bit of a you know some of the testimony
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
with those that are in a perhaps
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
different generational category than
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
some of us we see that you know they
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
really would rather prefer just to click
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
on the meeting and watch it so I think
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
that that request Quest is is certainly
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable um it is a very inexpensive
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
thing to do and frankly we'll save them
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
from having someone to type up a set of
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
minutes so that is the the gist of this
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
amendment it simply just removes the
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
requirement in section
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
B okay
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
BL um thank you madam chair um while
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
this is a public private partnership a
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
lot of what they execute um regards
 
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
contract with the federal government and
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
other things that really directly impact
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
the lives of people in New Hampshire and
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
the transparency of how that is
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
implemented I think is critical to make
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
sure that people understand what is
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
happening in the state and that they're
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
able to be up to date on these policies
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
because um quite frankly some of the
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
policies from the New Hampshire uh
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association um we've heard from
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
pediatricians that that's a reason why
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
they are not no longer accepting certain
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
patients in their practice this likely
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
is an issue at the DC level and not at
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire level but having
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
transparency and seeing what's happening
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
in those meetings and exactly what
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing allows people to know
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
where to focus their efforts and
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
understand why they're being denied
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
care representative G thank you I have a
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
question for well I wanted to discuss it
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
with the committee I don't believe that
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
a video is an official Rec is an
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
official uh document of the meeting I
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
know that in our town we have to have
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes on file for all of our
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
organiz for all of our meetings so I
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe that in this case this
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
would alleviate the New Hampshire
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination board from transcribing
 
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.589 align:start position:0%
vaccination board from transcribing
their

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
meetings as a private entity I'm not
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
aware of the requirement that they keep
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and the other is that this is a
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
501c3 organization and I don't know of
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
any other 501c3 organizations that we um
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
do this for I don't mind the committee
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
setting a part policy but this is not
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
policy setting in my view this is
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
picking a specific
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
organization and if we're going to if
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
this is important to us we should be
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
doing this to all entities in New
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so P that perhaps we want to
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
change the bill to reflect that I'll be
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
voting against this amendment because I
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't don't think that just picking on
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
one group is helpful if that's our
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
Quest okay anyone else comment
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative citech uh a couple points
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to representative groda
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
I think we can make as a legislature
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
anything we want to be official and I
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't think any the video recording
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
could just is uh could be defined to be
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
by the legislature as official as
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
anything else I think minutes are almost
 
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.230 align:start position:0%
anything else I think minutes are almost
an

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
the second point is I'll vote for the
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think think it
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
improves the bill but I'll vote against
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
the bill on the basis that this is a not
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
this is not a public body this is a pass
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
through organization doing
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
administrative tasks and well it might
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
be nice to do it I don't think we have
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
the business to impose this requirement
 
00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
on them so uh I'm I'll vote against the
 
00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:53.069 align:start position:0%
on them so uh I'm I'll vote against the
the

00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
concerns okay the motion is to adopt
 
00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:06.270 align:start position:0%
concerns okay the motion is to adopt

amendment 8 to five representative
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson you have a
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
motion yes Madam chair I'll move um
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
autop pass is amended on House Bill
 
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.390 align:start position:0%
autop pass is amended on House Bill
233

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
second any disc do you wish to speak to
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment is a in essence a rewrite
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
a full rewrite so what is what has
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
already been said I think suffices as
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing okay represent
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
concerns all right seeing none the
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass with Amendment

01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
morning be before I open the hearing on
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 536 representative scitec has
 
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.430 align:start position:0%
House Bill 536 representative scitec has
an

01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
announcement uh this has to do with a
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest in this bill and in
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
general actually microphone I think I
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
have it on the uh we're all familiar
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
with the conflict of interest procedure
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and the Declaration of intent uh that no
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
Declaration of intent isn't required if
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
something of legislation does not affect
 
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
affect you to a greater extent than to
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
any other member of such a business um
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
that's familiar language and we file a
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
declaration of intent form that says we
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
will participate or not participate but
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
sixa this I'm reading from the U ethics
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines recusal for conflicts of
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
interest and B says uh the legislator or
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
a member of legislator's household could
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
reasonably be expected to incur direct
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
and substantial benefit or detriment as
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
a result of the outcome because this is
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
a cola which would affect me as a member
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the group one uh basically for the
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
rest of my life that sounds like it's
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
direct and substantial so as I read this
 
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
thing there's sort of a there is a
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
conflict I believe in the in the
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
conflict procedure and um I'm going to
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think I am going to recuse myself
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
especially since I'm in no one of the
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%

coast I um sponsor I'm sponsoring this
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill which asks the legislature to issue
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
a cost of living adjustment to those
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
members of the retirement system some of
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
you who were here for our retirement
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
system presentation at the beginning of
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
this session in
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
orientation may have reviewed their the
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
presentation slides last night as I did
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to um point to slide number
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
23 which outlines the number of
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
individuals under each
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
category each pay category
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
also on slide 22 it describes the groups
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
one and two retirement
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
retirees and the average salary that
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
they get as a retirement and the average
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
for all
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
retirees and this bill asks that a 1 and
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
a half% cola be given to individuals who
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
make up to
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and for those individuals who
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
make more than that the cola would be
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
1.5% for the first
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and just for those of you who um
 
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
are ask are wondering how much that is
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
$750 which to me is a small amount
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
to be compensated for for the increases
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
in household goods that we've all
 
01:18:52.679 --> 01:18:55.229 align:start position:0%
in household goods that we've all
experienced

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
um this is a policy committee and you
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
are making a decision on the policy as
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
to whether or not the retirees should be
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
getting a cola and not the financial
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
policy because this bill goes to finance
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
this bill has passed this commission
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
before and um several times actually and
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
when it has
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
reached Finance what they've chosen to
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
give instead of the one 1 and a half% is
 
01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:26.709 align:start position:0%
give instead of the one 1 and a half% is
a

01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
stiped so that the financial impact is
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
less than the one that's outlined in
 
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.709 align:start position:0%
less than the one that's outlined in
this

01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill the latest stiens in 2022 and 2023
 
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.669 align:start position:0%
bill the latest stiens in 2022 and 2023
were

01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
$500 so I wanted to um I'm I support
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
this bill I support um you know I
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
support the families that work um for
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
and have the retirement system as their
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
benefit package and it's uh important
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
that Gran stators feel that there's
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who's listening to them when it
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
comes to their monetary requirements for
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
their household and with that I'd like
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
to close my testimony because there are
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
several people who wish to speak in
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
favor of The
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
Spill and to make things oh you have a
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
question representative Schmid do you
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
have a question I do Madam chair thank
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
you do you know what the cost would be
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
to the retirement
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
system uh terminally funding
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
this this is funded through State
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
contributions because remember um
 
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities pay into the retirement
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
system so this is paid for by the
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
providers it's not paid for by the
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system itself so the
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities would pay as well as the
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
state do but do you follow up follow up
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
schmi the retirement system is going to
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
speak next and they have the real data
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
on the on the numbers and I think they'd
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
be a better person to answer your
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
question I certainly would ask them but
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
I thought maybe the sponsor
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
knows thank you okay other questions
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Mark kavar Deputy
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
counsel and compliance officer for the
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire retirement system and
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
with me is Diana kryon she's our
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
hearings examiner she's an attorney as
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
well and she's helping to fill in the
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
gaps and uh support us uh while we're
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
appointed I'm here today just
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
to just to speak to the
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
funding um I understand that the
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee just was made available the
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notice prepared by
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
LBA and there's two components to the
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
cost of this we take no policy position
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
on whether cost of living is good or bad
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision for the
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee but we want to point out that
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
annual uh
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh starting in 2028 as
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in the contribution
 
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.870 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in the contribution
rates

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
um of 1.5 million for the state and 6.6
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
million for the political
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and uh that's um how
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
the uh rates would be affected by this
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
going forward primarily an increase in
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
the normal cost
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
cost uh for for new employees as you or
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
for retirees as you figure that in um
 
01:23:06.669 --> 01:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this is that the
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
bill provides that it shall be
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
terminally funded from the state annuity
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
accumulation fund and that's that I I
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be careful that that's
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
not misleading because the state annuity
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
accumulation fund is us we have a member
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
annuity accumulation fund which is made
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
of of member cont contributions in in in
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
their interest they get allocated then
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
we have the state annuity accumulation
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
fund which is employer contributions and
 
01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
Investments earnings and so this is
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded it's not terminally funded
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not providing any outside
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
source of funds to pay for this and thus
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
this will increase our uh UA or unfunded
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
million and I'd open it up for
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Lam um
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
being here to answer questions um
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
looking at this fiscal note it looks
 
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
that there'll be a cost to our um
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions of $6.6
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
million um in addition to basically
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
what's the unfunded cost to the state
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
does so looking at this bill that would
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
then mean that our municipalities um
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
that are having a hard time right now
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
with the same inflation would then need
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
to foot the bill for this would that be
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
correct right this is the uh you know
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
rates for the prior fiscal years have
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
been set so uh the next time rates will
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
be changed would be fiscal year
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
28 and this is the actuary's prediction
 
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:49.719 align:start position:0%
of what the increase total cost that
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in those rates would
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
be follow follow and as a followup do
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know if that would increase the
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
percentage that the employ that the
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
employers need to contribute to the
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system yes it would do you
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
know by how much or no right there oh
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
sorry my apologies I didn't do a good
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
job reading the fiscal note yeah on the
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
on the back side you can see uh what the
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
net impact of The Proposal as a percent
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
of payroll would be for each of the four
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
member groups for political Subs 15% for
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
employees 23 for teachers 05%
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
for employees. 23 for teachers 0 43 for
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
you anything else just a
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
curiosity the reason police and fire are
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
higher is Bec is that because they their
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
pensions are larger or is it because
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
they live longer after
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
retirement I I would this is yes I'm a
 
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer non
 
01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.750 align:start position:0%
lawyer non
actuary

01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
actuary
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the benefit caps at 50 but the
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
average group one benefit is in the low
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
20s there are more group twos who have
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
benefits in the 30s and 40s who would
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
receive a larger
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
cola thank you very much Madam chair I I
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
can also point out to your question that
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
police and fire are a much much smaller
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
subset so when you're yes I I'm well
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
running over a cost right you're
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
dividing it amongst the entities I was
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
just wondering about the difference okay
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
other questions from the retirement
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
system anyone I I have one representa
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
pear this is as we see these over the
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
years these are all stretched out over a
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
time frame and the 100.7 millionar is
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of stretching this over a
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
20-year period correct right it's the
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
present value cost of providing that
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
cost to live an increase over whatever
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
longterm period this to be paid for in
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
one shot what's that number $ 100.7
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
million so 100.7 then then I guess I'm
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
I'm confuses yeah it's either well if
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's in one shot if it's $1.7 million in
 
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
one shot which seems a atrociously high
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
to me for an immediate payment over 20
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
years it can't be
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
100.7 no it's the presid value so the
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the U is the present value
 
01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
of paying everyone else up to
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
$750 a month a year more for the rest of
 
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
$750 a month a year more for the rest of
their

01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
lives okay so you bring that down to a
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
present value if you want to pay for it
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
all now you pay that present value
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
because we'd have the 100.7 million and
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
we'd invest it and have those investment
 
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
earnings to to because the real dollar
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
amount you added up over the next 30
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
Years is way more you're just counting
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
it I got you okay that you answered
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you okay all right other
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
repres uh if I I want to make sure I
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
understand the the financial side of
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
this um so how I how I Envision this
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
working is that it brings in the
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
ultimate zero date for the pension
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
system so that whatever money we're
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
saving whatever date that runs out if we
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't address the um the the outstanding
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
liability that that date would be sooner
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
because of this if this bill were to
 
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
pass uh not necessarily so if you're
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
increasing the unfunded liability by
 
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.070 align:start position:0%
increasing the unfunded liability by
$100

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
$100
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
million uh the next time that rates
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
employer rates are set in two years the
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
actual would take into account that it's
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
larger and then would uh concominant
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
increase the employer contributions
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
towards the UA to make that
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
payment uh to bring the U Down
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically to zero under our current
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
plan which is
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
2039 so it all all gets worked into the
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
numbers over time
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
we a few years back we took the existing
 
01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
UA and locked it in to end in
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
2039 and every two years there after we
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
look at all the changes and say all
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
right that's an extra
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
50 million plus 20 million minus or
 
01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
50 million plus 20 million minus or
whatever

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
and uh amortise that over up to 20 years
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
which in practice means 20 years so this
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
would be an increase that would start in
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
28 and go on to 48
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you that that that's correct
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
Madam chair that this additional
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
liability we have layered amortization
 
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
the first layer was our original plan
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
for for what it was in 2010 or 11 to
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
bring that down to Zero by
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
2039 you have subsequent changes that
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
can be due to Le uh unfunded legislation
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
such as this or changes in actual
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
assumptions or maybe a really bad
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
investment Year and that additional
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded amount is then in a separate
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
layer that's advertised over 20 years so
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
we currently have two layers this would
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
create a third layer that we'd amortize
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
that 100 million over 20 years yes and
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
that would be again reflected in the
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
rates and if we manage to go two years
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
without increasing the UA and have a
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
very good investment year we might
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
actually have a negative layer of
 
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.229 align:start position:0%
actually have a negative layer of
amortisation

01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
amortisation
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes um not we'll see it when it happens
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tio thank you madam
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering um how
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
would this um Bill impact that 2039 goal
 
01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
would this um Bill impact that 2039 goal
or

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
deadline uh it it would not affect the
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
deadline it would affect employer
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
rates the next time we'd have that
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
separate layer and then we'd have to say
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
how do we amortise that 100 million over
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years the 2039 date was to
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh amortize
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability as it existed
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
when that uh date was established in two
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
I believe it was 2010 or 11
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
um and then each subsequent change in
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
the UA is advertised over 20
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
years this would mean that in if every
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
everything else was Zero the bulk of UA
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be paid off in 39 but this slice
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
48 okay other
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%

a 1 a half% cost of living adjustment
 
01:33:07.109 --> 01:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
based on the first $50,000 of retirement
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
similar to this piece of legislation the
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
cost of living based on the CPU for that
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
same time period has increased by
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
38.6% while retirees received a 1 and a
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
half% cost of living adjustment cost of
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
living adjustments in New Hampshire
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
retirement system have been far and few
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
between since 2000 2010 Most states that
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
surround us provide an annual cost of
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
living increase to their retirees it is
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to maintain the rising cost of
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
inflation without an adequate cost of
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
living adjustment uh just to answer a
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions that were asked
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
to Prior speakers um first of all police
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
and fire uh fire live less than the
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
normal population
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
um they actually use a different
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
mortality table for the retirement
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
system for firefighters because of our
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
life expectancy um secondly uh cost of
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
living raises when the system was
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
developed in 1967 they were granted
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
similar to what this legislation is
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
doing from ' 67 to 83 before they
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
started the special account they would
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
Grant the cola uh back then the legisl
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
Met every other year so they would Grant
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
the 2-year Cola and it would the
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system would just Bild
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
each department uh town or city for
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
their members that were impacted with
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
that cost of living rise then in 28 uh
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
in uh 1983 when the special account was
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
developed for SP cost of living raises
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association and others
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
were in favor of that because they
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
didn't like getting those bills every
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
other year uh to pay for their retirees
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
they felt this was going to be a cost
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
savings to them hav come out of a
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
special account and that went on until
 
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
20 2 when they eliminated the special
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
account and the only way now to get a
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
cost of living raise is through enabling
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislation like this to Grant uh colas
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and one other point I would like to
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
make group two does not pay into Social
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
Security so the cost of living from the
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system is really the main
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
stay of what retired firefighters earn
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
live off of U they don't have social
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
security uh where group one does so
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between how it was
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
and how it is today and I will take any
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there a
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%

Association I'm here today to ask your
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
support on House Bill 536 relative to a
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment in the state
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
retirement system this bill grants a
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment to any retired
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
member in the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
system who has been retired for at least
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
60 months prior to July 1
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
2025 or to any beneficiary of a retiree
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
who is receiving an
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
allowance the supplemental allowance
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
would be 1.5% of the first $50,000 of
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
retired member or benefici beneficiaries

2026 the supplemental allowance will
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
become a permanent addition to the
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%

state annuity accumulation fund you may
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
recall the legislature passed similar
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislation House Bill 616 in 2019 the
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
only difference being it was for those
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
who were retired for 60 months prior to
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
July 1 2019
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%

dedicated public servants who have
 
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
helped build New Hampshire and continue
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
to keep New Hampshire great today we are
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
here asking for your help as you know
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of living is gone up for all
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
Americans but especially for older
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
americ Americans who have higher medical
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
costs dental and prescription drug
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
expenses which often rise faster than
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
the general rate of
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
inflation Rising prices in inflation can
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
quickly erode the value of one's
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
retirement's income even a modest rate
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
of inflation significally impacts
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing power over time from March
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
2020 to 24 the CPI for food at home had
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
risen by
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
24.7% outpacing the 20.3% increase
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
observed to across other CPI categories
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
this equates to roughly a 25% overall
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
increase in the cost of grocery store
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
items compared to just four years ago
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
simply put our pensions are not keeping
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
up with inflation many current retirees
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
are forced to make some very very
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions as their pension
 
01:38:44.599 --> 01:38:45.790 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions as their pension
values

01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
values
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
decrease that's why I'm here today
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
asking for your help historically before
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
1983 cost of living adjustments were
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
funded each budget year through the
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
state operating budget the legislator
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 500 in 1983 which
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
created the special account the special
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
account was funded through excess
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
earnings from the retirement system in
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
excess of a half perc over the rate of
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
return the funds in the special account
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
were used to pay for colas ranging from
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 1 to 5% as determined by
 
01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.510 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 1 to 5% as determined by
the

01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
legislature this special account was
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
closed in 2012 and the remaining monies
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
were transferred into the Corpus of the
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
fund now the legislature by Statute
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
decides whether a cola is given and how
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
much is granted there is no builtin
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
which puts the retirement security of
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of retirees solely in the
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
hands of the
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
legislature that's why we're here today
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
urging you to pass House Bill
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
536 retirement security is something
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
every employee deserves after a long
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
successful career in public service New
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirees have dedicated their
 
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
working life to helping our state run
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
every day and have earned a benefit that
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
should allow them to retire with dignity
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
in exchange for a lifetime of service
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
our retired employees deserve a Divine
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
defined and predictable retirement
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
security that is protected against
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressures HB 536 helps with
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
that security and that's why we ask for
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
your support ideally this bill would be
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
a step towards what used to be the norm
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
when retirees could expect a permanent
 
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.149 align:start position:0%
when retirees could expect a permanent
regular

01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
Cola some may tell you today that we
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
need to wait on doing this I would
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
respond to that by saying we cannot
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
simply ask those members who cons
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
consistently paid into the system over
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
many years to continue to wait let's
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
make this permanent addition to a
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
retiree's pension a reality and show our
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
retirees they are not forgotten thank
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr gulla are there any
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair members of the
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
Brian will I the president of the
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we represent approximately
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
2,000 active and retired firefighters
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the Granite State uh I'm
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
going to be incredibly brief this
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
morning which I'm sure you're all happy
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
to hear um I'm going to speak to you
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
from more of a philosophical standpoint
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
less of a technical standpoint um we
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 536 for a number of
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
reasons uh primarily uh for our members
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
it it comes down to the fact that
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
they've felt the squeeze over the years
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
um with inflation being what it is uh
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
and the inability to have a steady cost
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
of living adjustment over that same
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
period of time um these are members that
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
um you know have served in 20 25 30e
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
careers and the fire service uh have put
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
their their health and their safety at
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
risk for those that they serve um and
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
you know in as a thanks for that we give
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
them um you know a fair uh pension but
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
that does not keep up with inflation as
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
we know it um as was mentioned earlier
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
these members do not pay into Social
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
Security thus they do not collect Social
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
Security from these positions um which
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
makes it far more difficult for them to
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
survive on um their retirement uh after
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
10 15 20 years of service um these are
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
members that are
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
also um in sending money back to our
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
Economy based on um you know
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
Approximately 80% of them stay within uh
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
the confines of New Hampshire after they
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
retire uh and if you look back on uh
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics a dollar 20
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
years ago is approximately a161 today um
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
in purchasing power and so I think we
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
need to consider the fact that we have
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
80% of our retirees remaining here in
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um who are uh infusing
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
money back into the
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
state um the National Institute of
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
retirement security uh provides an
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
economic impact profile for each state
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
across the country uh and in 2021 they
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
concluded that for every dollar of
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer contributions through employer
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
rates a net of
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
$610 of economic impact is made to the
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy uh which resulted
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
in 210 million uh paid back in federal
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
state and local taxes as well so these
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
are all contributing members of our um
 
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
society and our economy and uh again
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
they have not been provided with a fair
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
Cola over the years and I would like uh
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
this committee uh to look at the policy
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of this and determine whether or
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
not um you all think it's fair
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh for that to be the case and we'd ask
 
01:43:57.550 --> 01:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
for your full support of this uh to send
 
01:43:59.470 --> 01:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
it to the floor and subsequently to the
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee um with that I
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
recognize that there uh are a number of
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
retirement issues on the horizon uh I
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate this committee's uh due
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
diligence in taking a look at all of
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
this uh objectively and trying to be
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
fair to uh everyone that uh comes before
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
you and is looking for uh a fair shot at
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
a dignified retirement thank you and
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
questions good
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
Shu good morning Madam chair and uh
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
members of Edna I will tell you um my
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
name is Diane Shu and uh I formerly
 
01:44:59.070 --> 01:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
served on this committee for I think 11
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
years so I know this subject pretty well
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh I will tell you further that I was
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor of the only Cola bill
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
passed in recent memory in New Hampshire
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
that bill that passed in
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
2019 and the main reason I'm speaking in
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
support of this bill is because is like
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill that bill that passed in
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
2019 had a five-year look back you will
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
see in the um number one paragraph
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
people who've been retired for 60 months
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
or five years do not are not eligible
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
for this that was the case in 2019 also
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
so I would point out to you that that
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
group of people that we excluded in
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
2019 have now been without a cola for
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
over 10 years so that's what we're
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
hoping this can
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
overcome that particular Bill uh in 2019
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
happily enjoyed the support of Governor
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
sonunu because he could see the benefit
 
01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
to our public
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
retirees as well as the positive effect
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
on current Cent employees as we all know
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
that there's a retention difficulty for
 
01:46:32.109 --> 01:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
people who work for public
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
entities uh I can tell you myself I
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
retired in 2005 I'm coming up on my 20y
 
01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.669 align:start position:0%
retired in 2005 I'm coming up on my 20y
year

01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
anniversary and it gets tougher and
 
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
tougher to pay for my property taxes my
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
utilities the costs of food just
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
depending on my state pension
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
and Social Security uh I think we're all
 
01:46:59.470 --> 01:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
aware that those have not been
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
sufficient to even meet the costs of
 
01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
inflation um I will just further state
 
01:47:11.229 --> 01:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
that these folks all mostly spent their
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
careers working for you and me either in
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
our communities or for the state and
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
most of them are retired in New
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this money that comes to
 
01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
their pockets are is going to be spent
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's going to come back
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
into our economy to me that's a large
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
plus I think that's about all that I
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
have uh so that I'm not repeating what
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
other folks have said thank you very
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there any
 
01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.510 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there any
questions

01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yeah for the uh record
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%

I've a testif IED on this bill many
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
times I'm a state retiree myself fairly
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
recently and
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
um so but would not qualify of course
 
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
um I want what I wanted to tell you is
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
that this bill's gone through many times
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
and the last in most recent memory it
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
turned into a stien I'm happy to hear
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at the policy behind
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
it and not the financial matters so much
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
so I hope you pass this on to the

01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh fin the um retirement
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
system has had a good gain in the last
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
year according to the report and some of
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
those gains it would be nice if they
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
came back through and added to like a
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
cola fund i' like to not see us just pay
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
that $500 every time this comes up and
 
01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
actually start building
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
something um when this when it was 85
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
million the last time this went through
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
instead of a 100 million um you know it
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
seemed like there ought to be a way to
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
build up a cola account or something and
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
at least move this forward in some way
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
where you build that forward and just
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
not end up being you know a stien again
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh because I guess the legislature can
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
see the benefit of doing this but it's a
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's a big number to crack so
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
um that was we have
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
45,3 emplo uh retirees right now and
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
um that way you know it would
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully it would probably be done by
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of committee that would
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
determine how much they could do out in
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
colas and close to a line to this so I
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
hope we do something we move this
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
forward in finance as well in some way
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
and not just that number is too scary to
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
crack so
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
um that's what I basically wanted to say
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you good job is
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
536 all right seeing none I'm going to
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%

in my district and uh and with bills
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
like this in in fact all the bills we
 
03:15:37.229 --> 03:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
talk about have statewide significance
 
03:15:40.990 --> 03:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's also part of uh I think

03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
in history in um in in the New Hampshire
 
03:16:19.070 --> 03:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system and and uh and what
 
03:16:21.550 --> 03:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
this uh specific Bill uh is trying to
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish but I can give you a quick
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
sort of high level 30,000 foot viewpoint
 
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
on it but uh three years ago the
 
03:16:31.790 --> 03:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a bipartisan bill
 
03:16:34.590 --> 03:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
that corrected a long overdue issue uh
 
03:16:37.590 --> 03:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
with when at um uh group one members
 
03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
pension is recalculated to around 10% a
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
10% reduction for the rest of their
 
03:16:45.870 --> 03:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
retirement um uh years and the
 
03:16:48.830 --> 03:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislature Rec IED at the time that um
 
03:16:51.790 --> 03:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
65 years old was no longer the age at
 
03:16:53.710 --> 03:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
which group one employees reached their
 
03:16:56.110 --> 03:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
full Social Security age so there's some
 
03:16:58.910 --> 03:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
there was some Gap uh I I guess that
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
that had existed and when the
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
legislature updated the law to reflect
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
one's full social social security age it
 
03:17:08.910 --> 03:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
did not include a small slice of
 
03:17:12.389 --> 03:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
employees who had already retired uh but
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
had not yet turned their full Social
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
Security age and so it's a closed group
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
this isn't a group that's getting any
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
bigger it's probably going the other way
 
03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
um hopefully not very quickly but but uh
 
03:17:27.790 --> 03:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's a closed group of retirees that
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
should have been included but we're not
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's really what I have for
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
Testimony to introduce the bill and uh
 
03:17:39.150 --> 03:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
and hopefully uh any questions uh of any
 
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
any sort of technical nature can uh can
 
03:17:45.630 --> 03:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
fall on the uh U people behind me here
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have one non-technical
 
03:17:51.309 --> 03:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
question are have you seen the fiscal
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this bill we haven't I I
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
I I have seen some numbers on that I
 
03:18:01.150 --> 03:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
don't see that here but uh but I believe
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
the um uh actually a a constituent who
 
03:18:07.389 --> 03:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
brought this to um to to my attention as
 
03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
well as representative McDonald's
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
attention does have some fiscal Noe
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
information and uh and I think we'd be
 
03:18:15.389 --> 03:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
happy to uh to I'm sure share that with
 
03:18:17.590 --> 03:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
the committee okay thank thank
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Mr Greenland do
 
03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
you have the is the fiscal note
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%

03:18:27.550 --> 03:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
you could arrange to get us some copies
 
03:18:27.560 --> 03:18:31.590 align:start position:0%
you could arrange to get us some copies
of

03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.189 --> 03:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
it all right uh I only have one other
 
03:18:40.030 --> 03:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
Irwin what
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
surprise I have the fiscal part of oh
 
03:18:58.429 --> 03:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it kind of goes with the
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
history thank you very much for having
 
03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:14.070 --> 03:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.870 --> 03:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
perfect so for the record my name is
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
Karen Irwin and I am representing myself
 
03:20:08.429 --> 03:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
today and I worked with David luno on
 
03:20:11.950 --> 03:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill because it I'm one
 
03:20:14.349 --> 03:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
of the me and my husband are both one of
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
the people captured in this shortfall we
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
retired before July 1 2023 but we're as
 
03:20:24.229 --> 03:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
of the last bill this fiscal note
 
03:20:26.189 --> 03:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't address the number of people
 
03:20:29.189 --> 03:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
that are encapsulated in this um fiscal
 
03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
note but the prior year when it was put
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
in it was 3,000 individuals this won't
 
03:20:37.189 --> 03:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
be effective for another year so I
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
figured that number would go down
 
03:20:40.830 --> 03:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
because it's a finite group of people
 
03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's only till you reach your um they
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
down in people it's only until you reach
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
your so full Social Security age so
 
03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
um so anyhow what happened um was for
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
many years we' been putting in this bill
 
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the 10% because it has been
 
03:21:03.550 --> 03:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
a disparity for I want to say close to
 
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
20 years you know prior to a couple
 
03:21:09.870 --> 03:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
years ago and when um the fiscal note
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
was done by uh the retirement system
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
they defined members as active members
 
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
not retire re members even though the
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
language seemed to support it was for
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
retirees and um and so when that was
 
03:21:25.469 --> 03:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
done that left out a whole bunch of
 
03:21:27.550 --> 03:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
people that had retired prior to that
 
03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
date July 1st and had not reached a full
 
03:21:34.349 --> 03:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
retirement age So I myself will be
 
03:21:37.950 --> 03:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
turning 65 this year and I would get the
 
03:21:41.110 --> 03:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
decrease without this happening so I'll
 
03:21:43.950 --> 03:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
get the decrease as well 3,000 other
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
people as of last year um
 
03:21:50.670 --> 03:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
if you go to um page three I tried to
 
03:21:54.990 --> 03:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
illustrate that this is a a closed end
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
situation because a good share of us are
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
at anybody 1960 and um a birthday is
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
1960 up to like you know after that is
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
67 is full Social Security retirement
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
age that was always the situation that
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be when you get full
 
03:22:17.309 --> 03:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
retirement social sec security you get a
 
03:22:21.150 --> 03:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
dip in your pension so that equated it
 
03:22:23.790 --> 03:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
for most people anybody that retired
 
03:22:26.590 --> 03:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
after that um they will not have that
 
03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
dip at
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
65 um so as I put out you know it looks
 
03:22:37.710 --> 03:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
like to me in 1962 if your birthday was
 
03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:39.550 align:start position:0%
like to me in 1962 if your birthday was
81

03:22:39.550 --> 03:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
81
 
03:22:42.030 --> 03:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
1962 you would get because of the cut
 
03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
off of the fiscal year you get one month
 
03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
of benefit in 20 30 and
 
03:22:52.710 --> 03:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal note is written in a
 
03:22:56.990 --> 03:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
certain way that it it says they um
 
03:22:58.790 --> 03:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
based on the provisions of the bill will
 
03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
be amortized over a a 20-year period and
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
that the costs involved will go well
 
03:23:09.870 --> 03:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
beyond uh fiscal year 2028 and it really
 
03:23:12.990 --> 03:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't because of the age thing and
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know how people would retire and so
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what they're speaking of
 
03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
but um anyhow rais some questions
 
03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
because the year before fiscal note
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
which I've also included for your
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
information is showed in um 26 and 27
 
03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:37.110 align:start position:0%
information is showed in um 26 and 27
520,000

03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
520,000
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
um in those two years with a fiscal
 
03:23:43.189 --> 03:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
acred liability of
 
03:23:46.030 --> 03:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
11.1 you know our pensions going to go
 
03:23:48.189 --> 03:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
down by 10% it's just being delayed by
 
03:23:48.199 --> 03:23:49.269 align:start position:0%
down by 10% it's just being delayed by
two

03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:23:53.150 --> 03:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
years people like myself who have 36
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
years um in the system um I'm still we
 
03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a 7% goes into an account that's
 
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
ours and I'm still drawing down that
 
03:24:07.389 --> 03:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
account every payment that gets made is
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
drawn down from first from the employees
 
03:24:15.070 --> 03:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
7% it is a if I passed away it is an
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
amount that would go to my kids
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
not the pension just the amount that's
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:23.070 align:start position:0%
in that
7%

03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
7%
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
so so that would definitely delay any
 
03:24:28.910 --> 03:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
impact regarding you know that would
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
stretch it out till that money is all
 
03:24:33.309 --> 03:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
run down and most all of us would be
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
within that five to six years and it'd
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
be all
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
relative so in my case if I needed to um
 
03:24:43.710 --> 03:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
retire if because my pensions going down
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
by 10% if I needed that
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
you know absolutely had to live and
 
03:24:50.670 --> 03:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
needed that uh
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
$469 in this case um and I had to take
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
my Social Security early that would be a
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
decrease in my Social Security of
 
03:24:58.640 --> 03:25:00.550 align:start position:0%
decrease in my Social Security of
another

03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:25:03.389 --> 03:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
$377 so I would lose
 
03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
permanently because of those reasons I
 
03:25:07.189 --> 03:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
would lose
 
03:25:11.309 --> 03:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
$846 per month because of having to take
 
03:25:13.710 --> 03:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
my Social Security early because my
 
03:25:16.830 --> 03:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
pension went down early
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
so um we have a quite robust um you know
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system the returns have been
 
03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
good even in you know the end of June it
 
03:25:27.429 --> 03:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
was an
 
03:25:27.439 --> 03:25:28.990 align:start position:0%
was an
8.8%

03:25:28.990 --> 03:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
8.8%
 
03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
8.8%
return

03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
return
 
03:25:36.189 --> 03:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
um you know we we did uh the UN unfunded
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
liability for everybody else was 45
 
03:25:41.070 --> 03:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
million and that went into the
 
03:25:44.830 --> 03:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system and even if we could
 
03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
somehow use some of that money that
 
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to cover the costs
 
03:25:52.110 --> 03:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
because this is so ended it could be
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
really done almost in fiscal years not
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know drawing out on this acute
 
03:26:01.150 --> 03:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
liability situation because it
 
03:26:04.429 --> 03:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to reach 67 you know
 
03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
or so if you're the only people that
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be captured or a little
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
bit of people in 1958 and people born in
 
03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
1959 that retired before July 1st 202
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
23 um 10% of a pension is a lot for
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
um the uh they always look um at these
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
calculations as what is the
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
assumed interest rate uh which has been
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
6.75 for years and that was encompassed
 
03:26:42.550 --> 03:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the previous fiscal note and they
 
03:26:46.469 --> 03:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
earned 8.8 in the um Retirement System
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
just last year so if it could be used
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a funding source if that
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
could be used the you know the
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
percentage that gained over what
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
was deposited anyhow I uh respectfully
 
03:27:07.510 --> 03:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
request that the executive department um
 
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
and administration approves this small
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
investment that doesn't significantly
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
detract from the public or private
 
03:27:21.150 --> 03:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
sector uh it is a relatively small
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
amount of money the fiscal note reflects
 
03:27:26.429 --> 03:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
its 13 million where last year it was
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
11.1 for the acred liability I'm still
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
not getting the expenditure
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
relationship for dragging it out for 20
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
years for um something that ends in
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
probably um I would think would end
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
in in State fiscal year
 
03:27:48.479 --> 03:27:51.030 align:start position:0%
in in State fiscal year
2030

03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
2030
 
03:27:53.309 --> 03:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
um I would estimate that it would be
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
very few people so I'm not sure how in
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
2028 when most of the people will be
 
03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
have reached full retirement you know
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
most of the people in 1960 will have
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
reached full
 
03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
retirement and if they retired before
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
July 1 2023 that's pretty early
 
03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
retirement so I hope you look at the
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
policy of this and approve this forward
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
to finance and let them figure out the
 
03:28:26.309 --> 03:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
numbers but um I appreciate your time
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I would welcome any questions all
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
right thank you are there any
 
03:28:34.990 --> 03:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions vers GL um thank you madam
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here um
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that in I'm still
 
03:28:41.189 --> 03:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
relatively new to this area you
 
03:28:43.630 --> 03:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned the individual account is
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
there a specifically earmarked
 
03:28:47.510 --> 03:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
individual account that then goes to
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
your heirs yes and then the impact of
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
that I guess I'll ask the the the the
 
03:28:56.429 --> 03:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
retirement about the impact if we were
 
03:28:59.550 --> 03:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
to take it directly from there um S no
 
03:29:03.189 --> 03:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
no it the that account does not directly
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
go to her heirs it is first used to pay
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
the pension okay and if there's if she
 
03:29:11.309 --> 03:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
is so unfortunate it's to die before she
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
uses it up then then it would go to my
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
ears correct but the expectation is that
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
you will live long enough to empty that
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
completely out yeah yeah it takes five
 
03:29:22.870 --> 03:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
or six years to empty it out in my
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular case it was 304 thou
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
um, and I just pointing that out that
 
03:29:32.150 --> 03:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know we'd be using that a little
 
03:29:34.349 --> 03:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
faster but it still kicks the ball down
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
the field a little bit you know
 
03:29:39.389 --> 03:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
regarding the um unfunded liability is
 
03:29:41.309 --> 03:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to point out so thank
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
you when I was listening I misunderstood
 
03:29:44.750 --> 03:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
what you were saying so I appreciate the
 
03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
clarity yeah okay any other
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
03:29:50.279 --> 03:29:51.429 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
thank

03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:30:12.189 --> 03:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:15.309 --> 03:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
637 yes I think the retirement system
 
03:30:20.750 --> 03:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
issue well our point of view is we're
 
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
neutral you look like you just got asked
 
03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
to the principal's office yeah well well
 
03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there are a lot of
 
03:30:35.229 --> 03:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
people who don't quite understand this
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
aspect of the law right so maybe I'll
 
03:30:41.349 --> 03:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
speak first to the members
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
account so member
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
contributions are put in account in the
 
03:30:46.560 --> 03:30:47.590 align:start position:0%
contributions are put in account in the
member's

03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
member's
 
03:30:51.710 --> 03:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
name they are uh allocated interest once
 
03:30:51.720 --> 03:30:52.590 align:start position:0%
name they are uh allocated interest once
a

03:30:52.590 --> 03:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
year um based on the
 
03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
2% less than the actual rate of no of
 
03:31:07.510 --> 03:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
the assumed rate of return or the actual
 
03:31:10.030 --> 03:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
rate of return so it can range from zero
 
03:31:10.040 --> 03:31:11.710 align:start position:0%
rate of return so it can range from zero
to

03:31:11.710 --> 03:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:31:14.469 --> 03:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
4.75% that member account builds up at
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
any time the member terminates service
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
without taking a pension they can
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
request for that account to be
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
distributed to them or rolled over to a
 
03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
401K with the
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
interest once a member
 
03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
retires we then calculate their pension
 
03:31:34.110 --> 03:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
and split it into two portions the
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
member annuity and the state annuity the
 
03:31:38.469 --> 03:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
member annuity is the amount of the
 
03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
benefit that can be funded with the
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
member's contribution
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
account and the state annuity
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
is a remainder of the annuity that's
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
paid from the state accumulation fund
 
03:31:51.910 --> 03:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
which is made up of employer
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
contributions and investment
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
earnings uh to the extent the investment
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
earnings hav't been used to pay interest
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
to the member accounts um on
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
average that's about a 50 50 split there
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
are outliers depending on how your
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
career went someone went out on
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
disability work related disability in
 
03:32:17.950 --> 03:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
the first month of working then 95% of
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
their benefits going to be funded by the
 
03:32:22.150 --> 03:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
state fund because they've only made
 
03:32:24.030 --> 03:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
contributions for a month so you know
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
there are outliers but on average that's
 
03:32:30.189 --> 03:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
50% so when a member
 
03:32:33.630 --> 03:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
retires um we start paying their
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
pension and we reduce dollar for dooll
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
their member account by the amount of
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
the pension so uh that gets
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
reduced if they were to pass away
 
03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
without leaving a Survivor beneficiary
 
03:32:50.670 --> 03:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
and there was still money in that
 
03:32:53.309 --> 03:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
account it would go to a name
 
03:32:55.950 --> 03:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
beneficiary as the prior speaker said it
 
03:32:57.550 --> 03:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
was like five years it's it's somewhere
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
between five and seven years to
 
03:33:04.189 --> 03:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
um uh to exhaust a member's account
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
there is a alternative benefit you could
 
03:33:08.950 --> 03:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
pick where your current benefit would be
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
a little bit less but it would stretch
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
out that time that the member account
 
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
would be exhausted um some people opt
 
03:33:18.630 --> 03:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
for that because of their own personal
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances and life
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
expectancies um but most people just
 
03:33:25.870 --> 03:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
it's dollar for dollar so after about
 
03:33:28.030 --> 03:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
six seven eight years your membership
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
count is gone and then your benefit is
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
funded through the state annuity from
 
03:33:34.950 --> 03:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
that point on the state annuity
 
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
accumulation fund from that point on as
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
well as any Survivor benefit that you
 
03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
may have left for a spouse or or or or
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
another person so that's how the member
 
03:33:47.309 --> 03:33:47.319 align:start position:0%
account works this not like a 401k
 
03:33:49.710 --> 03:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
account hey it's my money and I invest
 
03:33:52.630 --> 03:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
it and then I take it when I want after
 
03:33:55.550 --> 03:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
I uh terminate employment it's it's
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
there and it's your money and you always
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
get it for instance we have several
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions in our statute where we
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
offset a pension for workers comp for uh
 
03:34:09.070 --> 03:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
excess earnings by someone who's on
 
03:34:13.870 --> 03:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
disability for a retiree who exceeds the
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh limit on
 
03:34:19.469 --> 03:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
ours those offsets are limited to the
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
state portion of their annuity we never
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
offset or cut back the member portion of
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
the annuity funded by their account
 
03:34:28.349 --> 03:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
because that was their
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
money um so it is distinct in that
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
respect but once you
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
retire kind of loses that separateness
 
03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
because the money is actually taken from
 
03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
your account and paid over to the state
 
03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
annuity accumulation fund at that point
 
03:34:46.030 --> 03:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
and you maintain this book entry as you
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
wind it down just in case you were to
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
pass away before it was exhausted
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
there'd be some residual amounts
 
03:34:54.269 --> 03:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
distributable to a
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
beneficiary um with that i' take any
 
03:34:58.189 --> 03:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions on that
 
03:34:58.199 --> 03:34:59.950 align:start position:0%
questions on that
issue

03:34:59.950 --> 03:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:35:01.990 --> 03:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
y thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
for explaining that I was wondering if
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
there was a way to do something like
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
that with this bill but I'm happy to
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
hear that there's already that that draw
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
down on the member account so thank you
 
03:35:14.349 --> 03:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
for the clarity you're welcome any other
 
03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
questions rep
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
scitech uh you said the member account
 
03:35:23.070 --> 03:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
goes down I wasn't that to terminally
 
03:35:25.309 --> 03:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
fund their retirement that it was I
 
03:35:27.269 --> 03:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
thought the terminal funding of the
 
03:35:29.309 --> 03:35:29.319 align:start position:0%
retirement would be in two pieces a
 
03:35:31.710 --> 03:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
state piece and a member piece how does
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
a member member contrib uh account go
 
03:35:38.189 --> 03:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
down well like I said the the member
 
03:35:40.110 --> 03:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
account is transferred to the state
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
annuity accumulation fund and that's
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
what pays the pension however maintain
 
03:35:47.469 --> 03:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
mainin a book
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
entry so that uh that reduces the
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
pension reduces the account by the
 
03:35:56.429 --> 03:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
amount of your pension paid in the event
 
03:35:59.309 --> 03:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
that you were to pass away prior to that
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
being fully exhausted because that was
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
your money whatever is remaining in that
 
03:36:07.229 --> 03:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
account would be distributable to your
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
beneficiary so that you always get the
 
03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
full benefit either in terms of in form
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
of an uh an annuity benefit or a refund
 
03:36:20.110 --> 03:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
of accumulated or distribution of
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
accumulated contributions you always get
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
the full benefit of your member
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
interests thank you mother all right I
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
think settle that little all right
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
question nothing
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
further representative Leon has while
 
03:36:40.150 --> 03:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you while you're here um
 
03:36:42.670 --> 03:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to confirm that this would
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
entirely close um the the over s and we
 
03:36:48.670 --> 03:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be coming back would we be
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
coming back in the future with a bill
 
03:36:51.790 --> 03:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
like this for any other group of people
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this I do not believe
 
03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
so I think this just captures the people
 
03:37:00.189 --> 03:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
who were in between the two old and new
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
benchmarks going forward there's just
 
03:37:04.110 --> 03:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
going to be one Benchmark you're before
 
03:37:08.590 --> 03:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
or after it so that was the intent thank
 
03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
you um I have a question
 
03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
would If This Were to pass and someone
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
had reached their full retirement age
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
and the pension was reset prior to its
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
effective date would they still would
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
they get a
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
change uh I can't answer that off the
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
top of my head but could you make a note
 
03:37:31.800 --> 03:37:32.550 align:start position:0%
top of my head but could you make a note
of

03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
that U we can get an answer for you I I
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I did not participate in
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill or consult on it okay
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
yes I was wondering if it it was
 
03:37:54.189 --> 03:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
not yeah okay thank you that's very
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
important your full retirement and
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
beened it go up you
 
03:38:05.550 --> 03:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.510 --> 03:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you very much
 
03:38:17.950 --> 03:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
and is the uh fiscal note that we got is
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
in fact correct that it's
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
um what is it uh 7 700,000 and for the
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's a fairly nominal amount
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
you does anyone else wish to testify on
 
03:38:51.590 --> 03:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I'll close the
 
03:38:53.239 --> 03:39:14.349 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I'll close the
public

03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%

okay for the committee you've each
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
received a the latest copy of the
 
03:58:52.149 --> 03:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
statutory Provisions for the retirement
 
03:58:55.149 --> 03:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
system this is the 24 Edition which
 
03:58:58.229 --> 03:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
replaces the 23 Edition that's in in in
 
03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
the office
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a quick reference guide I trust
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
handy okay and it being
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
2:00 I'm opening the hearing on House
 
03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 581 one I will mention that uh I am
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
questions I call the prime sponsor
 
03:59:26.479 --> 03:59:28.510 align:start position:0%
questions I call the prime sponsor
representative

03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you madam chairman members
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
is Dan Maguire I represent the town of
 
03:59:39.550 --> 03:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
Epsom um our current uh State retirement
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
system is
 
03:59:44.070 --> 03:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
Antiquated it's it's a form called
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
called a defined benefit pension plan
 
03:59:52.229 --> 03:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
and that form of of retirement system
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
has essentially disappeared from the
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
private sector altogether and many
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
places in the public sector as well for
 
04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
example UNH keen and
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
Plymouth roughly I think it's about 30
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
years ago uh switched from their defined
 
04:00:14.189 --> 04:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
um benefit plan to a defined
 
04:00:17.910 --> 04:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
contribution Pension Plan um and as a
 
04:00:22.349 --> 04:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
result they have no debt no pension debt
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and from what I can I've talked to
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
the the chancellor about it and they're
 
04:00:30.269 --> 04:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
very happy with with what they did on
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
the other hand the state has uh
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
something over5 billion doar including
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal but uh worth of pension debt
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
and you know it's it's theor Ally being
 
04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
fixed over time but I'll talk about
 
04:00:50.429 --> 04:00:50.439 align:start position:0%
there's been some some problems along
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
the way um I handed out an awful lot of
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
information and I'm I'm just going to
 
04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
try to hit the highlights and not you
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
know go into too much detail until we
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
get to questions so let's talk about um
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
the main difference between a defined
 
04:01:08.189 --> 04:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
benefit plan and a defined contribution
 
04:01:11.710 --> 04:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
plan Define contribution plan is really
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
really simple it's it's a savings
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
account that's that's it so when when uh
 
04:01:20.429 --> 04:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
money goes into that account as someone
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
is working some of the money just like
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
the other plans some comes from the
 
04:01:27.630 --> 04:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
employer some come from the employee it
 
04:01:29.710 --> 04:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
goes into a savings account the account
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
is invested it earns money taxfree and
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
then later when the person retires they
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
can withdraw money from their account a
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
Define Benefit Plan um similarly gets
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
money from the employer and the employee
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
but it promises the
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
employee uh a certain fixed payment
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
based on a on a formula and um so if
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
they work X number of years um X and and
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
their their um final compensation goes
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
into the equation and that creates a
 
04:02:05.830 --> 04:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
number and they would be paid that that
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
amount for the rest of their life the
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
problem is um the the defined benefit
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
plan the kind we have now
 
04:02:17.550 --> 04:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
is is poor in the presence of
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
inflation right um I'm working on the
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
budget right now we're using 2019 as a
 
04:02:26.070 --> 04:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
as kind of a base to of comparison sort
 
04:02:30.149 --> 04:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
of preco and in the six years since 2019
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
there's been 25%
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
inflation right so um plus 4% population
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
growth in New Hampshire so um so can you
 
04:02:43.870 --> 04:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
can imagine if you're getting 25% in
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
inflation over 6 years what's it going
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
to be over the 20 plus years that
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has retired right so the you
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
know the value of their pension is going
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
down and down over time
 
04:03:02.110 --> 04:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
whereas um a defined contribution plan
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
that has savings those savings can be in
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
assets that that increase uh with
 
04:03:11.309 --> 04:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
inflation mostly typically stocks or
 
04:03:13.870 --> 04:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
real estate things like that so it it's
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
better position to to keep up with
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
inflation secondly um the current kind
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
plan we have has 10year vesting so
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
someone has to work for 10 years um
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
before they're eligible to receive the
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
pension and many many do not we'll get
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
into exactly how many in a moment but um
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
whereas a defined contribution plan is
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
immediately vested there's no vesting
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
it's a savings account
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's completely portable
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
so if someone works for a short period
 
04:03:53.950 --> 04:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
of time uh one year two years Etc they
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
get to keep that that amount and um it's
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
portable to their future future
 
04:04:00.040 --> 04:04:01.550 align:start position:0%
portable to their future future
employers

04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
employers
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
um I I for example my first job was for
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
the University of
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
California um in the late 80s and uh
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
they were preed enough to have a defined
 
04:04:15.189 --> 04:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
contribution plan plan so I only work
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
for them for four years but I still have
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
the savings that you know have grown
 
04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
over the succeeding what 40 years I
 
04:04:25.950 --> 04:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
guess they're close to a 30 30 something
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
years all right um again the so this uh
 
04:04:34.229 --> 04:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit plan the benefits end
 
04:04:37.630 --> 04:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
when the retiree passes
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
away um or sometimes that or you can set
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
it up so the retire your spouse right um
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
but but it's not inheritable so if the
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
person dies young the benefits they
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
earned go back into the plan right
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
whereas again a savings account is their
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
own money it can be inherited by the
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
person's erors if the person passes away
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately too young it's their
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
money right goes to their HS um all
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
right so the other thing that's not
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
maybe readily uh apparent is that a
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan works essentially
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
by by guesswork there's there's which
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
you hire expensive actuaries to tell you
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the future and
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
you save as much as you need now to sort
 
04:05:35.790 --> 04:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
of reach your
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
goal then and the problem is predicting
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
the future is extremely difficult and
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll show you the more detail in a
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
moment but whereas um a defined
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
contribution plan because it's a savings
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
account because it it works the way the
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
money actually um earns so so it's
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
obvious to the person who's saving that
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
they want to put in as much as possible
 
04:06:07.710 --> 04:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
as as early as possible they want to
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
save when they're young right whereas
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
the key if you're in a defined benefit
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
plan the key to getting a good a better
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
retirement is what you earn at the end
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
not what you've saved at the beginning
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
right but what's actually in the plan is
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
based on what you saved at the beginning
 
04:06:30.990 --> 04:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
so so a Define um contribution plan
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
matches reality in a better way if you
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
if you see what I mean I I can answer
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
questions about that all right so and
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
then what is the advantage for the state
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
so so this for the state um it a defined
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh contribution plan makes it so that we
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
cannot get into debt right it's a
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
savings plan we put in money as the
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
employee is working that's the end of
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
the state's obligation right whereas a
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
Define Benefit Plan um we have we can
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
get into debt because those guesses as
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
to what's going to happen in the future
 
04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
can be wrong as they have been and and
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
um therefore future taxpayers have to
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
pay the expenses of today's
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
employees and that's simply wrong right
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
today's taxpayers should pay the
 
04:07:30.070 --> 04:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
expenses of today's employees so uh it
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
avoids debt and debt is a killer as
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to you know probably find
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
out at the federal level sometime not
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
too long from now all right let's talk
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
about the bill so what the bill does do
 
04:07:47.229 --> 04:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
is a very very small step for a very
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
small number of employees to just get us
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
started on on a defined contribution
 
04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
system so first of all it only affects
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
group one employees who are state
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
employees it has nothing to do with
 
04:08:04.349 --> 04:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees it doesn't affect
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
Police and Fire group two employees it's
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
just group one state employees and it
 
04:08:12.510 --> 04:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
only affects new ones ones who were not
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
yet hired right so the ones who will be
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
hired from when the bill passes assuming
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's July 1st from that point forward
 
04:08:22.830 --> 04:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
well guess what we're probably in a
 
04:08:24.510 --> 04:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze now because we're very
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
short of money so this is going to
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
affect very very few people until you
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
know as time goes on so so it's it's a
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
very slow growing small step type of
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
thing um the costs of the of the plan
 
04:08:43.309 --> 04:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
are the same as as group one now from
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
the the employees point of view both in
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
group one now and in this plan the
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
employee puts in 7% of their salary um
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
the the bill uh as written we had the
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
very similar bill here two years ago and
 
04:09:03.550 --> 04:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
so what's in this bill is the same as
 
04:09:06.070 --> 04:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
this committee uh came up with in their
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee process so that has sets
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
the employer rate at
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
5% that's something you can think about
 
04:09:18.389 --> 04:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
and change if you if you felt like it um
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's I believe that's a little bit
 
04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
higher than what the the state is
 
04:09:26.109 --> 04:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
currently paying on on group one um
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
plans but it's it's more in line with
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
what you see in the private sector in
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
the private sector frequently there's
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a match between the
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
employer puts in X and the employee puts
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the same right that kind of thing so
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay um the the plan is set up to be run
 
04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
exactly by the same board as our current
 
04:09:50.910 --> 04:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation Plan that's known
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
as a 457 plan we have a the state has a
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
plan where employees can put extra money
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
into savings tax deferred very similar
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
to an IRA um and that plan currently has
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
about a billion dollars in it um and it
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
had one employee who just recently
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
retired so they're looking for somebody
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
to replace but but that's how simple
 
04:10:18.030 --> 04:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
that plan is it's it's really doesn't
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
have much
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
overhead um and then the unfunded
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
liability uh associated with the current
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
plan um would still be charged to the
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
employer to this employer to the state
 
04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
for these employees so so these
 
04:10:36.670 --> 04:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
employees which we're going to call
 
04:10:42.189 --> 04:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
group three would count as um as part of
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability calculation so
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change that at all um
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
whether they're group one or group three
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
they would still be part of of payments
 
04:10:55.389 --> 04:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
for the unfunded liability all right and
 
04:10:59.790 --> 04:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the basics um I'll if you turn
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
the page here I already talked about
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
inflation a bit um so this plan are
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble hiring because the
 
04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan is very
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
unattractive to today's
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
employees and there's two ways of
 
04:11:19.389 --> 04:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
looking at it one is this first section
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
here number of jobs held in a lifetime
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
so according to the um uh Bureau of
 
04:11:25.239 --> 04:11:26.389 align:start position:0%
so according to the um uh Bureau of
Labor

04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
Statistics um the average person uh born
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
in 57 through 64 that's kind of my age
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
um has 12.7
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
jobs by the time they're 56 that's the
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
average right so some of them are having
 
04:11:46.109 --> 04:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
20 jobs or 24 jobs or something crazy
 
04:11:48.750 --> 04:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
like that right they're not they're not
 
04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
sticking to a single job which is where
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
a defined benefit plan would would have
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
some some Merit right so they're they're
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
typically uh you know we're talking
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
about they stay in a job for a few years
 
04:12:03.790 --> 04:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
and then they switch so portability is a
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
big thing for today's employees and then
 
04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
the similar thing if you if you go down
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
there very few people in this group so
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about regular state
 
04:12:18.550 --> 04:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
employees group one state employees um
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
very few of them Reach the 10-year uh
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
Mark right so very few of them get
 
04:12:27.070 --> 04:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
vested in the current plan so that means
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
they're giving up on benefits that they
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
have earned for themselves because
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
they're not staying for 10 years and I
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
had what I had in the back of my mind
 
04:12:40.349 --> 04:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
that it was maybe 50% but the actual
 
04:12:42.030 --> 04:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
numbers from the New Hampshire
 
04:12:45.149 --> 04:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
retirement system that I got is much
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
much uh lower than that so so even after
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
just five years um 61% are gone of the
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
people that are H you know 61% of
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
employees who are hired last less than
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
five years um and and if you go forward
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
with these calculations it's something
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
like just over a quarter around
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
30% who reach 10 years right so so so
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
this plan that we have now doesn't work
 
04:13:20.189 --> 04:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
for 70% of these employees so it's no
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
wonder we have trouble hiring right so
 
04:13:27.550 --> 04:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
okay um I think I will oh and I wanted
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
to say something about um the ability of
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
the retirement system to to predict the
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
last page here you see this page that
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
looks like a giant spreadsheet right
 
04:13:41.790 --> 04:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
that has big list of numbers so at the
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
time that the leg ISL finally figured
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
out that the retirement system had a had
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
a debt problem was around 2008 here and
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh that's when we got on the 30-year
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
plan to to fix it right and so this is a
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
piece of paper they got from the
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system that said if you
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
follow our plan you will pay off your
 
04:14:06.319 --> 04:14:07.790 align:start position:0%
follow our plan you will pay off your
unfunded

04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
liability uh by this uh 2039 right in 30
 
04:14:15.189 --> 04:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
years and so look at the ability to
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
predict right if we go down this table
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
to 2025 today this table said they
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
predicted back then that our current
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability right now would be
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
3.125 billion well guess what it's
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
5.3 five 5.2 billion I think is what the
 
04:14:36.030 --> 04:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
latest number is so it's two billion
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
more than than what was predicted then
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
so the the ability just because
 
04:14:42.269 --> 04:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's an actuary and they're
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
probably the best best at predicting
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they necessarily get stuff
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
right and so um that's the problem with
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
with the current kind of plan so um I
 
04:14:53.880 --> 04:14:55.349 align:start position:0%
with the current kind of plan so um I
think

04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
that's that should be enough and I'm
 
04:14:59.590 --> 04:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
BR thank
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
you I thank you for your passion on this
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
subject um but my understanding is that
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we have
 
04:15:17.710 --> 04:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
trouble having people come to New
 
04:15:21.790 --> 04:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that they've lost trust in
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the pension system because it's
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
continuously monkeyed around with in
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
legislation so how is it that this plan
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
won't have the same problem yes thank
 
04:15:33.309 --> 04:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
question I think it's because again this
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
plan is a simple savings plan it doesn't
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
have features in the same way it doesn't
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
have I mean clearly the the the
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislature could decide well instead of
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
7% the employes should put in 8% or
 
04:15:54.269 --> 04:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
should put in you know those kind of
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
things but but it's not um the number of
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
years to get to a to get to a pension
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
the multiplier of the pension what's
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
considered part of income and not part
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
of in all those kind of things that
 
04:16:11.149 --> 04:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
people play with in the current plan
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
really aren't a problem in in this kind
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
of plan and and if they are they don't
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
affect the past you see what I mean cuz
 
04:16:22.590 --> 04:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
cuz what we do sometimes when we make a
 
04:16:25.229 --> 04:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
change we're making a change to the
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
whole system and it includes changing
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
what the expectations were from the day
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
somebody started until to until now you
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
see what I mean whereas in a savings
 
04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
plan everything that happened from when
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
the day somebody started until now is
 
04:16:44.189 --> 04:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
still there it's still there in savings
 
04:16:46.750 --> 04:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
so even if you make a change somehow to
 
04:16:49.710 --> 04:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
what's going forward it doesn't affect
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
the past and so it's the early Savings
 
04:16:55.950 --> 04:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
in a pension plan that really make the
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
bulk of the of somebody's
 
04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
pension representative sers yeah thank
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um most 401ks an an
 
04:17:09.389 --> 04:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
example are vested I mean so they they
 
04:17:11.790 --> 04:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
work for two three four years five years
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
and then they're 100 p 100% fested are
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
you saying at this point the the money
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
the state puts in at 5% is going to be
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
their money from day one if they retired
 
04:17:27.109 --> 04:17:27.119 align:start position:0%
or quit yes thank you for the question
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
we could have put a one-year vesting or
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
something like that but the way the
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
Bill's written it's it's essentially
 
04:17:36.510 --> 04:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
immediately vested so um if somebody is
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
only works for six months they get six
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
months worth of that that money I it
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
just seems simpler to us you guys could
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
certainly change that you know
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
representative long um so I take your
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
point about it being harder turn on your
 
04:17:54.429 --> 04:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
microphone so I I see your point about
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
it being harder to hire younger
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
employees uh because of the current
 
04:18:02.349 --> 04:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
system but uh since a defined
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
contribution system would primarily be
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial to younger employes I guess
 
04:18:12.030 --> 04:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
would it be harder than to hire uh mid
 
04:18:14.429 --> 04:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
or later career employees who don't get
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
as much of a benefit from uh having uh
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
returns acrew for as long a time on
 
04:18:20.800 --> 04:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
returns acrew for as long a time on
their

04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:18:23.670 --> 04:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
contribution all right thank you for
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
that question but I I actually think
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's the other way around I know a
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people who have um joined State
 
04:18:34.630 --> 04:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
service toward the end of their careers
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
right um and so only don't get to 10
 
04:18:40.590 --> 04:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
years friend of mine is about to retire
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
after eight years right so
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
so the benefits she's earned over that
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
eight years toward the end of her career
 
04:18:52.109 --> 04:18:52.119 align:start position:0%
is is essentially lost I mean they get
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
they get back their own contribution and
 
04:18:55.590 --> 04:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
they get back a little bit from the
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
state contribution but they don't get
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what that would have earned over
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
that period of time if you see what I
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
mean so somebody who comes into State
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
service later in life probably already
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
has a 401k an IRA whatever and so this
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
would would accumulate or add to it if
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
you see what I
 
04:19:20.349 --> 04:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
mean Howard uh thank you for taking my
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
question I know that you mentioned uh
 
04:19:25.870 --> 04:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
portability and uh how many jobs the
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
average American Works uh over over
 
04:19:30.109 --> 04:19:30.119 align:start position:0%
their lifetime I was just wondering if
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
you had more statistics on how that
 
04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
related to New Hampshire uh like
 
04:19:38.070 --> 04:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
preferably our state employee turnover
 
04:19:40.109 --> 04:19:40.119 align:start position:0%
rate per se yes thank you for the
 
04:19:44.070 --> 04:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
question the the best I have is on that
 
04:19:48.189 --> 04:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
page um the the paragraph that says
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
starts with the nhrs actuaries assume
 
04:19:55.870 --> 04:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
the following so it tells you that um
 
04:19:55.880 --> 04:19:57.389 align:start position:0%
the following so it tells you that um
only

04:19:57.389 --> 04:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
73% last a year of people that we hire
 
04:20:05.309 --> 04:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
in this group uh the next year another
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
you know 21% leave the next year another
 
04:20:11.149 --> 04:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
15% leave like that right so those are
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers that I got I did not get
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
these recently by the way I got these
 
04:20:19.229 --> 04:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
from Mr Carlin before he retired two
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
years ago so they may not be 100%
 
04:20:24.189 --> 04:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
accurate but but I'm sure they're
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
different long is there any data
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
available on as what the attrition rate
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
of state employees would be uh if there
 
04:20:39.830 --> 04:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't this 10year vesting
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
requirement uh specifically I'm
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if people choose to stay
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
longer because of that
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
requirement yeah that's a good
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
question obviously not many are staying
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
that much longer right I mean if we're
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
only getting leaving 27% are getting to
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
10 years so so I it can't be a very big
 
04:21:02.349 --> 04:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
um thing
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I but I don't know of any particular
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
studies or something like
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
that other questions so Madam chair I I
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
handed out two other things that I
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
should I should mention one is um
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
testimony from representative Wier about
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
his own experience he had both a defined
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
contribution and a defined benefit plan
 
04:21:28.630 --> 04:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
um and he can't be here today and the
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
other one is an
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I heard from the Department
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services yesterday and
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's a section of the bill which is
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
essentially the last paragraph in the
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill so if you go to uh
 
04:21:46.510 --> 04:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
um almost the last paragraph you go to
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
page four line
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
19 um so what administrative Services I
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
my intention with this bill was not to
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
change anything related to health right
 
04:22:03.630 --> 04:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
we we have a health retiree Health uh
 
04:22:05.950 --> 04:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
coverage and and I didn't want you know
 
04:22:07.950 --> 04:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
I wanted it to be exactly the same as
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
what group one currently gets and so
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
that was the intention of this paragraph
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
that's on line 19 and apparently
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
administrative Services it's not written
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
correctly and so that's what this
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is for it's to fix it so that
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um retiree health is the same for group
 
04:22:31.710 --> 04:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
one and and group three and um it's much
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
more it's long but it's much more
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
understandable because basically in the
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
retire Health language it takes every
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
place where it says group one and says
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
group one or group three right so so
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
they would both be the
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
same all right thank you very much
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me we have another question
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
Howard yeah sorry about that thank you
 
04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
so much for taking my question uh you
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
brought up a point that that kind of
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
sparked something uh so something that
 
04:23:02.349 --> 04:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
you mentioned here on your uh your sheet
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh and handout it says that it only
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
affects new group one employees uh so I
 
04:23:08.910 --> 04:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
understand that we're if we're not
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
trying to combine groups one and two uh
 
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
why are we going for group three here
 
04:23:14.680 --> 04:23:15.950 align:start position:0%
why are we going for group three here
just

04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:23:19.229 --> 04:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
to you mean why is it called group three
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
or because there will be I if I
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
understand your question it's because
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
there are existing group one employees
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
who will stay in group one right so and
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
plus there's a lot of Municipal
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
Employees who this doesn't cover right
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
so this is just about state employees so
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
right now in the retirement system um
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
20% of the of the members are state
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
employees and 80% are municipal and and
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
School Employees right so this is not
 
04:23:54.630 --> 04:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
about that set this is about only the
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
the state employees and again only the
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
ones who will be hired in the future so
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
we tried to make this I mean this is
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a big change right I mean it's a
 
04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's a big thing and and we so we wanted
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
to start you know this big right so so
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
this is as small a group as I can think
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
of and it's the group that would most
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you other
 
04:24:22.590 --> 04:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you madam
 
04:24:31.229 --> 04:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.910 --> 04:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon for the record again
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm Mark Kavanaugh Deputy counsel in
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
compliance officer from New Hampshire
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
retirement system and here with me is
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
Diana kryon another attorney in our
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
department who's helping me fill in for
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
Marty and she's there to poke me in the
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
side when I say something
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
wrong but hopefully that will be
 
04:24:59.760 --> 04:25:01.429 align:start position:0%
wrong but hopefully that will be
never

04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
never
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we just yesterday received the report
 
04:25:05.520 --> 04:25:06.469 align:start position:0%
um we just yesterday received the report
from

04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
GRS and so the fiscal note was not
 
04:25:11.710 --> 04:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
prepared but we did put together a bill
 
04:25:11.720 --> 04:25:12.830 align:start position:0%
prepared but we did put together a bill
brief

04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
brief
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
I distributed earlier that contains uh
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
essentially what we would put in the
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal not worksheet that will be
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
sending to LBA
 
04:25:25.469 --> 04:25:25.479 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um I just wanted to ask whether
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
you wanted to talk about the legal
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
considerations or the financial
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
considerations first and let me premise
 
04:25:35.229 --> 04:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
any of my comments by saying that we
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
this is a policy issue whether it's a
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
good idea to have a DC plan or not and
 
04:25:44.910 --> 04:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh NH HR is neutral on that policy
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
decision but we are here to explain
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
potential Financial impact and to point
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
out a few technical uh and
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
administrative issues that
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
we see in the current bill unless there
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
are specific questions it looks to me
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
like the legal issues are
 
04:26:09.149 --> 04:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
mostly unclear or uh Lang unclear
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
language or places where we need to
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
specify are there any questions
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I have a question
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
for you your board of directors two
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and this similar bill came in
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
a policy position that rejected this
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill and did something that the
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
retirement system generally never does
 
04:26:27.389 --> 04:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
and came out in opposition to that
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislation has that board reviewed this
 
04:26:33.149 --> 04:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh no it has not but uh that was a
 
04:26:35.710 --> 04:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
different piece of legislation so not
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay not by much but okay is the board
 
04:26:39.790 --> 04:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
going to review this to make a
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
determination whether they want to set a
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
position or not the legislative
 
04:26:45.790 --> 04:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
committee is meeting shortly and that
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
would be something that they consider
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so as I said unless
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
there's any specific questions about the
 
04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
langu language details we'll leave that
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um okay and then you can
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
give give the the whole committee the uh
 
04:27:05.229 --> 04:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
the dollar
 
04:27:08.109 --> 04:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
issues all right so under Financial
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
considerations and this is where the
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
cost enters into it it's in the the
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
upper table you see the projected
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
increase in employer
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
contributions in other words the 5% that
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
the employer would be paying plus the UA
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
that the employer would be paying the
 
04:27:33.750 --> 04:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
employer the the employer being the
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
state uh with respect to group one
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
members who become eligible in the plan
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
that is those hired after 71
 
04:27:43.479 --> 04:27:45.429 align:start position:0%
that is those hired after 71
25

04:27:45.429 --> 04:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
25
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
lower table shows the savings by the
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
employer not making contributions
 
04:28:00.030 --> 04:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
to NH HRS for these
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
employees as active
 
04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
members and you'll notice there's a
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
difference uh in 2026 3.3 million versus
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
1.6 million it's one and then in uh 2027
 
04:28:19.389 --> 04:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
6.2 versus
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
3 and fiscal year 28 8.8 versus
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
4.3 and you say what why why why is that
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
different well under the new plan the
 
04:28:32.910 --> 04:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
employer will be paying
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
5% plus the
 
04:28:39.149 --> 04:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
UA the state will for these people under
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
the existing plan the employer pays the
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
employer share of the normal cost which
 
04:28:45.239 --> 04:28:46.550 align:start position:0%
employer share of the normal cost which
is

04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:28:48.750 --> 04:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
2.4% plus the
 
04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
UA so the new plan would
 
04:28:57.630 --> 04:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
require employers to pay more because
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's nonua portion of its contribution
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
5% whereas the nonua portion of
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
contributions to nhrs is for the normal
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
cost of 2.42 so that's why you see that
 
04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
difference and and it it would grow year
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
after year as the um group three members
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.429 --> 04:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
um that is it financially um there's a
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
couple other uh issues that would come
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
up due to the fact that the group one
 
04:29:40.469 --> 04:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
state employees would become a closed
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
group uh no longer
 
04:29:46.990 --> 04:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
expanding and so that would have two
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
results that at some point you would
 
04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
have to alter your
 
04:29:55.149 --> 04:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
investment strategy with respect to at
 
04:29:58.830 --> 04:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
least these folks uh which would require
 
04:30:01.389 --> 04:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
isolating group one state employees from
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
other group one employees and currently
 
04:30:06.349 --> 04:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
actu it's all group ones are all group
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
ones and
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
that um as you get a group that's older
 
04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
and older and closer to retirement and
 
04:30:17.229 --> 04:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
they're not being replaced by younger
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
new hires you have a more urgent
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
liquidity needs to pay those benefits
 
04:30:26.910 --> 04:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
which means you have to start investing
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
in things that have shorter
 
04:30:34.990 --> 04:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
Horizons and um perhaps lesser returns
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
because they're more secure because
 
04:30:39.070 --> 04:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
you've got to meet short-term known
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
obligations to pay pensions for this
 
04:30:41.239 --> 04:30:42.710 align:start position:0%
obligations to pay pensions for this
group

04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
um also at some point you would change
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
your contribution calculations from a
 
04:30:53.309 --> 04:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
level dollar from a level percentage to
 
04:30:57.389 --> 04:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
a level dollar um method and that can be
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
more expensive um a
 
04:31:04.670 --> 04:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
level um dollar method is like a
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage you borrow
 
04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
$360,000 for 30 years you pay the bank
 
04:31:14.429 --> 04:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
back ,000 a year a month or plus
 
04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
interest and so you got a fixed payment
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's level
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
dollar level
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
percentage is a level percentage of
 
04:31:27.630 --> 04:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
compensation taken into account
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
Actuarial uh predictions as to payroll
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
growth and inflation and the like level
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
percentage um is used by
 
04:31:41.070 --> 04:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
70% of of plans level dollar is used by
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
about 30 % of plans um it was decided
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
when we uh put our plan into place to uh
 
04:31:50.910 --> 04:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
address the
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
underfunding uh to use a level
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
percentage because it has a lesser cost
 
04:32:01.229 --> 04:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
that spread over time whereas a level
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
dollar would have had a much
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
higher um percentage but as you've got a
 
04:32:09.870 --> 04:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
fixed group of
 
04:32:12.429 --> 04:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
people and you don't have new employees
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
coming in that you can predict payroll
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
there is no payroll growth other than
 
04:32:21.309 --> 04:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
increases in individual members salary
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have payroll growth from new
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
hires expansions of the
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
workforce um and and therefore you don't
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
have the ability or it's less accurate
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
to use a level percentage as the measure
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
so these are two things our actuar has
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
point out is a
 
04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
possibility um but they couldn't put an
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
exact dollar and cents on it but we
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
should be aware that those are some of
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
the long-term risks of having a closed
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
group that eventually everyone's going
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
to retire from and and when the last
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
person retires you're getting normal
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
contributions for that person so you
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
better have everything you need to pay
 
04:33:00.790 --> 04:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
for everyone who's retired for the rest
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
of their lives um one other point I
 
04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to make in the actuary uh points
 
04:33:08.189 --> 04:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
out in his report which we'll be
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
providing to LBA tomorrow is um the fact
 
04:33:12.840 --> 04:33:14.510 align:start position:0%
providing to LBA tomorrow is um the fact
that

04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
we evaluate uh
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
un the unfunded acred liability
 
04:33:22.320 --> 04:33:24.830 align:start position:0%
un the unfunded acred liability
by

04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:33:27.869 --> 04:33:27.879 align:start position:0%
group uh or by member
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
class employees teachers police fire we
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
have two groups teacher
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
and uh employees are in group one police
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
and fire are in group
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
two groups that are deline ated by job
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
type group three would be a delineation
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
by a higher date a completely different
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
Paradigm to call someone group three we
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
have always measured the liability for
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
group ones between the state and the
 
04:33:57.039 --> 04:33:58.349 align:start position:0%
group ones between the state and the
political

04:33:58.349 --> 04:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
political
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh
 
04:34:02.910 --> 04:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
employees as one
 
04:34:06.910 --> 04:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
group now if you go forward um it is
 
04:34:08.670 --> 04:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
possible and you're still measuring
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
things as one group as a and there's
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
been no dictat in this statute or others
 
04:34:17.070 --> 04:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
for us to change that method
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
um it could result in the state actually
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the costs of political
 
04:34:26.910 --> 04:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions but through that
 
04:34:26.920 --> 04:34:28.551 align:start position:0%
subdivisions but through that
UA

04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
UA
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
component um that's an actual concept
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
that's just a little bit above my
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
comprehension I've been a pension lawyer
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
for 32 years and I have a fair knowledge
 
04:34:43.189 --> 04:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
of actual M matters this is a
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
particularly subtle thing that the but
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
it would require according to our
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
actuary that uh in order to accurately
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
reflect what those uh that what that UA
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
should be for state
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
employees um who remain in the system
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
or go to the new plan based on their
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
higher date
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
whether that should be separate
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
separated out and calculated
 
04:35:19.830 --> 04:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
differently than for regular group one
 
04:35:22.590 --> 04:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
employees of political
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um so it it's unclear the
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
language is ambiguous and it doesn't use
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
the word UA but we assume that's what
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
they meant it uses some other
 
04:35:34.109 --> 04:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
terminology that doesn't exist but we
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
assume what they mean is the
 
04:35:39.390 --> 04:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
UA and I think that's a fair assumption
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
um but a question
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
you you have an unfunded amount and you
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
calculate what the contribution
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
percentage would be by taking that
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded amount and dividing it by the
 
04:35:54.869 --> 04:35:54.879 align:start position:0%
compensation of the members involved
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
well this statute is ambiguous about
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
whether it means the members that remain
 
04:36:02.590 --> 04:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
with nhrs or do we somehow count the
 
04:36:04.590 --> 04:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
compensation of the members who have now
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
moved over to the DC plan obviously the
 
04:36:11.709 --> 04:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
first would create a higher contribution
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
percentage because you're you're taking
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
that unfunded liability and spreading it
 
04:36:21.070 --> 04:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
over a smaller group a static group um
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
but the mechanics of bringing in the
 
04:36:25.150 --> 04:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
contribution and the compensation
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
amounts from the the the uh group three
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
or the DC plan
 
04:36:36.429 --> 04:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
members um make make that doubly
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
complicated I think it needs to be
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
clarified what is intended to mean by
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
what the state would be paying on behalf
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
of um DC plan members towards the UA in
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
any particular uh details that that
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
would require to make it clear what our
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
charge was um so that's basically the
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
financial side of it I would be glad to
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you repr Pearson thank
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair you have covered a
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
plethora of reasons why this this
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
is a dumpster fire um uh not my words
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
those are my words I was just facts not
 
04:37:22.029 --> 04:37:22.039 align:start position:0%
a point of view or we're going to get to
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
some facts because I got to be careful
 
04:37:25.830 --> 04:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
because the one time I expressed an
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
opinion in this place I got raked over
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
the calls I was here when you diding an
 
04:37:31.629 --> 04:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
opinion yep I was here when you did that
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
so you
 
04:37:39.269 --> 04:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned when the dollar amount runs
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
out right because you said
 
04:37:42.080 --> 04:37:43.590 align:start position:0%
out right because you said
said

04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
um that at some point right you're not
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
having contributory funds come
 
04:37:54.029 --> 04:37:54.039 align:start position:0%
into group one right because everybody's
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
not paying in and you said when the
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
dollar amount runs out they're going to
 
04:38:00.510 --> 04:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
need to have you better hope they have
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
enough money to pay the pensions if they
 
04:38:05.709 --> 04:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
don't who's going to have to make up for
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
that missing money well the the the plan
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
assets are all one pool of assets
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
available to pay benefits for all
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
members and groups we separate the
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
groups for purposes of assessing
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
contributions and portions of the
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
UA to try to allocate those costs but in
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
the end all 12 billion dollars we have
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
is available to all members so if you
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
come up short you come to a particular
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
payroll we don't say here's how much
 
04:38:37.629 --> 04:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
dollars we have available to pay for
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
group one members but actuar we're
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
looking at that group been
 
04:38:45.670 --> 04:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
saying it's getting smaller and smaller
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
and eventually everyone's going to be
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
retired and so we should
 
04:38:53.150 --> 04:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
actuar account for that
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
eventuality by adjusting rates now to
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
make sure we have money until the and to
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
the extent we those calculations you
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
know they're not infallible uh events in
 
04:39:04.799 --> 04:39:05.949 align:start position:0%
know they're not infallible uh events in
the

04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
world downturns in economies uh unfunded
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
legislation changes in
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions uh can all affect
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
what the underfunding is but that would
 
04:39:22.349 --> 04:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
all be reflected in the contribution
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
rates and we would we wouldn't run out
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
of money and the there would be money to
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
pay but on paper you would say that's
 
04:39:34.349 --> 04:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
not enough so we got to start charging
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
more to make up for that um so that's
 
04:39:42.510 --> 04:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
what I meant to say okay to the math on
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
that follow up um is I'm trying to
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
remember currently right now it is it
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
not something like
 
04:39:53.708 --> 04:39:53.718 align:start position:0%
85% of the money coming in from payroll
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.430 --> 04:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
dispersement uh maybe I said that
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
backwards the dispersements cover 85% of
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the dispersement that's currently
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
happening is that not coming out of
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
direct payroll and then the other 15%
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
comes from um Investments and
 
04:40:13.470 --> 04:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
I think yeah approximately current
 
04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
contributions cover approximately around
 
04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
80 85% of current
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
benefits so we you know the
 
04:40:23.070 --> 04:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
contributions paid in a particular year
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
don't cover all the benefits paid in
 
04:40:26.430 --> 04:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
that year and it's always been that way
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's why you have investment earnings
 
04:40:29.948 --> 04:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
sure that you count on I can't
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
underestimate the importance of
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
investment earnings in this equation it
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's never if if if annual contributions
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
equal annual
 
04:40:42.628 --> 04:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
distributions you wouldn't need to
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
invest anything sure you know but in a
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
perfect world that's not the way it
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
works so follow up to that then if the
 
04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
amount of contributions continues to
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
decrease as people are being removed out
 
04:40:56.190 --> 04:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
of that into this into group three is
 
04:40:59.390 --> 04:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
that going to then Force the either the
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
Investments are going to have to perform
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
better or you're going to have to find a
 
04:41:07.868 --> 04:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
way to have the paycheck contribution
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
percentage change or get larger to cover
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically the the the contribution
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
rates would have to accommodate the fact
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
that this fixed pool of group one state
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
employees is not
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
growing and uh that that and such that
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
you you can't predict uh or rather you
 
04:41:35.948 --> 04:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
can predict that your future
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
contributions with respect to that
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
cohort are going to be less and to the
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
extent you're you you you're determining
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
how to pay current benefits through
 
04:41:49.350 --> 04:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
current contribution revenues or through
 
04:41:51.510 --> 04:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
Investments then the actuar is making
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments to say that's an imbalance
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
we need to charge more or the UA would
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
increase and we need to charge more for
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
employer contributions in order to make
 
04:42:06.030 --> 04:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
up that
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
difference but that's I mean these
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
things are all inherent in a plan that
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
frees is all or a portion of its
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
membership to Future participation that
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
the plan is now going to age out
 
04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
prematurely than it would over normal
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
cost and lifespan of of a pension plan
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
because you have put a a drop dead date
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
that says no new members after that time
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that that um that throws a monkey
 
04:42:37.470 --> 04:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
wrench in the actuary's
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
normal calculations that there will be
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
payroll growth through inflation payroll
 
04:42:46.750 --> 04:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
growth through expanded
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
employment and um you know in some cases
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
for instance with teachers we reduced
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
our payroll growth because there were
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
fewer teachers so we had an actual
 
04:42:56.910 --> 04:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
assumption in the last valuation think
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
we reduced it from 2.5 to 2.1 because
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
the reality of the world is there aren't
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to be as many teachers and once
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
you re reduce that as one of your actu
 
04:43:09.868 --> 04:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
factors in in in assumptions that's
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to have a down the road effect on
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
on calculating how much money you're
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to be able to collect to to uh
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
towards the U portion of the employer
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
contribution and and adjustments are
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
made in that amount
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
accordingly thank you representative
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
chair is isn't group three the new group
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
still going to be paying in to the what
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
do you call it UA the the employers will
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
be now I will say in my technical
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
section and if we're having a
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that' be the time to talk
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
about that doesn't say how that's
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen but
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
presumably the employers will have a way
 
04:43:52.948 --> 04:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
of tracking this is how much
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
compensation that we paid our 5% on and
 
04:44:01.788 --> 04:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
here's your UA portion on that same
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
compensation another technical issue is
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
what is compensation our plan is
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
different than that plan but those are
 
04:44:10.510 --> 04:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
technical issues I think can be worked
 
04:44:10.520 --> 04:44:12.350 align:start position:0%
technical issues I think can be worked
out

04:44:12.350 --> 04:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
it can be worked out yes yes other
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative long uh
 
04:44:22.750 --> 04:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
currently what is the annualized return
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
on uh the Retirement Systems Investments
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
over say the last 10 years and do you
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
have a sense of what it would have to be
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
in order to uh remain liquid uh if you
 
04:44:38.830 --> 04:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
were not getting more new well our
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
actuaries do their basic C calculation
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
based on an assumed rate of return of
 
04:44:49.230 --> 04:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
6.75% and so when they're calculating
 
04:44:52.270 --> 04:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
whenever they're calculating a
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
liability the present value of liability
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
for future pensions or the present value
 
04:45:00.270 --> 04:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
of future contributions or expected
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
earnings they're using 6.5 as the 75 as
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
the discount rate and the actual 10%
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
return was in the presentation yeah and
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
the presentation last time we we gave uh
 
04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
351 uh in 20 years and uh I believe all
 
04:45:19.230 --> 04:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
of those were over the
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
6.75 the 20 year is the best because it
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
encompasses some years more than 20
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
years ago and the markets when were more
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
robust but we have uh consistently
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
exceeded our past fiscal year was 8
 
04:45:32.600 --> 04:45:33.550 align:start position:0%
exceeded our past fiscal year was 8
point

04:45:33.550 --> 04:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:45:37.110 --> 04:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
something um and so our investment
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
performance is has been above the
 
04:45:42.190 --> 04:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and been very favorable in comp
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
in comparison to our peer
 
04:45:52.590 --> 04:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
plans thank you representative cyc oh
 
04:45:53.708 --> 04:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me represent long you have
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
another followup uh yeah so the second
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
half of my question was do you have any
 
04:46:03.150 --> 04:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
projections on what the returns would be
 
04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
if you were having to if I could I
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be working here I'd be playing
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.628 --> 04:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
I mean no who can predict right who
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
would have predicted Nvidia would
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
increase in value tenfold over two years
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
and who would predict it would then
 
04:46:24.670 --> 04:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
crash by 40% in a
 
04:46:27.510 --> 04:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
day you know the world is wall Street's
 
04:46:29.310 --> 04:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
full of people who pretend they can
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
predict but uh I'm not one of
 
04:46:35.230 --> 04:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
those repr
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
scitech Mr Kavanaugh you've painted a
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
pretty Grim picture of what happens with
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
this closed group isn't this all due to
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
UA that in fact it doesn't matter
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
whether the group is open closed up or
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
down if there's enough assets to cover
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
when the last person retires there's
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
that last bit of investment that will
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
cover him right to the end is that are
 
04:47:06.990 --> 04:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
we not paying that price of the UA and
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
being unable to fund the Clos group from
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
all the well I would say for the most
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
part that's accurate statement in a
 
04:47:21.670 --> 04:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
sense that if there was no U there would
 
04:47:25.030 --> 04:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
be less um economic concerns about
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
having a closed group you'd still have
 
04:47:29.708 --> 04:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
the issue of investment Horizons and
 
04:47:32.110 --> 04:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
liquidity that now you've got to invest
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
in safe liquid Investments and maybe
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're R to return is only going to be
 
04:47:41.548 --> 04:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
3% uh instead of six or 6.75
 
04:47:45.150 --> 04:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and so there are both set of
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
factors but yeah if we had no
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
UA we we'd all be very happy but it's
 
04:47:54.750 --> 04:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
something all of us on both sides of
 
04:47:58.990 --> 04:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
this table inherited uh 20 years ago
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
almost and or 20 plus years ago and
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
we're doing our best to to work our way
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
through it over the long-term plan well
 
04:48:09.990 --> 04:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
I just can't help this are the the
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
member are the employees of the New
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Retirement System in the
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
retirement system oh
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
wonder I I I just wanted to point out
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
one thing that representative McGuire
 
04:48:26.350 --> 04:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
said about late in life employers
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
employees not working the 10 years we do
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
have vesting by age if you reach age 65
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
you can retire if you got three years of
 
04:48:35.868 --> 04:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
service so I mean you can get a pension
 
04:48:37.548 --> 04:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
you're not leaving the state's portion
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
on the table you can take your money and
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
leave it but you could apply for a
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
pension albe it a small one but there is
 
04:48:48.430 --> 04:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
age vesting not everyone has to have 10
 
04:48:51.070 --> 04:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
years thank you other questions I have a
 
04:48:53.470 --> 04:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
question about uh some Language online
 
04:48:54.750 --> 04:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
in page
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
one so at the bottom on 27 28 and 29 it
 
04:49:01.390 --> 04:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
talks about determining
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
positions that transition over I'm sub
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
um paraphrasing
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
but so a person that works at
 
04:49:14.548 --> 04:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
a job leaves and they hire a new person
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
right so now they're subject to this
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
group three they were subject to group
 
04:49:20.670 --> 04:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
one and it's saying that the UA for that
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
position will
 
04:49:24.150 --> 04:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
continue right right you're going to pay
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
that I filed a bill two years ago to
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
prevent political
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
subdivisions from declassifying if I
 
04:49:35.868 --> 04:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's probably the best word for it
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
declassifying positions to get out of
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
paying the
 
04:49:42.910 --> 04:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
UA I think Marty handled it but one of
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
the things that came out of that was how
 
04:49:48.990 --> 04:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult it would be to
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
determine which positions had a UA how
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
would you assign a number and then how
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
far back in the position existence do
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
you go those were things that were
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
expressed has any of that changed or
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
gotten better in two years um not
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
particularly I mean there's the the
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is an aggregate
 
04:50:10.000 --> 04:50:11.470 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is an aggregate
number

04:50:11.470 --> 04:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
um and so it's difficult you know with
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
respect to a particular group or
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
position the only time where that
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
particular we've done it once uh when a
 
04:50:24.310 --> 04:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
charter school wanted to
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
withdraw and in order to withdraw from
 
04:50:29.070 --> 04:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
the system and no longer participate
 
04:50:30.430 --> 04:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
they had to pay their share of the
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded and it was calculated based on
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
employees it had who were vested or
 
04:50:37.628 --> 04:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
already receiving
 
04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
benefits and and it was a substantial
 
04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
they had three people and they had to
 
04:50:44.990 --> 04:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
pay a substantial amount of money to get
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
out of the plan everyone else who's
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
asked since is just blocked at the
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
number so in in that circumstance where
 
04:50:54.190 --> 04:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
you have fixed people you know where
 
04:50:57.270 --> 04:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
they are what benefits they're invested
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
in what benefits they're C they're
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
collecting it is possible to say all
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
right our overall underfunding is uh 20%
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
we owe them
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
$1,000 So 20% $200 is your underfunded
 
04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
allocated and you got to pay us those
 
04:51:19.708 --> 04:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
$200 you want to get out of the system
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
but on an AG to say oh let me just look
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
at all uh
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
janitors well it's just you know the
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
demographics are all over from janitors
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
who just got hired to janitors who have
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
40 years of service you're not you're
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
not going to be able at a group level
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
ascribe that we we do do it by by uh um
 
04:51:44.430 --> 04:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
member type you know employee teachers
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know those those are big picture
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
things and it is possible for the large
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
groups to say all right the UA here is a
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
little different than here because of
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
the overall average demographics of the
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
different groups and the benefit
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
structures and the like but if an
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
employer came and said I want to
 
04:52:02.548 --> 04:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
eliminate positions a b c and d how much
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
am I going to save we'd say that's not
 
04:52:05.788 --> 04:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
the way it works you'd have to change
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
the law first and I don't even know if
 
04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.708 --> 04:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions seeing none
 
04:52:17.868 --> 04:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much and I I
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
trust we'll be be able to have your help
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:52:53.150 --> 04:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%

me to provide comments and concerns
 
04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
relating to HB 581 establishing a state

divide and conquer approach this year
 
04:54:08.190 --> 04:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
just like in
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%

Hampshire retention and recruitment our
 
04:54:28.190 --> 04:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
state employee seems to be the buzzwords
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
in almost every conversation we are
 
04:54:32.670 --> 04:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
hearing in the legislature over the past
 
04:54:35.708 --> 04:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
few years supporters of this proposed
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
change have stated portability as a
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
quote unquote strength of a defined
 
04:54:42.990 --> 04:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
contribution plan by saying quote
 
04:54:45.788 --> 04:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
portable immediate vesting savings
 
04:54:47.948 --> 04:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
maintain when changing
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
employers how is that doing anything to
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
promote retaining our employees it's
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to leave the state will
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
spend money on training these employees
 
04:55:01.390 --> 04:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
only to have them leave not only what
 
04:55:03.310 --> 04:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
they put into the Divine contribution
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
plan but what we the taxpayers put into
 
04:55:08.670 --> 04:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
the plan as well currently and if
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
employee leaves the New Hampshire retire
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
system prior to being vested they can
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
only take the funds they contributed
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
with them they do not have the ability
 
04:55:19.310 --> 04:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
to take taxpayers money that was
 
04:55:22.830 --> 04:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
invested this legislation is bad for
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers you may hear that a defined
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
contribution plan is what younger
 
04:55:29.910 --> 04:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce desires because of its
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
portability well there's been a real
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
life recent unsolicited example that
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
proves the opposite during the years of
 
04:55:41.470 --> 04:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
TW 2020 21 and 22 the community college
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire new hires were
 
04:55:44.910 --> 04:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
given a choice between the two
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
retirement plans and they overwhelmingly
 
04:55:49.470 --> 04:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
chose to join the New Hampshire
 
04:55:53.788 --> 04:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
retirement system 73% of the 82 newly

hired full-time staff between 200 20 and
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
22 chose the New Hampshire retirement
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
system over ccsnh H's 403b plan when
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
given the choice 60 chose the retirement

system 22 chose the 403b
 
04:56:14.548 --> 04:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
Define contribution 403b plans may be
 
04:56:17.430 --> 04:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for private sector employees
 
04:56:20.590 --> 04:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
however HB 581 would force hardworking
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state employees to take on
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
new long-term risks the newly hired
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
state employees under this bill would be
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
solely deal with the inflation risks
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
investment risks and the risk of
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
outliving the funds in a defin
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
contribution 403b plan there is a
 
04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous responsibility involved in
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
managing one's own retirement plan not
 
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
everyone has the knowledge or exper
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
expertise of navigating various
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
investment strategies which would put
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
many if not most at a
 
04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantage HB 581 would most certainly
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
create cost shifting back on the state
 
04:57:01.708 --> 04:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
should retirees outlift the funds of

04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
going to read them all but you can see
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
the 10 worst days in the history of the

for the State of New Hampshire they will

be compensated Less in the private

currently offered by the state and a

out conclusions on this issue and

continue to reject the idea of a defined

slotty thank you madam chair um you
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh the Dow Jones is
 
04:59:21.040 --> 04:59:21.990 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh the Dow Jones is
somewhat

04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
04:59:24.150 --> 04:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
volatile uh and is is somewhat of a
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
danger for investment uh it made me
 
04:59:29.470 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
curious as to where the defined benefit
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
plan funds are invested in the current
 
04:59:31.958 --> 04:59:35.070 align:start position:0%
plan funds are invested in the current
retirement

04:59:35.070 --> 04:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
system I don't know the answer to that
 
04:59:37.200 --> 04:59:44.670 align:start position:0%
system I don't know the answer to that
question

04:59:44.670 --> 04:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
it it is in fact in the handout on the
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.230 --> 04:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
questions I have one if unless
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative scitec does okay um
 
05:00:03.788 --> 05:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
have reports out of Alaska have
 
05:00:06.190 --> 05:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
indicated that when they attempted to do
 
05:00:09.310 --> 05:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
this they completely and totally lost
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
the ability to hire anybody have you had
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
any contact with a counterpart of yours
 
05:00:17.310 --> 05:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
in Alaska to see if that's improved or
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
changed or are they still having the
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
same inability to hire B during this
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
type of plan I haven't had any direct
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
contact just what I've read and and they
 
05:00:28.548 --> 05:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
are having difficulty and in fact
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're trying to reverse what they what
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
they did out there because it's costing
 
05:00:37.230 --> 05:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
you other questions thank thank you very

and I am a retired state
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
employee I just wanted to point out a
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
few things
 
05:01:43.470 --> 05:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
um regarding this bill I'm in opposition
 
05:01:43.480 --> 05:01:44.310 align:start position:0%
um regarding this bill I'm in opposition
to

05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
it um for more than 50 years the New
 
05:01:49.470 --> 05:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State retirement system has
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
been playing an important role in the
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
state's public employees which include
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
teachers police officers and Fir
 
05:02:00.430 --> 05:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
fighters in a Divine benefit plan the
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
current employees contribute 7% of their
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
gross pay and the state of New Hampshire
 
05:02:05.520 --> 05:02:07.430 align:start position:0%
gross pay and the state of New Hampshire
contributes

05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
contributes
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
13.5 based on their year of salary and
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
service and 10 years is required for
 
05:02:17.708 --> 05:02:17.718 align:start position:0%
vesting um except age is a
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
factor the amounts according to the last
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
48569 active members and 4
 
05:02:33.310 --> 05:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
5,330 retiree beneficiary or
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries that is a lot of people to
 
05:02:38.910 --> 05:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
be impacting with a new plan uh the
 
05:02:38.920 --> 05:02:40.510 align:start position:0%
be impacting with a new plan uh the
following

05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
following
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
um the following is the concerns of the
 
05:02:45.470 --> 05:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill I misunderstood the way the bill
 
05:02:48.270 --> 05:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
was written that it would only be
 
05:02:51.150 --> 05:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
affecting um state employees and it
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
would not be affecting firefighters
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
police and teachers into a very
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
different plan called the defined
 
05:03:00.990 --> 05:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
contribution plan the plan is very
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
different than the defined benefit plan
 
05:03:07.230 --> 05:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
in that and it the bill provides for the
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
fact that there's going to be a defined
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
contribution commission which doesn't
 
05:03:14.548 --> 05:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
sound like that's going to be a part nor
 
05:03:16.590 --> 05:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
can it be a part of the New Hampshire
 
05:03:20.750 --> 05:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system so it is very
 
05:03:24.510 --> 05:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
separate um they're going to you know
 
05:03:27.948 --> 05:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
have the employees contribute 7% but the
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
employer will only be contributing
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
five um that's a big change and
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
until um representative Maguire
 
05:03:41.708 --> 05:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned it I also and I'm not sure but
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
it clearly says that insurance won't be
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
covered I mean it'll be at their own
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
expense is what it says there now I
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't know with the amendment if that
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
corrects it or fixes it but um group
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
three Health in Insurance the way it's
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
stated here uh would be able to
 
05:04:04.548 --> 05:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
participate only at his or her expense
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
we pay something but we don't pay the
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
whole cost of the um Insurance to today
 
05:04:13.350 --> 05:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
I looked the rates up if I was to add a
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
dependent uh you would be paying
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
$1,444 cents a month for that dependent
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
if you had more than one you would be
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
paying it for two or three or whatever
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
but if you had only one dependent you
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to the retire health
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
insurance that's the kind of plan we
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
have so that could be the cost they
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
would have to participate in um that's
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
pretty significant clearly nobody could
 
05:04:39.280 --> 05:04:40.590 align:start position:0%
pretty significant clearly nobody could
cover

05:04:40.590 --> 05:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
cover
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
that um the acred liability contribution
 
05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
percentage chargeable to a group three
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
employer shall be determined by charging
 
05:04:53.548 --> 05:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
group one member ACR liability
 
05:04:56.190 --> 05:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
contribution for group three members I
 
05:04:59.670 --> 05:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
am not sure what that means but I'm not
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
sure how that but that's a concern
 
05:05:03.548 --> 05:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
because I don't understand what that
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
language is trying to say
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
um the defined contribution Commission
 
05:05:12.430 --> 05:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed to co-mingle or pull
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
assets with assets of other people or
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
entities um I don't know what that means
 
05:05:21.670 --> 05:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
again and I don't think they can be
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
pulled with any nhrs
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
Investments um so um that sounds scary I
 
05:05:30.670 --> 05:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
mean I know it was referred to as a
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
savings plan but it's going to operate
 
05:05:37.750 --> 05:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
like a regular defined compens um we
 
05:05:39.390 --> 05:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
have a deferred comp plan that we can
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
join join as well and it's an investment
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
so in Investments they try to monitor it
 
05:05:48.070 --> 05:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
so you don't have a lot of losses but
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
you have winning and losing you're not
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to be just putting it into a money
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
market you know and so this isn't just a
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
savings plan they can walk away with
 
05:05:58.270 --> 05:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to have whatever their
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
results are of their 7% plus five not 13
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
and a
 
05:06:04.920 --> 05:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
and a
half

05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
half
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I recently retired as I've
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
said before with um after 36 years and
 
05:06:18.190 --> 05:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's all relative putting 7% in I had
 
05:06:18.200 --> 05:06:19.270 align:start position:0%
it's all relative putting 7% in I had
over

05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:06:23.190 --> 05:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
$34,000 in my account and the state was
 
05:06:23.200 --> 05:06:24.910 align:start position:0%
$34,000 in my account and the state was
contributing

05:06:24.910 --> 05:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
13.5 so you can kind of do the math and
 
05:06:30.270 --> 05:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
figure out how much is sort of
 
05:06:32.430 --> 05:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
attributable you know it's not directly
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
attributable but just so you know how
 
05:06:38.150 --> 05:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
much has been collected over the years
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
um from the employer and the employee
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
percentage because of all those unknowns
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
I do not think you know anybody is doing
 
05:06:52.548 --> 05:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
a good F fiduciary
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility by separating this group
 
05:06:57.310 --> 05:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
with all of these
 
05:07:01.150 --> 05:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
unknowns and the portability on this you
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
know it's something you can leave the
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
state leave your money in the retirement
 
05:07:10.830 --> 05:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
system and then it adds to your years
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to all the people
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
that do that I did that I worked for the
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
state for seven years left for seven
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
came back left my money in the
 
05:07:20.320 --> 05:07:21.830 align:start position:0%
came back left my money in the
retirement

05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
system worked three more years and
 
05:07:24.240 --> 05:07:25.190 align:start position:0%
system worked three more years and
became

05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
became
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
vested um you don't want to take your
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
money out of the retirement system if
 
05:07:35.190 --> 05:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
you have some years in it and
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a big difference
 
05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
between a defined benefit plan and we
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
have a system that's working
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
well and it's going to continue to work
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
well and it's a great benefit for our
 
05:07:52.270 --> 05:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
state employees and the you know
 
05:07:54.548 --> 05:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
everybody says out in the Working World
 
05:07:57.628 --> 05:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
I wish I had a pension I wish I did you
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
know and this is being done for
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
employees today and been doing it for 50
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
years so it's been
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
working um making this a close end fund
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
and making all liabilities it just
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like big I don't know but um I
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
definitely hope you join me in in
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you yeah are there any
 
05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
questions no doesn't look like any thank
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%

of the committee thank you for the
 
05:08:41.948 --> 05:08:41.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak here today for the
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
record my name is Greg Moore I am
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
Regional director with Americans for

support of House Bill
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
581 um give a little personal anecdotes
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
I know that the sponsor mentioned that
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh only 27% of people actually vest in
 
05:08:59.788 --> 05:08:59.798 align:start position:0%
the program that's actually that's
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually uh a high number because there
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
are people like me who uh given a choice
 
05:09:06.990 --> 05:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
did not choose to join the Hampshire
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
retirement system when I became a state
 
05:09:11.070 --> 05:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
employee in 200 three so that that
 
05:09:12.910 --> 05:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't count for the does not account
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
for the people who simply choose not to
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
participate in New Hampshire retirement
 
05:09:18.788 --> 05:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
system so that numb actually high I
 
05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
would tell you that that looking at uh
 
05:09:24.190 --> 05:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the legislation uh it would
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
create a benefit that is meeting the
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
needs of our people younger people
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
joining the
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
workforce uh there was a time when this
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
program came into life where people were
 
05:09:37.868 --> 05:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
looking for a job where they started and
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
they continued through their career and
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
then they and they left and that met the
 
05:09:43.150 --> 05:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
needs of the workers back when this when
 
05:09:45.150 --> 05:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
the retirement system was was begun
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's no longer the case there was a
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
much bhood study about a dozen years ago
 
05:09:51.788 --> 05:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
about how Millennials change jobs every
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
18 months well a CNBC study said that
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
geners are changing jobs once every 15
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
months so that pace is actually
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
accelerating workers want jobs where
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
they can they can come they can work and
 
05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can leave and they can take what
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
they've made and bring it with them I
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
also have one one point that I would
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
mention about the legislation that it
 
05:10:13.548 --> 05:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
does not include and then and again
 
05:10:14.910 --> 05:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
you'd have to look at the Actuarial
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
tables etc etc but what it doesn't
 
05:10:21.548 --> 05:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
include is the opportunity for um
 
05:10:23.788 --> 05:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
unvested workers to switch to this new
 
05:10:26.110 --> 05:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
system and I will tell you I will tell
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
you with somebody and this was to
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
representative Long's point I had a
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
cooworker when I was at Health and Human
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
Services who literally had a countdown
 
05:10:36.190 --> 05:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
clock as a screen saver it took me a
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
while to figure out what it was I had to
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
ask him and he told me and it started
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
out about 3 years when I left the
 
05:10:42.990 --> 05:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
department it was down to a year he was
 
05:10:44.830 --> 05:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
counting down the time until he hit his
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
10-year Mark and he could and he could
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
leave the state so because 10e unbroken
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
State service is an extent is a long
 
05:10:54.030 --> 05:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
period of time for most pension systems
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
even to Define benefit ones and so I
 
05:10:59.230 --> 05:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
would I would say to you that consider
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
the Pro Prospect of people who might
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
want to move from a the current defined
 
05:11:04.990 --> 05:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
benefit system who are not yet vested
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
and to take take this opportunity to
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
switch into this system I don't think
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
any employ EMP should be trapped in a
 
05:11:11.350 --> 05:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
job that they don't
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
like great it might mean retention but
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that the employee that the
 
05:11:17.788 --> 05:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
employee that was in question good good
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
guy not the most motivated employee as
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you can imagine so I I'd ask
 
05:11:23.708 --> 05:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
you to consider that as you go through
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
your deliberations and through your
 
05:11:26.350 --> 05:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with that I'd be happy to
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%

retirement system definition defined
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%

under the administration rulemaking on

uh to the plan and the employer will
 
05:14:26.548 --> 05:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
contribute 5% when ta TI AA C came
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
before the legislature in 2011 to
 
05:14:32.350 --> 05:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
testify that a 30 to 35 year employment
 
05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
at age 65 on Social Security the total
 
05:14:38.430 --> 05:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
contribution rate should be 12% 6% for
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
05:14:44.670 --> 05:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
and 6% for the employee this this is no
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh there is no language in this bill
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
that allows for accidental disability or
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
death this is also a topic that was
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
discussed uh with Tia cff they and they
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
had to look at pursuing purchasing life
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
insurance and disability insurance
 
05:15:01.628 --> 05:15:01.638 align:start position:0%
benefits which cost would be over and
 
05:15:05.310 --> 05:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
above the 12% of contribution rate that
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
went along with the 4 414h plan that was
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
off it at that
 
05:15:13.670 --> 05:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
time by eliminating participation in the
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system this
 
05:15:17.868 --> 05:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
will impact the unfunded ACR liability
 
05:15:19.708 --> 05:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
without new contributions coming into
 
05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
the system it will be very difficult to
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
maintain the current New Hampshire
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
retirement system as we know it we have
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
talked about Recruitment and retainment
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
of employees this is no way to go about
 
05:15:33.190 --> 05:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
accomplishing that other states have
 
05:15:35.948 --> 05:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
tried similar changes and ended up going
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
back to their original plans case study
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
of the state and pension plans that
 
05:15:43.070 --> 05:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
switched to defined contribution plans
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
presented summaries of past changes in
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
three states Retirement Systems that
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
made their switch to the DC plan from a
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
traditional DB uh pension case studies
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
covering the following states West
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
Virginia Michigan and Alaska rather than
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
saving States money these DB to DC
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
switch exasperated the uh funding
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
problems and drove up pension debt
 
05:16:12.350 --> 05:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
overall certain uh Trends appeared
 
05:16:14.670 --> 05:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
common in all three states such as
 
05:16:17.788 --> 05:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
changing from a DB plan to a DC plan did
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
not help the existing
 
05:16:22.948 --> 05:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
underfunding uh problem and in fact
 
05:16:25.788 --> 05:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
increased Pension Plan cost workers
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
under the DC plan face increased level
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
of retirement insecurity the best way to
 
05:16:33.190 --> 05:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
address a pension underfunding problem
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
is to implement a responsible funding
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
policy by making the full and annual
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
requirement contribution each year and
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
to evaluate and adjust assumptions as
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
well as funding overall over time we
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
have read the entire CA if you want to
 
05:16:50.830 --> 05:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
read the entire case study published on
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
the National Institute of retirement
 
05:16:55.030 --> 05:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
security there has been a plan
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
established by the legislature to pay
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
off the unfunded acred liability in the
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system when
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
that is done the normal cost for state
 
05:17:05.548 --> 05:17:05.558 align:start position:0%
employees is going to be
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
2.42% less than the 5% that's under this
 
05:17:08.320 --> 05:17:09.430 align:start position:0%
2.42% less than the 5% that's under this
bill

05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
the system is not broken if the past
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
legislators would have left the system
 
05:17:15.628 --> 05:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
alone we would not be in the condition
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
we are today it is due to past
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
manipulation of funds changes to the
 
05:17:22.350 --> 05:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
assumptions and methodologies that help
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
create a major part of the problems we
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
are solving today let the New Hampshire
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system continue its course
 
05:17:30.590 --> 05:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's Been instrumental to thousands of
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
members for over nearly 60 years please
 
05:17:36.470 --> 05:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
vote the itl house bill 581 and I will
 
05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you are there
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions represent s did you say those
 
05:17:45.070 --> 05:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
three states switched back the three
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
states that they did a study on that
 
05:17:50.350 --> 05:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh it was yes uh West Virginia
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
Michigan and
 
05:17:53.708 --> 05:17:53.718 align:start position:0%
Alaska that that was a study or they
 
05:17:55.030 --> 05:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
actually switched
 
05:17:58.030 --> 05:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
back they went to a DC plan I believe I
 
05:18:00.910 --> 05:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
know Alaska did um the other two um I
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
believe did also but I'm not sure if
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
they left the Gap there but you can read
 
05:18:06.628 --> 05:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
the whole study it's on the national
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
inst Institute on retirement security is
 
05:18:11.230 --> 05:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
where that information is
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
available thank you other any questions
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
I have a question in reference you
 
05:18:18.670 --> 05:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
um uh death and disability in insurance
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
policies can can you can you just hit
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
that one more time yes uh when we went
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
when we went through the same exact
 
05:18:31.750 --> 05:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
thing back in 2011 that was brought up
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in the current
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that if you get injured in
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
the line of duty or if you die in the
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
line of duty there's no there's no
 
05:18:41.230 --> 05:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
benefit all you get is your defined
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
benefit plan uh defined contribution
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
plan so if you're a new employee and you
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
only have $1,000 in that plan you you
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
die that that's all you're getting you
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't have you have no insurance so they
 
05:18:57.628 --> 05:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
said that they when I say they um uh the
 
05:19:00.910 --> 05:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
group that testified back then Tia cff
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
stated they would have to purchase
 
05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
accidental disability and death benefits
 
05:19:10.030 --> 05:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
to pay off those um those members MERS
 
05:19:13.470 --> 05:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
follow up yes who would have to pay that
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
would for those policies that would be
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
part of the cost associated with
 
05:19:18.750 --> 05:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of the plan so it' be
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
open and above the 12% that they were
 
05:19:23.470 --> 05:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
saying was going to cost the to
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
implement the plan does that mean
 
05:19:27.390 --> 05:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
employer is that what you're saying it
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:34.030 --> 05:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay any other
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
you referenced this for Mo brief moment
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
in your testimony a moment ago but is it
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
not the case that uh that when the
 
05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
legislature started tinkering with the
 
05:19:57.708 --> 05:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
system back in I think about the 1990s
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
you hit it on the head
 
05:20:03.030 --> 05:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
but uh that they were told by the
 
05:20:06.270 --> 05:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
employees unions and so forth uh warned
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
not to do this uh this was going to uh
 
05:20:12.030 --> 05:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
you know cause problems in the long run
 
05:20:15.310 --> 05:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh that you were by
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
creating the special account and all
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
these other things and so forth you were
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
creating a Sit situation where
 
05:20:24.868 --> 05:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
liabilities and assets were going to
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
cross at some
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
point uh and the system was going to go
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
underwater and we were
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
misinformed I wasn't in the legislature
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
at that point but it only seemed like it
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
um but in any case they they uh they
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
they were told not to do this oh it was
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a short-term solution
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's only going to be for short term
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
because they were going to help out the
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
employers by lowering
 
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
their the call on their assets uh to
 
05:21:02.990 --> 05:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
keep it going but uh the the net effect
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
was it got forgotten that it was going
 
05:21:08.948 --> 05:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
to be shortterm it got left in effect
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
and the the then
 
05:21:16.868 --> 05:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
actuary told us we were 125% funded we
 
05:21:20.708 --> 05:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
had plenty of monies and so forth uh and
 
05:21:24.430 --> 05:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately when I came on Edna 19 years
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
ago we were confronting the reality that
 
05:21:31.390 --> 05:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
we were in the ditch and going down fast
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
and we had to
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
undo uh the that that situation and
 
05:21:40.350 --> 05:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
that's when we started dealing with the
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
UA right yeah you're absolutely correct
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative correct representative in
 
05:21:46.830 --> 05:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
1990 they changed the interest
 
05:21:48.750 --> 05:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
assumption rate up to 9 and three
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
quarters which was unprecedented at the
 
05:21:52.708 --> 05:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
time was the highest rate of interest
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
assumption in the country um and they
 
05:21:57.510 --> 05:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
changed the methodology from entry age
 
05:22:00.350 --> 05:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
normal to open aggregate Group which
 
05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
pushed the liabilities off to the Future
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
and they they never got paid off so that
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct that was the
 
05:22:08.868 --> 05:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
key to the start of the downfall of the
 
05:22:11.230 --> 05:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
system was when they started messing
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
around with the interest assumption
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
rates and the methodology and now they
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
finally turned it back to the old way
 
05:22:21.150 --> 05:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
isn't it also the case that uh that
 
05:22:23.548 --> 05:22:23.558 align:start position:0%
that's when they created the special
 
05:22:26.310 --> 05:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
account special account was created in
 
05:22:29.070 --> 05:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
1983 well it was back in that general
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
area but but given the the assurances of
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
the actuary that we were 125% funded you
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
know all all the the all the returns all
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
the earnings over I think it was 8 and
 
05:22:46.390 --> 05:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
3/4% or something like that they flowed
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
over into the special account correct
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
anything over one anything over one half
 
05:22:53.390 --> 05:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
or 1% of the assumed rate of return went
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
into the special account that's right so
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
that money was was taken out of the
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
Corpus so you never had a really good
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
year from that point on isn't that the
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
case we had good years until 2000 then
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
then when when the market crashed um it
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
was a Snowball Effect be because the
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
money was being siphoned off over and
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
above the assume rate of return When
 
05:23:16.390 --> 05:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
good years when we had a bad year there
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
was no money going into the system to
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
make up that bad year so you never had
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
is it not the case you never had thank
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair that you never had a
 
05:23:26.830 --> 05:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
really good year you only had good years
 
05:23:30.070 --> 05:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
and bad years because the the the really
 
05:23:33.310 --> 05:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
good years the those revenues went into
 
05:23:36.270 --> 05:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
the special account correct and to be
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
honest with you a representative with
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
that I was on the board when they made
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
those changes and I was one of two board
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
members that voted against all those
 
05:23:45.070 --> 05:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
changes because we felt it was going to
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
hurt the system and when they wrote down
 
05:23:49.990 --> 05:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
the assets uh and and to pay off the
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
Social Security offset for group one
 
05:23:53.670 --> 05:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
that was a $200 million piece of
 
05:23:56.070 --> 05:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that they took 20% of the
 
05:23:58.510 --> 05:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
assets because they did say we were 135%
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
funded um and then once the benefit was
 
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
paid for they never paid for new
 
05:24:06.670 --> 05:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
employees coming on that bill was
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
exponentially expensive and that's when
 
05:24:10.510 --> 05:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
the rat started going up for the
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
employers and that's when they
 
05:24:15.150 --> 05:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
complained back in 1990 cuz the that
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
bill went in in
 
05:24:18.628 --> 05:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
1988 then they started changing the
 
05:24:20.310 --> 05:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
methodology to try to catch up to what
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
the rates were going
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
05:24:26.910 --> 05:24:26.920 align:start position:0%

05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
explanation I'm sorry madam chairman the

Bob blazel I'm the senior lobbyist for
 
05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
the state employees
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
Association I
 
05:25:02.590 --> 05:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
um would like to just point out a couple
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
a couple things here um first and
 
05:25:07.628 --> 05:25:07.638 align:start position:0%
foremost um representative scitec you
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
about of Mr B relating to which states
 
05:25:15.030 --> 05:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
and whatnot if you look at the handout
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
that was given by Rich gulla earlier
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's all passed out in the back of his
 
05:25:22.030 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony you will see that
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
entire um you will see the entire study
 
05:25:31.150 --> 05:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
right here which includes um all of
 
05:25:34.910 --> 05:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
those states with a very detailed uh
 
05:25:39.310 --> 05:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
message um that that message is is
 
05:25:41.548 --> 05:25:41.558 align:start position:0%
basically um among the states that
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
switched to a DC Plan cost
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
Rose negative cash flow
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
grew and the employee turnover
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
increased um this is for Alaska Kentucky
 
05:25:59.788 --> 05:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
Michigan Oklahoma and um West
 
05:25:59.798 --> 05:26:01.590 align:start position:0%
Michigan Oklahoma and um West
Virginia

05:26:01.590 --> 05:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
Virginia
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
um it also talks about how it it leaves
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers supporting the cost of two
 
05:26:10.750 --> 05:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
plans uh for for many many
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
decades um it talks about how among the
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
states studied here uh previously
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the employer cost increased
 
05:26:22.590 --> 05:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
significantly uh after closing a pension
 
05:26:22.600 --> 05:26:24.430 align:start position:0%
significantly uh after closing a pension
plan

05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:26:27.470 --> 05:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
um in the closed plans cash flows have
 
05:26:29.548 --> 05:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
become more negative over
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
time um you know the available data
 
05:26:35.150 --> 05:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
suggests that DC plans are are are
 
05:26:37.708 --> 05:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
failing to help many workers accumulate
 
05:26:39.708 --> 05:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
um efficient retirement
 
05:26:42.750 --> 05:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
savings you know it goes on and on and
 
05:26:44.430 --> 05:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
and this isn't any new information you
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
also have the legislative history um in
 
05:26:51.070 --> 05:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
that same packet um it it's just we just
 
05:26:54.270 --> 05:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
have more more upto-date current um
 
05:26:56.350 --> 05:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
information about why this isn't good
 
05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayer it's not good for uh
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
recruiting new employees um it's not
 
05:27:04.030 --> 05:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
good for the backend for these group
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
three employees that um you heard about
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
the stock market you know how it it I
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
mean it's very very different to have to
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
have a defined benefit plan within the
 
05:27:19.628 --> 05:27:19.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system and kind of
 
05:27:21.390 --> 05:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
struck me odd
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor of this Bill said and I
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
quote earlier today defined benef the
 
05:27:32.190 --> 05:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
defined benefit works by guesswork and
 
05:27:32.200 --> 05:27:33.948 align:start position:0%
defined benefit works by guesswork and
expensive

05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:27:37.310 --> 05:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
actuaries I I that makes absolutely no
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
sense to me um this this legislature uh
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
put into place um an investment
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee over at the New Hampshire
 
05:27:49.590 --> 05:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system with highly capable
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
individuals if you look at for the last
 
05:27:52.320 --> 05:27:53.708 align:start position:0%
individuals if you look at for the last
10

05:27:53.708 --> 05:27:53.718 align:start position:0%
10
 
05:27:57.628 --> 05:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
years okay the rate of return they
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're averaging
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
7.9% now whether that's guess work or
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
not that's that's pretty good in 2024
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
was 8.8 in 2023 was
 
05:28:12.990 --> 05:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
8.2 pretty good guesswork no it's
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
actually not guesswork it's intelligent
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
people who take their roles
 
05:28:22.390 --> 05:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
very it's this is something that is um
 
05:28:25.788 --> 05:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
very important for our
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
retirees there is no guesswork I just
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
need to emphasize that it was also
 
05:28:32.590 --> 05:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
stated that the amendment here uh came
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
out of the subcommittee
 
05:28:37.470 --> 05:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
process what you need to understand is
 
05:28:40.150 --> 05:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
the full cont context the full context
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
is this what you have before you here
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
today ladies and gentlemen you have a
 
05:28:46.948 --> 05:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
05:28:46.958 --> 05:28:48.510 align:start position:0%
piece of
legislation

05:28:48.510 --> 05:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
that couldn't even get out of committee
 
05:28:53.590 --> 05:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
with a favorable
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation it was
 
05:28:58.590 --> 05:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
retained when it was retained there was
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely zero work done on it with
 
05:29:04.510 --> 05:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
public the bill you have before you
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that was
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
defeated shortly after that this issue
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
was indefinitely
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
postponed for this Define contribution
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
plan okay that is because the history of
 
05:29:26.830 --> 05:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
this issue in this state as it relates
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
to state state
 
05:29:32.270 --> 05:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
retirees it makes no
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
sense the state employees aren't asking
 
05:29:34.680 --> 05:29:35.548 align:start position:0%
sense the state employees aren't asking
for

05:29:35.548 --> 05:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:38.350 --> 05:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
it I don't see any of them here asking
 
05:29:38.360 --> 05:29:39.350 align:start position:0%
it I don't see any of them here asking
for

05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:42.430 --> 05:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
it it boggles my mind it was also
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that representative Wier has
 
05:29:47.670 --> 05:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
has sent you testimony okay I know Ken
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
Ken's a good friend of mine known him a
 
05:29:51.230 --> 05:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
long time 28
 
05:29:54.670 --> 05:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
years I know that he had a defined
 
05:29:56.548 --> 05:29:56.558 align:start position:0%
benefit plan and defined contribution
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
plan he did very very well well guess
 
05:30:04.390 --> 05:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
what right now our state employees
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
basically have the same thing they have
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
their defined benefit
 
05:30:11.948 --> 05:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
okay and they had their Deferred
 
05:30:14.350 --> 05:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
Comp okay
 
05:30:17.788 --> 05:30:17.798 align:start position:0%
403b so that's what they have right now
 
05:30:20.830 --> 05:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
that representative wer had good for
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
both of them and you'll see now not not
 
05:30:25.868 --> 05:30:25.878 align:start position:0%
not knowing what what representative wer
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
wrote but I've heard this testimony
 
05:30:30.750 --> 05:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
before and I can tell you good for him
 
05:30:32.190 --> 05:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
and good for all of us that our state
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
employees and representative Wilder have
 
05:30:33.840 --> 05:30:39.708 align:start position:0%
employees and representative Wilder have
both

05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
um Karen irn mentioned a very good point
 
05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
with this amendment um on lines three to
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
five and whether anybody really picked
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
up on it I know Karen did and she's
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct if you go to RSA 21
 
05:30:55.160 --> 05:30:56.230 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct if you go to RSA 21
colon

05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
colon
 
05:30:59.788 --> 05:30:59.798 align:start position:0%
I um 30 Roman numeral
 
05:31:02.190 --> 05:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
2 that's where you'll see where the
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
state actually um pays for um says here
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
the state shall pay a premium or partial
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
premium for each Medicare eligible
 
05:31:16.390 --> 05:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
retired employee and it goes on it's
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
really disturbing that with this new
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
plan that now um it's covered by
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
entirely by the group three
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
employee how are we supposed to recruit
 
05:31:32.948 --> 05:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
people when that's the case when right
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
now they have what they have up with
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
right now under group one they have the
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
ability for the state to help them later
 
05:31:43.750 --> 05:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
on in life with that
 
05:31:47.150 --> 05:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
premium so I don't see anything in here
 
05:31:47.160 --> 05:31:49.150 align:start position:0%
premium so I don't see anything in here
that

05:31:49.150 --> 05:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
helps recruit any
 
05:31:53.628 --> 05:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
individuals represented more I mean
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me um Mr Moore mentioned um that
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
he knew an an employee that had a
 
05:32:03.628 --> 05:32:03.638 align:start position:0%
countdown had countdown for 10 years
 
05:32:04.990 --> 05:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
when he was
 
05:32:07.150 --> 05:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
vested basically what he did was he
 
05:32:09.628 --> 05:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
proved the point that's retention right
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
there that's retention that's what we're
 
05:32:12.750 --> 05:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do we're trying to retain
 
05:32:12.760 --> 05:32:14.628 align:start position:0%
trying to do we're trying to retain
these

05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:32:17.548 --> 05:32:17.558 align:start position:0%
employees okay and of
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
course those of you who heard me say
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
this before you know who who really care
 
05:32:24.830 --> 05:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
about taxpayer
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
dollars as you know under this proposed
 
05:32:31.150 --> 05:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
plan taxpayer dollars go out the window
 
05:32:33.548 --> 05:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
years one through 10 if somebody decides
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
to leave whereas right now it's
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
protected taxpayer dollars are protected
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
right now for those people that that are
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
years other than that uh I know the the
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
day is getting long and I don't believe
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
I have anything else to say um more than
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer uh any questions
 
05:32:57.990 --> 05:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
at this
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions don't see any thank you very
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
much for your appreciate you all thank
 
05:33:18.910 --> 05:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Tony
 
05:33:23.670 --> 05:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
luckus I live in Hudson New Hampshire uh
 
05:33:25.150 --> 05:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's good to be back for the committee I
 
05:33:27.948 --> 05:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
was on this committee for four years and
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
I was a co-sponsor of a uh similar Bill
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago and I'm just going
 
05:33:37.510 --> 05:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
to try and quickly go through a number
 
05:33:39.430 --> 05:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
of points that were raised and concerns
 
05:33:41.670 --> 05:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
that were raised
 
05:33:45.948 --> 05:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
um so there was some discussion of the
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
misbehavior or the bad decisions made by
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature in the past that's
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
gotten us in a bad situation
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
now um you know this would start the
 
05:33:58.030 --> 05:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
process of insulating the state from
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
such bad behavior because once the money
 
05:33:59.958 --> 05:34:00.868 align:start position:0%
such bad behavior because once the money
goes

05:34:00.868 --> 05:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
goes
 
05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
into uh the retirement plan um the the
 
05:34:06.510 --> 05:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
legislature cannot mess with the money
 
05:34:09.270 --> 05:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's already in there um so it's a
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
little bit of starting you know lead us
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
not into temptation I'd like to think
 
05:34:14.830 --> 05:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
that the legislature would never do
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
something like that again but they did
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
it before so who knows we can't b a
 
05:34:19.440 --> 05:34:20.310 align:start position:0%
it before so who knows we can't b a
future

05:34:20.310 --> 05:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:34:23.670 --> 05:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
one um there was concern raised by a
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
couple people about um the retirement
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care um my understanding is you
 
05:34:33.470 --> 05:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
know with the bill and especially with
 
05:34:36.910 --> 05:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment group one and group three
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be treated exactly the same way
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
so if you you want to provide it and in
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
both cases they're fully paid for by um
 
05:34:49.150 --> 05:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
by the employee and if you want to add a
 
05:34:51.670 --> 05:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh dependent to the plan it would be the
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
same charge um the the uh most recent
 
05:34:58.390 --> 05:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
speaker raised no some other points that
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
um will have to be looked at there's a
 
05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
number of things I'm not going to
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
address that uh concerns raised that I'm
 
05:35:06.830 --> 05:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
hoping that uh can be addressed before
 
05:35:09.070 --> 05:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee um but because I I
 
05:35:10.708 --> 05:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
can't deal with them right
 
05:35:13.150 --> 05:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
now another thing is there's a concern
 
05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
raised um by a couple people about the
 
05:35:18.990 --> 05:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
increase in cost to the state because of
 
05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
the increase of the 2 and a half uh
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
percent to 5% of the state
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
contribution as I recall I could be
 
05:35:27.150 --> 05:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
wrong but as I recall that was done as
 
05:35:28.628 --> 05:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill and partly
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
because I think the committee just felt
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
bad about having such a low
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
um you know State contribution
 
05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
but and certainly the committee here
 
05:35:43.110 --> 05:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
could could bring it back to 2 and a
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
half% but the thing to realize is that's
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
how much we're contributing now to all
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
all of the the at least the group one
 
05:35:52.590 --> 05:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
employees group two is maybe more
 
05:35:54.750 --> 05:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
complicated um
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
so if that's that's a concern it can be
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
adjusted back
 
05:36:04.948 --> 05:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns about um you know
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
the state group one becoming a closed
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
group and that causing um you know some
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
problems um
 
05:36:17.310 --> 05:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
and you know the the retirement system
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to make predictions of what's
 
05:36:23.070 --> 05:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future and um you
 
05:36:24.910 --> 05:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
know and set the contribution rates the
 
05:36:28.750 --> 05:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
normal charge um based on that but if
 
05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
they make a mistake either today with
 
05:36:32.990 --> 05:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
the current group one or with this group
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
three then you know if they estimate if
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
the returns aren't what they expect Ed
 
05:36:40.910 --> 05:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
or some other you know some of the other
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
assumptions they make don't work out and
 
05:36:46.190 --> 05:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
result in uh less money coming in then
 
05:36:48.270 --> 05:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to incre increase the UA
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
and thus the the cont the U
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
contributions paid for by employers and
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's true whether that mistake is made
 
05:36:58.750 --> 05:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to group one today or this
 
05:36:58.760 --> 05:36:59.590 align:start position:0%
with respect to group one today or this
group

05:36:59.590 --> 05:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:37:02.590 --> 05:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
three um it's one big pull of money as
 
05:37:04.670 --> 05:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
as the nhrs people said now the way
 
05:37:05.708 --> 05:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
they're doing the accounting they're
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
pulling it out separate and and so that
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
might make the error more obvious but it
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't substantively change the
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
economic situation of the retirement
 
05:37:17.310 --> 05:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
system because that money has got to
 
05:37:19.590 --> 05:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
come from somewhere and it's ends up
 
05:37:21.628 --> 05:37:21.638 align:start position:0%
basically increasing the oal and thus
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
the payments from the
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
employers I think uh represented scitec
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think actually brought that
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
up um there were some
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know apparently alarming uh
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
numbers put out about the uh drops in
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
the stock stock market on particular
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
days particular days don't matter you
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
need to look at what happens over the
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
longer term retirement savings and
 
05:37:48.270 --> 05:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
investment is a longer term
 
05:37:52.750 --> 05:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
thing um I didn't we had the data two
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
years ago I don't have it with me
 
05:37:55.948 --> 05:37:55.958 align:start position:0%
currently we'll try and bring it to the
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but you know even with the
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
terrible stuff that happened in 1929 if
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
you take a period of years over that you
 
05:38:09.150 --> 05:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
know there's been a positive return um
 
05:38:11.948 --> 05:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
and um you know some of these uh these
 
05:38:15.708 --> 05:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
dips are seem dramatic but if you ignore
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
them things you know return to Trend
 
05:38:24.030 --> 05:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
generally so there was uh statements
 
05:38:25.868 --> 05:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
made that having the current system and
 
05:38:27.948 --> 05:38:27.958 align:start position:0%
the vesting you know the 10year vesting
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
would contribute to retention well if
 
05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the tiny percentage of
 
05:38:34.750 --> 05:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
people that stay 10 years anyway that
 
05:38:37.590 --> 05:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
apparently isn't working very well and
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
and um and there were statements that
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
well if the employees leave earlier then
 
05:38:43.030 --> 05:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
the money some of the money stays with
 
05:38:45.708 --> 05:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
the state which is true but I find it
 
05:38:47.590 --> 05:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
interesting that representatives and
 
05:38:50.310 --> 05:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
organization that are representing the
 
05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh state employees would would support
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
in effect harm to the employees which is
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
really what's going
 
05:38:56.878 --> 05:38:58.670 align:start position:0%
really what's going
on

05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:39:01.910 --> 05:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um when we had uh testimony before the
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee last time and then I had some
 
05:39:06.670 --> 05:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
extensive discussions with some people
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the Bill uh afterwards
 
05:39:11.390 --> 05:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
privately trying to you know see what
 
05:39:12.910 --> 05:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
their real concerns were and trying to
 
05:39:15.548 --> 05:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
address those particular issues at least
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
in that discussion what it came down to
 
05:39:19.390 --> 05:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
was concern that
 
05:39:21.830 --> 05:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
um employees especially lower level
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
employees the ones that were you know
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
there was the DOT truck driver or
 
05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
whatever uh would make foolish decisions
 
05:39:29.788 --> 05:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
um with the
 
05:39:32.310 --> 05:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
Investments and would end up with uh
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
with no retirement and um the way these
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
plans generally work is there's a
 
05:39:42.110 --> 05:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
default um investment which is
 
05:39:44.910 --> 05:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
um you know based on the time until you
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
retire your money is going to go into
 
05:39:49.788 --> 05:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
some mix of uh stocks for higher return
 
05:39:51.990 --> 05:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
and bonds for more safety and their
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
standard in the financial world and
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
retirement world there's standards for
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and typically at
 
05:40:00.750 --> 05:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
least my experience the default is going
 
05:40:04.030 --> 05:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
to be something like that um and as part
 
05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
of these usually you get
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
um you know you get there's some
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
education and other things and I don't
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
know they could look at putting other
 
05:40:14.230 --> 05:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions on it but I don't think
 
05:40:17.190 --> 05:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of problem that U you
 
05:40:18.990 --> 05:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
know that they're looking at that it
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
would be such a problem that they're
 
05:40:20.320 --> 05:40:21.190 align:start position:0%
would be such a problem that they're
looking

05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
looking
 
05:40:21.200 --> 05:40:23.110 align:start position:0%
looking
at

05:40:23.110 --> 05:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:40:28.030 --> 05:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
um and I will say that you know some
 
05:40:29.310 --> 05:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
people have talked about the personal
 
05:40:32.110 --> 05:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
experience I actually started out uh
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
with a uh a pension plan you know the
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
company I worked at I was there for over
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
16 years
 
05:40:41.110 --> 05:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh before I left I was vested but
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
presented with the option of um either
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
eventually getting a pension when I
 
05:40:49.230 --> 05:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
retired many years after that it was a '
 
05:40:53.830 --> 05:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
96 or um taking you know the amount that
 
05:40:55.708 --> 05:40:55.718 align:start position:0%
I invested in the plan and roll it over
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
to something like an IRA or another
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
401K looked at the numbers at that time
 
05:41:03.150 --> 05:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
and I did choose to roll it over and not
 
05:41:04.030 --> 05:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
get the
 
05:41:06.910 --> 05:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
pension um I have since looked back at
 
05:41:08.910 --> 05:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
that and it turns out that was a a very
 
05:41:11.190 --> 05:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
good decision and I ended up uh
 
05:41:13.830 --> 05:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
significantly better off as a
 
05:41:13.840 --> 05:41:16.070 align:start position:0%
significantly better off as a
result

05:41:16.070 --> 05:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
result
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
um so you know
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
that you know generally you're going to
 
05:41:23.230 --> 05:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
end up and and most people I know have
 
05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
ended up better off with a you know a
 
05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
401k or IRA than uh actually having a
 
05:41:28.400 --> 05:41:29.628 align:start position:0%
401k or IRA than uh actually having a
pension

05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
pension
 
05:41:32.910 --> 05:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
system um and there there's really one
 
05:41:34.390 --> 05:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
other one other one that I just thought
 
05:41:38.190 --> 05:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
of um here is that and this you'd have
 
05:41:39.468 --> 05:41:39.478 align:start position:0%
to talk to the state treasurer to find
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
out if this is true but not only is the
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
state currently have um significant debt
 
05:41:46.110 --> 05:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
around the time retirement system we
 
05:41:49.868 --> 05:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
heard like 5.2 billion um but as long as
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
we maintain the defined benefit plan the
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
state's at risk of that happening in the
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
future and that might you know moving
 
05:41:59.230 --> 05:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
away from that to a defined contribution
 
05:42:02.830 --> 05:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
plan might have a positive uh impact on
 
05:42:04.548 --> 05:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
the state credit rating which would
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
actually save the state money in the
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
long run
 
05:42:09.310 --> 05:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
um as I said there are other issues that
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
are raised that I I'm not you know not
 
05:42:13.948 --> 05:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
in a position to address right now see
 
05:42:16.030 --> 05:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
what could be done in the future but
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's all I have right now and if
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions I'll make an
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
attempt at answering thank you present
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank
 
05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
you you you alluded to the concerns that
 
05:42:30.468 --> 05:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
have been expressed about group one
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
becoming a closed
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
system after group three is
 
05:42:38.110 --> 05:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
created isn't this overall Social
 
05:42:40.270 --> 05:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
Security System kind of analogous to
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
that that there's been a population
 
05:42:45.948 --> 05:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
decline well it's become a Clos system
 
05:42:48.350 --> 05:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
and actually not I mean there's still
 
05:42:50.510 --> 05:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
more people being born going into the
 
05:42:53.948 --> 05:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
workforce um you know and getting into
 
05:42:55.230 --> 05:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
the social security system and the
 
05:42:57.788 --> 05:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
social security system is
 
05:43:00.150 --> 05:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
financially horribly unsound and that's
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
another whole topic though um and and
 
05:43:06.430 --> 05:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
this system was hopefully we're in a
 
05:43:08.190 --> 05:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
path to pay it off but that's always a
 
05:43:10.830 --> 05:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
political risk I know when I was here it
 
05:43:13.110 --> 05:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
was an ongoing battle to fight attempts
 
05:43:13.120 --> 05:43:14.468 align:start position:0%
was an ongoing battle to fight attempts
to

05:43:14.468 --> 05:43:14.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:43:17.948 --> 05:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
um to interfere with paying off the
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability I hope the
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislature of the future till it's paid
 
05:43:25.030 --> 05:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
off is able to withstand those forces
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
but there's no
 
05:43:31.948 --> 05:43:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
you is there any anyone else who wishes
 
05:43:40.990 --> 05:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
to testify on House Bill
 
05:43:44.070 --> 05:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
581 all right seeing none I'll close the
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing this bill
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 637 are going to the
 
05:43:54.030 --> 05:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
pension subcommittee and representative
 
05:43:57.390 --> 05:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
Lan will schedule work sessions as
 
05:44:06.030 --> 05:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
