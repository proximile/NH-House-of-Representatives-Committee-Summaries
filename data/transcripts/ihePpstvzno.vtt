00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
kidding okay then um I'm I'm ready for a
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
motion and at this point if someone
 
00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 align:start position:0%
wants to make a
 
00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
motion um I'll make a motion to uh place
 
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
it in interm study or recommend it goes
 
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
an inter term
 
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
that okay any
 
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
discussion I just think it's clear that
 
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
it needs to be um yeah needs to be
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
studied I think there's a lot of moving
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
parts and I don't think we want to do
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
anything too quickly but I think it's
 
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
into no yeah I concur as well because I
 
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
I I I think parents are still able to do
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
again I know from what what we heard
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
from uh the folks out there it's it's uh
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
dicey but there's a lot to it a lot of
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
moving Parts I guess so um to study a
 
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more I don't think would hurt
 
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
so um then we'll go ahead and take a
 
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
votee any other
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
discussion okay all in favor of the
 
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 align:start position:0%

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
study okay um I don't think there's any
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
