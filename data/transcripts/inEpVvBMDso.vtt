legislative budget assistant for the
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire as representative
 
00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 align:start position:0%
Weiler stated we worked with the house
 
00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
in the month of March in the beginning
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
of April to pass their budget uh your
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
budget and then we work with the senate
 
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
in April all the way through June and
 
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.089 align:start position:0%
in April all the way through June and
actually

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 align:start position:0%
they beat tomorrow to take a vote on
 
00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
their budget so they're still
 
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
technically working with the Senate I'm
 
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
going to go over the Senate finance
 
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation I can tell you
 
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 align:start position:0%
right now that as you know there will be
 
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 align:start position:0%
floor amendments there'll be debate
 
00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 align:start position:0%
there'll be other negotiations going on
 
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
as I'm talking so this may change but
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
this is going to get the 99 percent of
 
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
what they're going to work off of so
 
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
both the house and the senate had a
 
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
beginning balance from 23 of
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
361.4 million dollars in the general and
 
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund uh the total
 
00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
revenues uh estimated senate had three
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
177.9 so it's almost 60 million dollars
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
over what the house had and we talked
 
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
about during the house phase is the
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
Senate it has the benefit of later
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue collections in the March and
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
April Revenue collections which are your
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
two largest months for business taxes
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms Etc so they did have
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue total Appropriations
 
00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 align:start position:0%
the Senate also had lapsing there was
 
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
about 30 million that lapsed from House
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 2023 which was the energy relief
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed last fall and the
 
00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 align:start position:0%
30 million of that will last so the
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
Senate was the benefit of that lap so
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
those two amounts right there was over
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars that the senate had
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
in the general fund in education trust
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
fund that the house did not total
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to the senate about 3.3
 
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 align:start position:0%
leaving accumulative ending about 201.8
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
they're transferred to the rainy day
 
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
fund was 68.7 million dollars is the
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
current estimate it was 69.7 but then
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate did pass the bail
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
um the bail status system bill in House
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 610 of a million dollars that took
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
them down from when Finance added so
 
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
68.7 bringing the rainy day fund balance
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
to 228.6 at the end of 23. your balance
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
after transfers since it's a combined
 
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
statement this is your education trust
 
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
fund anything remaining at the end of
 
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year in the education trust
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
fund carries forward into the next
 
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
fiscal year any balance remaining of the
 
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
general fund at the end of a buying and
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
has to be transferred to the rainy day
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
fund unless suspended by the legislature
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
it wasn't so that will add 68.7 million
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
to the current 159.9 million dollar
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
balance bringing it to 228.6 we're still
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
going to watch uh there's you know we're
 
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
only in June the beginning of June it's
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to be June Revenue collections we
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
know that the Senate weighs means
 
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates if
 
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
the state hits plan in June for Revenue
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
collections they'll be at the Senate
 
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
estimates almost to the dollar so as we
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
get through the middle of the month if
 
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
the you start to see that the revenue
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
estimates are above for the month of
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
June that's additional money that's
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
going to go into the rainy day for under
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
carry forward to the education trust
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
fund depending on its source
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
so for 24 the only beginning balance is
 
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund house had about
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
183.8 Senate 133.1 and I'll show you why
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
they had that reduction when we get to
 
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 align:start position:0%
those lines total revenues house had
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
3127.9 senate had 3194 so almost 67
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
million dollars of additional revenues
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
over the house
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
total Appropriations the house had 3.165
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance 3.097 close to 3.1 Keelan
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
of ending balance at the end of 24 the
 
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
229.4 between the general education
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund the share the general fund
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
share is 42 million in the education
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund share is 187.8 million
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
and before I go on one of the big
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
reasons we'll start to see it when I
 
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
have a separate General and education
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
trust fund Revenue there's a difference
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
between the amount of business taxes
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
that the house proposed going to the
 
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
remember the house had 77.5 of all
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
business tax collections going into the
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
general fund in 22.5 staying in the
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the Senate
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
kept the splits or put the splits in
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
statute at 59.41 which is their current
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
law it's roughly the current law
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
percentages that are split between the
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund as a
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
result as we get to 25 you'll see that
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate is going to have a much
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
larger balance in the education trust
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
fund the house to uh main reason is
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
because of that business tax split
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
decision that they had
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
so beginning in 25 the beginning balance
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
of 229.9 in the Senate compared to 145.7
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the house additional revenues over
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the house the Senate ways Means
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
Committee estimated 3.165 versus 3.11 so
 
00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
that's another 55 million dollars of
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
additional general education trust fund
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
what the house had when they were
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
developing their budget
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
cumulative ending balance at 239.5 the
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
house had 5.4 however the general fund
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
share of the balance is 3.2 million of
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
that 239.5 that general fund balance
 
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
compared to a house balance of 5.4
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
million uh Senate did not suspend rainy
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
day provision so the 3-2 goes into the
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
rainy day if one bringing that balance
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
to approximately 231.8 the
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
236.2 is what stays in the education
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
trust fund so that's at the end of 25
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
based on the current Revenue estimates
 
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
based on the current education funding
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
proposal and other uses of the education
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
trust fund that's the balance that the
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
Senate leaves the ETF with
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
so you've probably read or heard
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
um you know if you were following Senate
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
Finance uh Senate President with a
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
couple of his statements in public about
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
reducing The house's budget by almost
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
three quarters of a billion dollars so
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
how do they do that we have and just
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
kind of step back a little bit when the
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
Senate began their budget process in
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
April they still wanted to wait until
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
the end of April before they made any of
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
their final decisions so they could see
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
revenues the Senate as you know
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
typically gets higher revenues because
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
they have the later Revenue estimates
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
but they began the process saying that
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
we need to cut the House's budget so
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
this was the Senate when they discussed
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
in public we're going to try to reduce
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
the House's budget this was before
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
knowing what revenues were they were
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable getting below the governor's
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
number getting below the House's number
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
but they wanted to get there in a way
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
where they could still support a lot of
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
the house initiatives and do things
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
typically what the Senate does and as I
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
get to those I can I can show you
 
00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:45.019 align:start position:0%
there's a couple
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
mechanisms items that are used to bring
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
the total budget down and as we get
 
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:52.220 align:start position:0%
through those lines I can let you know
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
one of them if you look on row four it's
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
just an example one way to bring the
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
24-25 budget down is to fund any
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
one-time cost into 23 and because the
 
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500 align:start position:0%
revenues for 23 were so robust
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
with the over 480 over plan probably
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to push over 500 over plan for 23.
 
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
even though the legislature appropriate
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
almost 200 million dollars in the in 22
 
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
out of that balance they were able to
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
absorb some of those costs and so you
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
can see in row four where you'll see an
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
addition of 1.2 million dollars for
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
moving and fit up costs for das
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
administrative services and you can see
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
a reduction in 24 25 so that's one way
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
they're getting down to that 750 million
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
dollar figure that the goal they set for
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
themselves you can see another repeat
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
Das maintenance there were some
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund costs that the house
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
did provide 3 0.6 million a the Senate
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
decided to support that but to fund it
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
in 23 again just those two items alone
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
brought down the Das Appropriations by
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
about 4.8 million but you both the house
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the Senate both get to the same
 
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.329 align:start position:0%
and the Senate both get to the same
endpoint

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:01.339 align:start position:0%
endpoint
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
you'll see on row nine House Bill 1 to
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 case management system
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
house decided to fund a case management
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
system for the child advocate in 2425
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
Senate supported that but funded it out
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
of FY 23 funds so that's the 201
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
and then we get to the big numbers how
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
did you get to 750 million you would
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
probably think you would open up the
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
budget and see large cuts a lot of the
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
programs that you put in that are gone
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
um on row 13 the meals and rooms
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
distribution has statutory Authority is
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
a separate fund to distribute meals and
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
rooms to the cities and towns and that
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
exists off budget it existed off budget
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23 so as you were hearing
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
things about budget growth the house was
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
actually taking a hit of almost 240
 
00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars for showing an item that
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
was off budget coming on budget in 24.25
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate decided to keep status quo so
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
what they did is They removed the
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation Authority in house bill
 
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
appropriation Authority in house bill
one

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
recognizing that they already have the
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to appropriate all
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
these funds and distribute into cities
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
and towns off budget with the current
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
statute it also pulls out one thing that
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
the Senate talked about during their
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
deliberations was when you have a meals
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
and rooms distribution or any
 
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
distribution we have or percentage of
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
tax restricted for a certain purpose as
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
you're developing your next budget or
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
your next budget in your you know you
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
need money somewhere maybe you have a
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
general fund shortfall you're going to
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
look to those restricted accounts to try
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
to grab that general fund Revenue to
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
have this off budget as it was a big
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
decision that the Senate made and that's
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons why they made it
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
on row 14 the treasury the sheeted
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
property so these are all the abandoned
 
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:47.540 align:start position:0%
claims or the abandoned property
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
that individuals who they have a right
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
to usually this is an open Journal fund
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
warrant that's off book you don't see it
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'll show it to you on your schedule too
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
or will account for it during the budget
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
process of these general fund
 
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.949 align:start position:0%
process of these general fund
Appropriations

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
but the treasurer put that into
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
um House Bill one and two and so that
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
brought the budget up by about 5.2
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium however that
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority already exists what
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
the Senate do is they did set up an
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
account for a sheet of property in the
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
budget of one dollar so when we get to
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
the 26-27 budget in in the next plane
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
and you'll see at least historically
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
what they paid but that is something
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
historica has been off budget has been
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
off budget for decades and the treasurer
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
came and worked with the Senate finance
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
committee to get language and to still
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
accomplish what she was trying to
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
accomplish with that
 
00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
accomplish with that
um

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
if I go to row 15 reduce the affordable
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
housing fund to 20 million dollars the
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
house had 30 million dollars to the
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund Senate reduced
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
that to 10 million dollars it's hard for
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
me to comment on the reasons why they
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
make that reduction you can talk to the
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
individual Senators but there was
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
discuss that right now you have five
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars of real estate transfer
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
tax that is transferred into the
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
affordable uh housing fund every fiscal
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
year so that's taken out of your general
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
fund revenues already and so in
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
recognition of that 10 million dollars
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's already going into the affordable
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
housing fund over the binary the Senate
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
reduced by 10 million that was one of
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
the reasons they used
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
17 the group 2 transition Provisions
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
these are the group two changes to the
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
group two retirement Provisions that
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
went back to the pre-2011 or 2011
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
statute when they made all those changes
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the retirement that was a 50 million
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollar cost for the house well to get
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the budget down that was one of the
 
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
large items that the Senate discussed
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
and debated one of the last items that
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
they made a decision on in Senate
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
Finance which will still be debated
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when they have the budget come
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
before them but they removed those uh
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
that change and they did establish a
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
study commission with four Senators four
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
house members and various other parties
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
to look at not only this issue but
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
various other issues impacting the
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system as well as retention
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
of state employees through retirement
 
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.090 align:start position:0%
of state employees through retirement
benefits

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:04.100 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
the next 9 18 deletes the pay down or
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
the uaal the unfunded Actuarial
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
liability in the retirement system
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's close to five close to six
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
billion dollars the house put 50 million
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds to pay that the
 
00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
Senate removed that and then you'll see
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
them allocating various other
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so they had a decision to
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
make do we support that where do we want
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
our rainy day from to be at the end of
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
23 and how does this play into our full
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
picture so there's a lot of meetings a
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
lot of discussions that are happening
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm involved in some not involved in
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
others just to try to get the the Senate
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
comes up with a plan and tries to get to
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
where they're all comfortable if at the
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
end and so that was one that
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
um fell down on the priority scale with
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
the Senate on row 19 New Hampshire
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
retirement system amending the group two
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
Cola group two had a cola put in by
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
division one that cost about nine
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars the Senate decided to
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
instead I think they did it a few years
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
ago where it's a 500 one-time allowance
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
for those retirees who have been retired
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
for five years who are group one or
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
group two and who have
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
um at least 20 years of credible service
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
pension benefits under forty thousand
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
dollars or under they'll receive a
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
one-time 500 payment
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
that one-time allowance is seven million
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
dollars versus the house nine million
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
dollars for the group two so there's the
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
two million dollar difference there
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
and I won't go through every single one
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
of these so don't worry uh row twenties
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars was
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
Centerville 125 relative to Regional
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
Economic Development grants with an
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
annual appropriation so that was one
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
thing that they did put into 24 and 25.
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
when we go to Category 2 administration
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
of justice and public protection there
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
was some small changes for judicial
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
branch about 750 000 uh there was but
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
one drug court that the judicial branch
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
forgot to fund and didn't notify the
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
house the Senate was notified and were
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
able to provide funds so that each
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
company can have their drug court
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
funds Farm Ranch dress assistance two
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars that was the
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture coming to
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
Senate finance and requesting additional
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
funds that weren't requested from the
 
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.510 align:start position:0%
funds that weren't requested from the
house

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
row 29 3 million dollars to Child
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
Advocacy centers that was a big ad in 23
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
for 23 surplus funds that the Senate did
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
and just to kind of step back a little
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
bit when the you're appropriating 23
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
funds when the legislature appropriating
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
23 funds what they do is they hit your
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
current Surplus with a current fiscal
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
year and then make those funds
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing until the next biennium but
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is you're basically
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
grabbing those before they go into the
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund that's what 23
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations do from the general fund
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
so there's 300 million there uh internet
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
crimes against children 800 000 that's
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
on row 31 and then I'm just going to
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
skip some of the bigger ones but if we
 
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
go to on row 35 you remember House Bill
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
639 this is cannabis legislation it was
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
something that had an appropriation that
 
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:01.460 align:start position:0%
passed after the house finance committee
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
had adopted their budget this was a
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
separate bill went through ways means
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
and passed and had almost a 15.6 million
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
dollar general fund appropriation with
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
the Senate's position and vote on that
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill because it's itl they were able to
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
save when you compare house to Senate on
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statement about 15.6 million
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
just because that bill right now did not
 
00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:21.230 align:start position:0%
just because that bill right now did not
pass

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
rows 36
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
Rose in 37 a relative to
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
um again similar to ways means a lot
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
smaller scale but renewable energy
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
funding Greenhouse Energy Efficiency
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
fund right now has statutory authority
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
to spend to appropriate in everything so
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's separate then all a lot in
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
household one which are the initial
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
authorizations for spending it already
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
exists and so the Senate removed those
 
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
understanding that those funds are still
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
going to continue to
 
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.730 align:start position:0%
going to continue to
um

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
operate as they do now it does bring
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
them down closer to that budget goal
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
that they set for themselves
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
40 is the Surplus statement adjustment
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
on our side and the LBA so you'll see an
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
increase in the lapse and I'll get to
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that in a little bit and that has to do
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
with the energy bill that passed in 30
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
so Rose
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
42-46 I'll talk to kind of all at once
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
this is the judicial Council so those
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
members on house finance that have been
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
here for a while uh know that when their
 
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
judicial Council comes in one of the
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
areas which would be reduced first for
 
00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:39.539 align:start position:0%
General funds was the judicial Council
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because the
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
judicial Council can come back that one
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the few agencies that can come back
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and request
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
additional General funds if their
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are not sufficient so the
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
senate in recognition of that reduced
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
their budget not to the 22-23 levels it
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
reduced it to your their 23 actuals
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
which are what they were appropriated
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
plus what they came through the fiscal
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee so you can see on rows 42
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
about 2 million dollar reduction a year
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then some smaller ones and then
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to see on 45 and 46 and so
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
what happened here is that the Senate
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
did reduce the public defender and did
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
reduce abuse and neglect fund sorry
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
contract Council by about 1.2 million in
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
for contract Council another 5.6 in the
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
public defender but judicial Council
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
came back and they asked the Senate if
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
they'd reconsider that action if they
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
would put the funds in the Senate was
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
still holding firm that you can will
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
give you what we got in 23 you could
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
come back to fiscal and negotiations
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
continued and then you'll see in 23 that
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
the final decision made by the committee
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
was almost 6.8 million dollars in the
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
current surplus funds there that can be
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
used by the contract Council and public
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
defender if their budget is not
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
sufficient so it's kind of getting to it
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
now instead of coming back to fiscal
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
later for those two lines big reason for
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
the public defender as you all know is
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
that is a contract the public defender
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
does have issues with finding attorneys
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
and compensating attorneys to provide
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
that defense and so that was one area
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
they were willing to fund
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
50 and 51 is more just a reflection of
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative process there are things
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
there are items in hospital one and two
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
that may also have a separate bill going
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and
 
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
depending what happens to that bill
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some actions in
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
hospital one and two and vice versa
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
here's one we will have on row 50 a
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars removed to the bail
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
condition status system from house bill
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
2. so that when we did the initial
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance Surplus statement it was
 
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
a little
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the Appropriations were one million
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
dollars lower but because in row 51 and
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
House Bill 610 there was a floor
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed on the center
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
floor the next day to fund that system
 
00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:54.539 align:start position:0%
out of that bill so it's something that
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
came back onto our Surplus statement and
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
that's how if you were to look at the
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
531 Circle statement in the 6-2 that's
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
the change right there and then there
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
was another bill that I can talk after
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
about it had to do with the Department
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
of environment services at division one
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill that was retained so that saved
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
about 250 000 from the Senate position
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
back on last week
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance was added back
 
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
that is something as you remember it was
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposal deleted in
 
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:24.260 align:start position:0%
the house proposal Senate right now has
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
1.4 million dollars again we are this is
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate finance budget proposal there
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
will be discussion on all these items
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I'm sure there'll be floor
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
amendments on some of these items as
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
well row 53 is funding DMV protective
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
glass was a hundred thousand DMV came in
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
and had close to seven million dollars a
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
request the house thought well I mean
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
the senate senate finance will give you
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
your most important so priority wise was
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
row 57
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
on row 60 uh the fish and game fund Fish
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
and Game fund ended the house budget
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
with a positive balance I think it was
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
in the four to five million dollar range
 
00:23:06.299 --> 00:23:07.610 align:start position:0%
in the four to five million dollar range
um

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game came back to the Senate and
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
asked them to fund the pay raise so can
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
you fund instead of having Fish and Game
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
fund the pay raise that is in the house
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
bill too can you fund that for uh fish
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
and game so we don't have to use fish
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
and game funds revenues are pretty flat
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
and the Senate said no
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
um and that was the end of it for a week
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
until right near the end they continued
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
to have those conversations and instead
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
of providing the money uh specifically
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
to the pay increase which would have
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
been basically opened up the box of the
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
highway fund and all the other dedicated
 
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
funds what they did decide to do was
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
provide a general fund support through
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
the fish and game fund to leave a bigger
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
cushion at the end of the biennium in
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the event that revenues and Fish and
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
Game do go down
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
um reduced invest New Hampshire on row
 
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.909 align:start position:0%
um reduced invest New Hampshire on row
64.

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
64.
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
I think the governor had 30 million
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
house had 15 million this drops it down
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
to 10 million dollars one of those
 
00:24:00.169 --> 00:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
reasons is you're going to see coming up
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
under HHS instead of funding investing
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they decided to fund a housing
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
Champion program which is actually two
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
below but also 10 million dollars they
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
received a lot of requests for shelter
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
rates at homeless shelters and also for
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
cold weather shelters and hotel stays
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
and so instead of funding the affordable
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
housing fund and invest New Hampshire
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
they decided to fund these other
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
programs you can see that five million
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
dollars on row 66 funding housing
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
program the housing Champions program
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
which I believe was Senator Perkins bill
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
which was higher I think it was in the
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
29 million dollar range well what they
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
decided to do is to offset that invest
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with funding that new
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
program see how it works and then you
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
know have a discussion at a later date
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
up to 65 is a Pulp and Paper
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
stabilization Center Finance was
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
approached by a couple of the
 
00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:52.549 align:start position:0%
approached by a couple of the
um

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
the paper the form paper factories or
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
the Mills up in the North Country I
 
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
think there's one in the western part of
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
the state too on trying to help them
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
with that industry since they are taking
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
a hit and so the Senate did decide to
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
provide more than a half billion of 23
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
to fund that
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
room 68 Chris McAuliffe Memorial the
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
Senate moved back to what the governor
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
had about 500 000 uh they deleted the
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
State library book removal funding of a
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was funded in the
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
governor in the house
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
they added funds for the Northwood
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
Meadows Dam of a million dollars they
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
added funds for 18 million dollars these
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
are all about a surplus for the Cannon
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
Mountain Tramway which is a separate
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that the Senate tabled in
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate was in a similar position as
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
the house house finance will definitely
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
remember they have 50 plus bills before
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
them as they're debating the budget
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
there was over three billion dollars of
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation bills that came in in
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
addition to the budget and so the House
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
and Senate had an extra task to go
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
through and to prioritize which ones
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fund what the Senate does
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
is they'll go they'll pass it out of the
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
committee and then table it on the floor
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
and discuss it in the budget so the
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain was one of those Hampton
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
Beach pier study it was two million
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
dollars that was table they decided to
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
give 150 000 for the Hampton Beach pier
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
study but more focused on accessibility
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
of Hampton Beach State Park for all
 
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.130 align:start position:0%
of Hampton Beach State Park for all
users

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
users
 
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.169 align:start position:0%
users
um

00:26:14.169 --> 00:26:14.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
Bruce 75 is the Hazardous Waste cleanup
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
fund statutory already exists at story
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
Authority already exists and then you're
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to see from row 76 through 80.
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
removal of federal funds from the budget
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
in total that's over 100 million dollars
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
of federal funds that the Senate removed
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
from the budget understanding that
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
number one these are drinking and clean
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
water State revolving loan funds from
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government related to the
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
bipart bipartisan infrastructure act so
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
these aren't your standard
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
run-of-the-mill annual clean water
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
drinking water federal funds these are
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
specifically related to the bipart
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
partisan infrastructure law as a result
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
because they are temporary the Senate
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
removed them out understanding that Des
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
can come back to a fiscal committee for
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
that so just between the meals and rooms
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
change and this change that's close to
 
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.269 align:start position:0%
change and this change that's close to
um

00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
200 about 100
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
almost uh 350 million dollars with those
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
two lineups alone moving the meals and
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
rooms back off budget and taking these
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
out so that that gets into their 750
 
00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:20.539 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
cut that they ended up coming to
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um food 81 and 82 you'll remember that
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
the house funded a food waste disposal
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
position about 100 Grand in 25 the
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
Senate removed that and they funded the
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste management fund at 1 million
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
instead of 2 million but they also
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
allowed that fund to be used to fund
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
that food waste disposal position so it
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
just chose a different way to get there
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
with a lower dollar amount that they're
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
willing to provide
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
um on page four these are all new when
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
you see some of these lines 83 84 85 86
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and 87 these are all one-time
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from 23. when you're
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
looking through Hospital one and you see
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
it growing from 400 plus sections to 605
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
sections which is immense for a bill
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
um each one of these funds has two
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
sections because it's the appropriation
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
plus it's the effective date because so
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
you do we have 189 I think we counted
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
effective dates of June 30th 2003
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
related to Appropriations throughout
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. so if you cut those off
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
you're back closer to that 400 number
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
but all these new ones are all two or
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
three sections that are added to hustle
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
two that's how uh hustle 2 grows so
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
large as far as sections cyanobacteria
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
mitigation loan funds provided a million
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
pfas remediation fund grants a 2 million
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
Nashua Litchfield which was a separate
 
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:44.900 align:start position:0%
bill there's an interconnection project
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
9.7 million dollars
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and Fisheries was about
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
ten thousand ten thousand dollars
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
surface water setbacks and then the
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
water assistance natural disaster
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
program they did two things they decided
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
to remove it out of 24 or 25 but not
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
fund at 5 million to fund at 500 000 so
 
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.789 align:start position:0%
fund at 5 million to fund at 500 000 so
they're

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
um two uh decisions that they made there
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
under transportation Rose 93 and 94 the
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
house provided additional funds to match
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds that became
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
available for the rural and urban
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
Transit match in 20 in 24 25 is what the
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
house did the Senate decided to match
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
these funds we're going to use surplus
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
funds from 23 from Journal fund and so
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
that's why there's an addition of 1883
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
and 23 to fund both those years and then
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
the corresponding reduction so they
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
still support the house position it's
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
from the different bucket on row 94
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
Mechanical Services Bureau of equipment
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
the house provided almost 4.8 million
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
dollars of additional funding and
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
general funds to the Highway Department
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
of Transportation the Senate supported
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
that but again moved it back to 23 they
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
were able to support the house but also
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
to keep their budget down
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
and then on row 98 Senator Dell Center
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
had a bill for 40 million dollars we did
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
this a couple years ago we being the
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
legislature where we provided additional
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
funds for municipal Bridges and
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement funding I think it was about
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
40 million Senator Dalessandro's bills
 
00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
with 40 the Senate agreed Senate
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
finances agreeing to give him 10 million
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
for additional Municipal Bridge
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in 10 million additional
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
abortionment funding goes to cities and
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
towns and then HHS
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
the two big ones coming at you when you
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
look at category five and six on a pie
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
chart representative Wilder likes his
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
pie charts if you look at category and
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
five and six there are over two-thirds
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the budget just those two categories
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
health and uh Social Services
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
Pro 102 they decided to reclassify some
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
youth counselor positions initially it
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
was over two million dollars that the
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
department asked for Senate Finance
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
decided to give him half of that so look
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
at a million dollars to reclassify the
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
youth counselor positions to help with
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
some of that Recruitment and Retention
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
they did fund on row 133 so new center
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
overtime funding and then on row 104 251
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
family service specialists this is one
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
of the top priorities in order to
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain family service
 
00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:08.899 align:start position:0%
specialists at dsweb they needed to uh
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
reclassify and so this is almost 2.2
 
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:13.940 align:start position:0%
million to do that
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
105. two things happened here this is
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
the new heights integrated eligibility
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility audit the house did fund
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
that 839 000 in total funds and general
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
funds in 24. the Senate was provided new
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
information by HHS that that cost had
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
come down so it dropped down to 168 000
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
but they decided to fund that out of um
 
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.649 align:start position:0%
but they decided to fund that out of um
23

00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
when I say that Senator also benefits
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
from later Revenue estimates they also
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
more accurate predictions of spending
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
levels from the agency so you're going
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
to start to see some reductions in HHS
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
because of a Actuarial study on Medicaid
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
Care Management because contracts coming
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
back which the actual cost so they
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
benefit from all that information just
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
as the days progress and so they did
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
find out on rows 106 and 107 that we can
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
reduce General funds almost 2.9 Million
 
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:12.980 align:start position:0%
dollars for
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
consultation and strategic efforts and
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
move that to um
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
reduce the general funds and just add
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
federal funds to find that federal funds
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
did become available
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
108 is a federal data services Hub
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's required by the federal
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
government but no funding so they did
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
provide a million dollars in 25. 109 is
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
your state phase down funding this is
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
your part D this is your clawback
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
there's 100 different terms for it but
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's a dually eligible Medicare and
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients for their drug costs
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
this is an item where fiscal committee
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
if you sit on fiscal you'll remember HHS
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
coming with a couple Statewide transfers
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
this is one of the lines they're usually
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
transferring into because of the
 
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
enrollment and the cost they are
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
required to pay out of General funds
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
this was one of the top two priorities
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
of the department so they added 15
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
million over the biennium for that
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
110 was a benefit that the Senate
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
finance committee had that the house did
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
not have and that was information and it
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
was an Actuarial study of a cost not
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
only the projection costs of enrollment
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
but also the cost of care the uh for the
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
member per month cost under the Medicaid
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
Care Management program
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
so they were able to reduce their budget
 
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
by 41.8 and 46.3 so almost 80 88 million
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
dollars of reductions that still provide
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
the same level of services that the
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
house provided just with the updated
 
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.450 align:start position:0%
house provided just with the updated
revenues

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:34.460 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.990 align:start position:0%
revenues
Medicaid

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
management information system mmis
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
that's 1 11 and 112. Governor had a 23
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 20 million dollars
 
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:45.140 align:start position:0%
house put it into
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
24.25 and with the federal match because
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
the Senate was going with uh to reduce
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
their budget they decided to fund it how
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
the governor did one time out of 23
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
provide the ability for HHS to go to
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
fiscal to accept those federal funds so
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
that line alone that was another 87
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars that they could bring
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
their budget down but still support The
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
house's position
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
um 113 and 114 are small these are arpa
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
funds these are the only two arpa funds
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
other than the bipartisan infrastructure
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
law the only two arepa funding and as
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
you there's
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
more than there's probably four billion
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funds in the budget
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's only two small Harper ones in
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
here of you know 600 almost 1.2 million
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
dollars so those were removed to come
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal and use that process
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
because arpa's not going to be here
 
00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:34.790 align:start position:0%
because arpa's not going to be here
forever

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
it feels like it's been here forever but
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's going to go away eventually so uh
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
115 and 116 is Glenn Cliff home
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
Glencliff home does take care of the
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
elderly with some behavioral health
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
issues and other needs developmental
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities Etc
 
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
they are funded with a general fund but
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
they also receive patient income but if
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
their census is down which it is they're
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
not going to get that agency income and
 
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
then they recognition of that the Senate
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
provider involves you 0.2 million
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds so that they
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to reduce their budget
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
because their census is down and they're
 
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:08.810 align:start position:0%
because their census is down and they're
um

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
the income will be lower because they
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
still have your same fixed costs of fund
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
crisis stabilization services in the
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
house bill one that's another five
 
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:20.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars that the Senate provided
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
and then rows 118 119 and 120 is
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
something that division three in-house
 
00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
Finance try to address this is
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
developmental Services acquired brain
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
disorder and children in-home supports
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
so there is a dedicated fund for these
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that is restricted
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
continually appropriate and non-lapsing
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the Department
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
the house recognized this they were able
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
to reduce some general funds
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to budget the These
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
funds from the dedicated fund but also
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
the federal match and so they did
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
so on row 118 you can see a reduction of
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars what happened is the
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee was approached
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
by HHS saying that they were talking to
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
administrative services and then carry
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
forward those funds in budgeting them as
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
agency income could cause some issues
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
they're more comfortable if you were
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's a footnote if you go into those
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
lines and I can email whoever's
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
interested there's a footnote on those
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
lines recognizing that the amounts
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate in a house will one are in
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
addition to those funds that are going
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
to be carried forward and it's higher
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
than this 51 and the the five almost 56
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably 70 million dollars of
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
funds that are sitting there in these
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that weren't spent for
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
Dede ABD and in some supports a lot of
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
that because of utilization but also the
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
inability to find people to provide that
 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
care but those funds automatically
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
caring for with statute so between that
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the other funds that's another 65
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
million that the house was able to so
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
the Senate finances was able to reduce
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
their budget by but still support The
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
house's position
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
um there was some other funding for New
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital security about three
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand three hundred fifty
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.089 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
um

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:07.700 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unwind funding so this is the
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
result of the public health emergency of
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
the emergency going away on National
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
level there was the governor provided 16
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars because that that ended
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency ended and people
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
are de-enrolling unenrolling from
 
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicaid they initially this
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
HHS the governor decided to put 16
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars aside in 23 just in case
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
well that just in case never came to
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
fruition so that 16 million they did not
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
have to spend for Medicaid unwind HHS
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
does believe their budget Appropriations
 
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
are sufficient and just relative to DD
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
because DD is one of those developed the
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
services and development with
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
disabilities one of those big items in
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
one of the second largest funding items
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
in HHS when you compare it to 2223 even
 
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
with that reduction of the 56 million
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
dollars from those dedicated funds even
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
though it's still available it's still a
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
22.6 increase over 22 23 dollars so so
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
that as in Rec there are plenty of funds
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
the department was comfortable so I just
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to before I moved on mentioned
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
that TANF maintenance of effort funding
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
on row 125 is another 500 000 that they
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
added the house had reduced they asked
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
for it back they being HHS increased
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
funding for system of care residential
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
rates you're a member of four Amendment
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
a DOT believe there's a four amendment
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
in the house that added 5 million to the
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
the HHS came back to the Senate asked
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
them if they're willing to add
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
additional money and they did they added
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
another 11 and a half so the 16 and a
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
half in House Bill too for the system of
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
care in total between one and two for
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
system of care I think it's about 67
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars of support for that
 
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.589 align:start position:0%
million dollars of support for that
program

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
127 is homeless Services that's 10
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
million so when you're looking at your
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
reductions of the house affordable
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
housing Fund in those other areas this
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
was one place the senator Bradley
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
thought was a bigger need for Senate
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
Finance when they were having their
 
00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:01.790 align:start position:0%
Finance when they were having their
debate

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and he thought eight million dollars
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
for shelter rates for homeless shelters
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
and two million dollars that will go up
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
to cities and towns to help them in the
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
event there are any homeless shelters
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
you can at least provide people with
 
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:14.900 align:start position:0%
cold weather
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
shelter in an hotel or other other areas
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
and then I will run through just kind of
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
the big ones Early Childhood mental
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
health health that's row 130 that's a
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars home visiting programs
 
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
about 450 000
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh 2 million for Family Resource Centers
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
the both the House and Senate and House
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 have a million dollars a year and
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
24.25 already this is an additional 2
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 23 so it's a total of
 
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:44.780 align:start position:0%
4 million across those three years
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
recovery friendly Workforce program of
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
2.1 million dollars that was something
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
the Senate was approached I Believe by
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's office says one program I
 
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
offered the house removed I'd like to
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
have it back in and that's something
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
they agreed they would do juvenile grief
 
00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer Services about 500 000
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Diversion on row 135 there are
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
funds in the budget for Juvenile
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
Diversion the department did ask for an
 
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:10.990 align:start position:0%
Diversion the department did ask for an
additional

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
additional funds so what the Senate
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
decided is they'll give them 600 000
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
from 23 in addition to their budget
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
amounts but also another 300 000 a year
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
and 24.25 to provide those Juvenile
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
Diversion services in the counties
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh 136 and 137 those house members have
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
been around here for a while Senator
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
Dallas Andrew for years probably over 12
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
years now has been pushing to have
 
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
Foster grandparents in congregate
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
housing and passed uh added back into
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
the budget it's been suspended those two
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
programs along with continuing along
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
with graduate medical education programs
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
for since 2011 uh the Senate initially
 
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:49.220 align:start position:0%
said no in the uh denied uh
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment but later on in the week they
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
came back and decided we will provide
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
you with for the next biennium for 24.25
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
with Foster grandparent funding about
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars in
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
congregate housing of about one and a
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
half million for the next two years it's
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
about 750 a year
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
funded a new system of care for healthy
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
aging so not for the children which the
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
regular system care is really geared
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
towards but this is for the elderly
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
aging population
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
it funds Public Health Department
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
vaccine Administration for standard
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines for any public health
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
department that needs assistance and
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
isn't receiving Federal sport to do that
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
they do have some general funds here you
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
do have Medicaid coverage programs for
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
mothers so this is row 140. you'll see a
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
negative 200 in the house column and
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's because the house provided two
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for postpartum
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
care for Medicaid Medicaid postcardinal
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
care the Senate deleted that but funded
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
it at six hundred thousand dollars in
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
23. so 600 of that 1.45 million is
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
related to postpartum care the other
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
funds are related to donor breast milk
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
Doula care and other services to women
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
WIC Farmers Market nutrition programs on
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
row 141 the six hundred thousand dollars
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
of General funds in addition to the WIC
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
funds that are available
 
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
um from the federal government brain
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
health public awareness 142 there was
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
also a Senate bill that they
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated five hundred thousand
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
dollars in 23 to fund that one of the
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
larger Appropriations that they had and
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
they added near the end of their process
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
and a finance process row 143 is child
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
care Workforce assistance there was a
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that appropriated I think
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
was 15 million dollars but it was an
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
um an ongoing Child Care Workforce
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
Development Fund the majority of the
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
finance committee decided we support it
 
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to make it an ongoing
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
program we know we have funds in 23 that
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
you can use over the next couple of
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
years so we're going to appropriate 15
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the purpose of
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and retaining Child Care
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce using the structure of that
 
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
child Workforce Development Fund just
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
not setting it up in RSA and making an
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
ongoing win programs graduated Public
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
Assistance the so-called benefit Cliff
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
another 200 000 was appropriated and
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
then a small one 145 it's small for 46
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
048 but what it does is doit and Fish
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
and Game need some assistance from
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology and
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
they were willing to pay for it if the
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislature paid for it so the
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
legislature did provide certain Finance
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
they provide this to them
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
category 6 is where you're going to see
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of your big changes from the
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund and as
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
I stated previously the big decision and
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
was one of the the decisions that
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
happened near the end was
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
we as the center finance committee where
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
are we comfortable with this tax Blitz
 
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:41.900 align:start position:0%
in Senator Bradley was
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
59-41 not which is roughly current law
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
between general fund and education trust
 
00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
fund of business taxes not 60 40. not
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
rounding up not going anywhere else so
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
it was 59.41 that is put into statute
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
that way that actually makes it easier
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
for Dra to report because now when the
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
business tax come in they'll be split to
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
the various pots instead of the current
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
system where they have to look at which
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
tax is applied which year when was it
 
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
increase and how much goes to each one
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
so but what you're going to see in rows
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
149 and 150 has a no net impact here
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
general education trust fund on a
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
combined basis but does impact each fund
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
your other state aid your building a
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation special
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
education building a lease was going to
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
be moved to the education trust fund
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
based on that decision at the standard
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
Finance keep the status quo in the split
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
so that's a reduction in general funds
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
of 89.2 and 89.4 doesn't really help
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
them get to the at 750 million Target
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
that they had because you're going to
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
see in the second line education trust
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
fund because currently in 23 building a
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
tuition Transportation special ed are
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
funded from the general education trust
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
fund it was moved back so that's a net
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
zero adequate education Aid including
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
Charter School tuition they added
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
roughly if you take into the the two
 
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.329 align:start position:0%
roughly if you take into the the two
lines

00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
the one below it is a surplus statement
 
00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
adjustment based on the house proposal
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
and education funding so it's about
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
eight and four it's almost 12 million
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
dollars that was added relative to
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
adequate education and I'm going to do a
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
terrible job explaining what this does
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
Mickey's behind me and feel free to talk
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
to him after but basically the Senate
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
was in a position where the house knows
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
what the Senate proposed and the house
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
had their own proposal and they wanted
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
to put more of the money to the property
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
of poor communities the Senate was put
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
in a position where they wanted to do
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
but they wanted to get rid of the
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant unfortunately when
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
you get rid of the stabilization Grant
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
you're creating the same communities
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to keep
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
hold hold harmless and keep whole and
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
provide the additional money to
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
so Senator Lang worked with Senator
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
Bradley and department and the
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office to come up with in met
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
with a couple of the house members to
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
come up with their plan to Target uh
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
some of those additional funds yes
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
increase base adequacy but put more of
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
the funding put a lot of funding into
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
those um it's called extraordinary needs
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
which is based on free and reduced lunch
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh man I believe the property tax
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
evaluation per pupil so that was a big
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
change even though it shows a small
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
amount here you'll notice in the end of
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
this packet is a town by town that shows
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
the three proposals so
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's more than just the dollars when it
 
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:24.500 align:start position:0%
comes to education funding
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
153 reducing tuition and transportation
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
Aid of about 4.4 million dollars they
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
were approached I Believe by the
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
department and with just some concerns
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
of a maintenance of effort and ongoing
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort once you're at a
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
certain level in tuition Transportation
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
you have to maintain that as a result
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
the Senate did take this reduction of
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
about 4.4 of the by name again
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
centimates tomorrow I'm sure there'll be
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
four amendments on a lot of these issues
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
where you'll see that reduction uh court
 
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
ordered placements 1 454 and 155 similar
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
to 149 150 is more just moving court or
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
places back to education trust fund
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
where it is now because they didn't
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
change their splits uh episode of
 
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:06.829 align:start position:0%
change their splits uh episode of
treatment

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me that was a house bill the
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
house decided to fund that as 4.1 and
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
5.1 and that's related to court order
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
placements but also special education
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
services for those kids who can't
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
receive those services in in the public
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
school and need an outside entity
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
these are additional funds right now the
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
school districts are absorbing those
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
costs in their existing budgets and so
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
this the house did decide to provide
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
almost 9.2 million to take care of this
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
issue uh senate had pulled that out and
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
then later on in the process decided to
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
fund it and similar to court order
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Replacements to fund it and special Aid
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
to fund it from the education trust fund
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
so they appropriate 19.2 million in 23
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
for the next biennium per episode of
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
treatment so they support The house's
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
position on episode of treatment and but
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
they'll fund it in a different manner
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification 158 this
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
is related to your free and reduced
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
school lunch population Medicaid direct
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
certification will kind of cut down a
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
lot of that paperwork for the cities and
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
Community School Districts relative to
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch meals and
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
applications it was something that the
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
house had proposed there was also a
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
separate bill the Senate decided to
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
remove that and to establish a study
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
committee not only on Medicaid direct
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
certification but also on the increase
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
to their free and reduced lunch
 
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:25.460 align:start position:0%
threshold of the federal poverty level
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
so as far as this budget's concerned
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
there was about 320
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
000 that was budget because the larger
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
impact of Medicaid direct certification
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
happens next by any because it does
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
require uh Federal approval and some
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
startup time for the districts to get
 
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
ready so right now again this is one
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
item we'll be debated on the floor
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but as of right now the center
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee is removing that they
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
delete it Senate Finance the teacher of
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
the year funding of 250 thousand dollars
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
Sugar River Valley 16161 House funded it
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
with General funds because they had the
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
general funds ctes if you remember
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
recent memory is they were funded out of
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
um Governor proposed funding uh the
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
education trust fund house general fund
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
the Senate decided to fund it out of the
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and 23. so you can
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
see on row 161 but they didn't stop
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
there because uh the next one down when
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's gone Regional CTE when the house
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
passed the budget you had 7.6 million in
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
household 25.
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
when the Senate adopted House Bill 25
 
00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:31.579 align:start position:0%
the capital budget they had the same
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
7.65 million because they made very
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
little change at the household 25 that
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the house proposed
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
but recognizing the amount of money that
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
was in the education trust fund
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
recognizing the additional cost of a
 
00:49:44.339 --> 00:49:45.050 align:start position:0%
recognizing the additional cost of a
bond

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
bond
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's kind of a unique section
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
where it negates the bond authorization
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 25 and instead funds with
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
7.65 so what will happen if both bills
 
00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:56.710 align:start position:0%
7.65 so what will happen if both bills
pass

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
that project for when a Squam will be
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
funded with education trust fund cash
 
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:03.500 align:start position:0%
rather than a bond
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
deletes the division of analytics
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
position that was funded provided
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
funding for new full day kindergarten
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%

00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
know when a Squam I could be wrong but
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
they did put that money aside to fund
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
those on page six computer science

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate added against 23 Civics
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%

funds 168 in educated recruitment
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
program you'll see it on here that was
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill but they are requiring
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
them to identify arpa funds or Esser
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%

education funds that are available from
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
and then provides additional funding for
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner approached Senate
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
Finance to ask for or notified them of
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
almost 21 million dollars of
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
applications they received for security
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
upgrades at Public Schools the Senate
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
was willing to fund 10 million dollars
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
of that out of the education trust fund
 
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
and then 170 the snap for introduced set
 
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:26.540 align:start position:0%
aside because when the house
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
adopted their business tax splits they
 
00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:31.579 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure before
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
funding closing out the education trust
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
fund that they at least
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
recognized the fact that the snap free
 
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:41.180 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch back in the fall the
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
official committee approved an increase
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
for snap
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
which is the food stamps to 200 percent
 
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
um as a result that had an impact on
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
your free introduced count and so the
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
house wanted to set aside 10 and 20
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars kind of just a
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
placeholder because you didn't want to
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
throw the educational trust fund into a
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
situation where those numbers started to
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
require additional General funds the
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
Senate removed that because of the large
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
balance they have in the education trust
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund similar to what the governor had he
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
had a large balance to not have a free
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
and reduce set aside that money is
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
already authorized in statute it will
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
come through the normal uh the regular
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
traditional adequacy calculation and
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
then 17172 are not
 
00:52:26.339 --> 00:52:26.950 align:start position:0%
then 17172 are not
um

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
mistypes there was a hundred and fifty
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a charitable gaming
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
study commission
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and because that was so good Senate
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 51 passed with 250 000 for the same
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
study of charitable gaming so there's
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollars between
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 51 and House Bill 2 to study
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in New Hampshire uh
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
police standards and training 173 was a
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
new court security officer training
 
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
program the Jewish grants approached
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
police stands in training asked if they
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
would certify and train and license
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
their um their officers the court
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
security officers and they agreed to if
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
they could they did need a couple
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
positions and so that was funded by the
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
Senate reduced dual and concurrent
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
enrollment is 750 000 reduction in each
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
year it is above the good trading
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
between the governor and house level I
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
think that the governor had about 2
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
million house had about 3.25 and so the
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
Senate is right about two and a half a
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
year the promise program at ccsnh
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
initially removed by the Senate of 3
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
million a year and then a week went by
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
in ccsnh and other those interested in
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
this program did convince Senate Finance
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
giving to provide three million dollars
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
one-time appropriation for the promise
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
program which is to provide tuition
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
assistance to those Pell eligible
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
students first responded career
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
development program a million dollars
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was a separate Senate Bill there
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
was a reduction to the usnh funding of
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
200 024 and 6.2 million and 25 and that
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
was to bring them down to 190 over the
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
biennium that's why you have the
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
different numbers they were a little
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
higher in the second year so that's UNH
 
00:54:05.569 --> 00:54:05.579 align:start position:0%
will get 190 million over the next plane
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
which is about 12 to 13 million over
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
what they received on the current
 
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.130 align:start position:0%
what they received on the current
binding

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
binding
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
house deleted the interoperability of
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
blockchain program and funding that's
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
one and a half million and then added I
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
think senator
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
in as possibly a three million dollar
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the university system
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to be matched by the
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
university system so that Plymouth State
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
and Keene State received additional
 
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:32.780 align:start position:0%
support So three million General funds
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
they're hoping that usnh will provide an
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
additional 3 million so that Plymouth
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
and Keane will receive the additional 6
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
million once you add that match
 
00:54:46.089 --> 00:54:46.099 align:start position:0%
and then other adjustments this is more
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
LBA type stuff but on row 183 increase
 
00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:51.059 align:start position:0%
the general fund lapse due to Statewide
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
position vacancies it's two and a half
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
and five million not big when I show you
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
the lapses for the general funds the
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
state does have a 20 plus percent
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate high as 40 highest 60 in
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
some agencies so what a lapse is is
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
basically Appropriations that aren't
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
going to be spent and what happens is if
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
you're budgeting over two years and you
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you have the proper
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
positions you'll receive that funding
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
but what happens is people retire you
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
can't fill those positions or maybe it's
 
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
a little longer to fill and so there's
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
what we call the labs basically unspent
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
money and so that's something the
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
legislature looks at and then 184 and
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
185 when statutory Appropriations for
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
the general fund like your abandoned
 
00:55:31.559 --> 00:55:33.470 align:start position:0%
the general fund like your abandoned
claims

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
in any other statutory Appropriations
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
that don't require a fiscal or any other
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
settlements workers comp claims they had
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
to add they being Senate Finance about
 
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
five and a half million over what the
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
house had and that is just because the
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
year-to-date activity that's a number
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
that I'll put on my office will put on
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh separate from any vote we're just
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
reflecting the actuals same with
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
education trust fund 10.3 million over
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
what was drawn on the they call them
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
warrants against the education trust
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
fund automatically via statute to pay
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
for adequacy and all those costs so it
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
was 10.3 Higher by the time the Senate
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
completed their work then no so in total
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
in 23 the Senate did add 80.5 million
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
dollars of additional funds total funds
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
about 30 million in general 50 million
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
in education trust fund 20 million of
 
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:24.260 align:start position:0%
that is that the CTE
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
but they were able to get there with the
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue with decisions they
 
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
made on some of the under funded accrued
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
liability and some of those other
 
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.750 align:start position:0%
liability and some of those other
programs

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
and then 24-25 if you add up your 389
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
and 365 you're pretty close to your 750
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
that the Senate you're going to hear the
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
three quarters the billion dollars in
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
how does that hit the general fund is
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
roughly about 320 million
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
um but that's because of the move of
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
some of your other state aid back to the
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
general fund in addition to reductions
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund increased by 89 and
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
72 again because of the move back to the
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
education trust fund when compared to
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
the house of all those your other state
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
aid programs federal funds 135 and 108
 
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
so almost 240 million dollars of federal
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
fund reductions as a result of that
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law was really
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
the largest ones and then any of the
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
matches at HHS that they no longer have
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
to carry for 24.25 very little Highway
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
funds very little fish and game funds
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
and then other fun changes 184.2 and 158
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
124 of that's coming from your meals and
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
rooms because it does have that fund a
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund separately as well as
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
your other funds for that carry forward
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's how the Senate got to where they
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
um the current budget that they have on
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
page seven is the journal fund and it's
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
more just an illustration of decisions
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
made during the governor's phase that he
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
had what the house made the senate for
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
the three years and you can see the
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
variance of just the revenues themselves
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
if you just look on row six you can see
 
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
that the house 2.08 almost 100 over 100
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
million lower in the Senate but that's
 
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
because of the business tax split change
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that number in ETF
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
and revenue will be higher in 24 and
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
then 1.881 compared to 206 1 and 25 and
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
budget Appropriations following that
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
Labs estimates just point out quickly it
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
looks like the house made the Senate
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
finances making a big increase in the
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
lapse estimate but when you go to 11 on
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
the lap system the government had 129.9
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
the reason the house is at 109.36 is
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
because they had allowed HHS to use some
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
of their relapses on the mmis on an
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis because the Senate agreed
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
with the house or the governor on
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
funding it from 23 instead they bumped
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
their laps back to 129.9 and then added
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
another 30 million dollars in laps
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
because of the house bill 2023 the
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
energy bill which didn't have the pickup
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
that was anticipated so right now the
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
laps estimate is 159.9
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have a crystal ball but because
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the vacancy rate I would not be
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
surprised if that's higher but by the
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
time we close up the fiscal year over
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
the last couple years we're pushing
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
close to 200 million dollars in the
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
second year of the bionic for a lap so
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's just a we don't know how high it
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
will go and that's one of those mystery
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
numbers we don't find out until three
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
months after the close of the fiscal
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
year but uh it that's just something to
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on but apps in any
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislative action any if the lapse does
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
increase that's just additional money
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
that goes to the general fund unless
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
there's other decisions made between now
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
and then
um

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
and then 68.7 going into the rainy day
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
fund in 23 and 3.2
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
revenues if you want if you're
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
interested in revenues or in ways and
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
means you can see on page eight the
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues the split between
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
so these are your Standard current law
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue so this won't impact any of the
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
split decisions or anything so you can
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
see the governor in 23 was at 1.948 with
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
the newest numbers and it's over two
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
billion dollars of Revenue to the
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
general fund which is one of the first
 
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
times we're that high in 24 the governor
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
about one a little under one nine house
 
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
at 1.187 in the Senate at 192. these
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
zero base estimates and then the
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
governor at about 1.872 house pretty
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
close uh and 25 10 million below and
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
then the Senate at 1906 based on
 
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
Collections and but that does show a an
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
estimate of decreases in 24 and 25 and
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
your base revenues that reflect all the
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
action that the legislature took I will
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
not go over Rose knife uh page 9 10 and
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
11 but on page nine when you when we
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
talk about splits and you talk about
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue adjustments and why is the
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
Senate has such a big education trust
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
and balance you're going to see in the
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
journal fund right on row eight your
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
total adjustments so I just showed you
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
the base Revenue estimates from the ways
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
Means Committee on current law but you
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
can see the governor had about I think
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
it was about 75 million dollars a year
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
in additional General funds as a result
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
to his switches on two and three the
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
house had about 220 million dollars a
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
year that went to the general fund for
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit and the Senate was about a
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year because they kept
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
them close to current law so uh if you
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
look on row eight you can see between
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate almost a 220
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
million dollar difference between what's
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
available in the general fund the two
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
months available in the education trust
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
fund and then same thing in uh on row
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
eight all the way up to the right hand
 
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.069 align:start position:0%
eight all the way up to the right hand
column

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
column
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
row nine is all your if you're
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
interested to look through this or have
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
questions let me know it's the governor
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
House and Senate in those areas where
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
you see like if I look to the state
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
employee pay raise in row 28 when you
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
see all the numbers the same that means
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
it was in the governor House and Senate
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
budget if it was in you know wrote down
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
133 you'll see it House and Senate
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
budget for electronic licensing if it's
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
just in one the Senate column that means
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's a new program and so look for a
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
hospital 2 Section these are all in
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill two all these adjustments
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
so there are several pages of that on
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
page 12 just to give you a size of
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
magnitude of 23 spending so counting
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
almost 300 million dollars of
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
expenditures from statutory law but 200
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
plus 20 million plus of Appropriations
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
in 2022. in 23 above and beyond the
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
budget that was passed two years ago in
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
2021 the Senate is estimating spending
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
about 618 million dollars over half a
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
billion the house had about 538 million
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
and this is because of the additional
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's coming in over plan
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
um it's significant and it's not
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
that I've seen where we've had two
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
straight years of over 400 plus million
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
of Revenue above plan but
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
um you know as a result the legislature
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
made some decisions on what their
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
priorities were on what to spend and
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
then in 24 and 25 you can see a
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
different Appropriations adjustments the
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
house at about 168 Senate at 130 again
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
25 million events related to the
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
retirement and then 181 and 143 and 25.
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
and then page 13.
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
and sorry if I'm going slow I did the
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
center presentation about a half an hour
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
because I heard it for the last
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
month and a half so just making sure
 
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
that it can try to give you all the
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
information you have uh prior to their
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
floor vote tomorrow
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
um 23 Governor House and Senate uh all
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
come under an eight million dollars
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
forward Revenue pretty close between 30
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars between the governor
 
01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:42.260 align:start position:0%
House and Senate and that's current law
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
and your Appropriations at about 109.6
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
and then 1146 and 23 you'll see why the
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
Senate is upending total Appropriations
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
because you're CTE because of the public
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund and those
 
01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
other uses so the current year balance
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the governor's 113 house 75 Senate
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
knowing that the education trust fund is
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
going to have a big balance at the end
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
of 25 spent a little more current year
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
balance just current year revenues is 25
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
million added to the 108 on Row one is
 
01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
133 million in the Senate's position
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
compared to 183 at the end of 23 current
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
law current business tax splits Etc
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
we'll move over to 2425 balance boards
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
are the same it's the revenue so if you
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
look at the governor's total revenue
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund and that's
 
01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:30.140 align:start position:0%
assuming a
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
65-35 split 65 internal fund uh 35
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund he's at 1.217 the
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
house at 77.5 general fund 22 and a half
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
percent education trust fund is at 1.04
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
so there's that 200 million dollar swing
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
and then you can see the Senate kept it
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
at 59.41 so it's even higher uh so the
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
Senate has 41 percent of business tax
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
revenues go into the education trust
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
fund versus the 35 that the house had uh
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
the governor had I'm sorry so 1.276
 
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:03.020 align:start position:0%
offset by
 
01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:06.059 align:start position:0%
1.221.6 million dollars in Revenue so
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is growing 18
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
you see another 54 million dollars added
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund bringing the
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
total balance to 187 and that carries
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
fourth into 25 and that's what happens
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
in the Senate you have a higher Revenue
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh Appropriations that are lower than
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
those revenues so the education trust
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
will grow in their clients in a finance
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
plan by the end of the by any uh ending
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
at 236.3
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
excuse me 236.3 million dollars sitting
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund at the end
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
of 25 compared to the governor's 148. so
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
that's uh in the house had they're
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
pretty close remember that set aside the
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
house had about 30 million dollars to
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
make sure the education trust was made
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
whole so they did have to transfer some
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
education General funds to make the
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund hole in the house
 
01:05:54.359 --> 01:05:55.250 align:start position:0%
education trust fund hole in the house
plan

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
we go over to row 14 you can see the
 
01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.390 align:start position:0%
we go over to row 14 you can see the
revenues

01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're actually thesis current law so
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
this is the current business tax place
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
and you can see the governor at 1.2
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
House and Senate pretty close in 23 for
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
Education trust fund revenue and then uh
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
pretty close the governor had 1.2 1292
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
house in Senate within 14 million
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
dollars of Base education transfer in
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
revenue and then about 10 million to 11
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
million in 25 is how close they are when
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
your base revenues
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
and then your adjustments of um again on
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
row five is your total revenue
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments you can see the large the 75
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
million I mentioned that this Governor
 
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
moved over uh from the education trust
 
01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.059 align:start position:0%
fund to the general fund by changing
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
those splits house was at 223 1.1
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
million is what the Senate was because
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
they wanted to stay as close to current
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
law as possible and you can see in 24 25
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
very similar and then the major
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
difference I think you're going to see
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
is in 23
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
are your additional 23 education trust
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
fund Appropriations uh Sugar River
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
Valley winnisquam Public School
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund episode of treatment
 
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
Etc and then there's neither the house
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
or Senate funded on row 14 the 75
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
million in additional School building
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
eight that the government had proposed
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
EFA appropriation reduction that was
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
adopted on the house floor this Senate
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
kept it identical to what the house
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
passed so it's the same funding level
 
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
same parameters that the the house
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
passed on and then you can see the
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
settings it's coming off on Row 18 just
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
because of the balance and that fund was
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
part of that decision
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
row 16 I won't go down but this is the
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
highway fund Surplus statement it's one
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
page it will show you the governor house
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
and Center Finance where they thought
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
the bienniums would end I'm going to
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
jump to 25. Governor had assumed about
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
13 million dollars
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
in the highway fund at the end of 25
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
based on revenues and expenditures in
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
the house budget that was about 7.2
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
million and that's including 10 million
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
dollars in general fund support that the
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
house provided the Senate maintained
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
that 10 million of general fund support
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund and they end about
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
12.4 million because of higher revenues
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
but if some other changes to their
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and then uh fish and game
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
this keeps getting smaller so fish and
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
game has its own Surplus team it's a
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund you can see in 23 the
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
governor house had about 9.2 million 9.3
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
million dollars only difference between
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
the governor and the house or the
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates Senate Finance jumped
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
all the way to 11-3 but the reason for
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
that is because of the two million
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
dollars in general fund support that the
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
Senate provided in house bill to so at
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
the end of 25 the fish and game fund
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
Governor assumed 4.5 million their
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
ending balance house had the same 4.5
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
Senate was closed but then added that 2
 
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
million back in 23 so they're up to
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
Senate point one and that's assuming 7.1
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
so that assumes current revenues and the
 
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
Appropriations provided to fish and game
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
and then on page 18
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
is all the state AIDS the cities and
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
towns and so on the far right is your
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
Aid by category education environmental
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
other Highway funds what the actual in
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
22 was so Statewide 1.22 billion 23
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
budget at 1.31 billion and then you have
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
two columns each for each body you can
 
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
see what the governor provided about
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
1.28 and 1.297 in state AIDS the cities
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
and towns versus the one two and one
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
three house provided one three and one
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
three one three two so almost uh 2.63
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
million billion dollars and then the
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
center Finance provided 1.35 and 1.324
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
so close to 2.7
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
um not really to 2 6 or so
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
million 2.67 billion dollars of funding
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then you can see just by the where
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
they are Senate obviously has a couple
 
01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:48.140 align:start position:0%
one-offs with your CTE
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
and your um I think the
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
9.7 million for the national Litchfield
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
is in there as well and then on page 19
 
01:09:59.209 --> 01:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
is kind of a glimpse into the head of
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
Mickey landergan who works uh with us on
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
education funding and the budget is
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
never difficult enough you always want
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
to throw in education funding in there
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
as well it makes it so much simpler so
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
um the governor had his proposal the
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
house had their proposal Mickey was
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
running various proposals for the house
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
various proposals for the Senate
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
but at each change every member wanted
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
to know well what did the governor do
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
what did the house do what did the
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
Senate do not versus current law and so
 
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
we put this or Mickey put the seven
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
column sheet together that 24 25 are
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
both the same 962 billion dollars uh for
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grants to towns and you can see
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's a town by Town through the end of
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
this presentation what did the governor
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
recommend and how did the towns fare
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
what passed the house and how did that
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
fare and then the Senate Finance
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
proposal the final proposal Senate
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
Finance this obviously still needs
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
ratification in the body tomorrow but
 
01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
you can see the variances between if you
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
were to put if I were to
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
organize them a little differently just
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
for you to see you can see that if you
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
move the Senate Finance column in
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
between the governor and a house as far
 
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
as those property poor communities of
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
those with Higher free and reduced lunch
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
they're kind of right in between the
 
01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.850 align:start position:0%
they're kind of right in between the
governor

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and the house so this is a town by
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
town and we have if you go to our
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
website on the general court website the
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
fourth up top the fourth tab is the LBA
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
you want to open budget and revenue
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
documents and you will see all of our
 
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.169 align:start position:0%
documents and you will see all of our
briefings

01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
briefings
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
um if you click on Senate Finance you'll
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
see all there they have recap sheets
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
where they monitor and keep track of all
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
their amendments they offer as well as
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
every education funding spreadsheet by
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
component that are available as well
 
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
so sorry for going so long but I can
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if you have them or
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
feel free to stop by State House 101 102
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
talk to our analysts we'll get the right
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
person up to give you the detail and
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
hi representative
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so just a quick question on line 85
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
the Nashua Litchfield interconnection
 
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.669 align:start position:0%
the Nashua Litchfield interconnection
project

01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
my talent engineer tried to get involved
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
in that because we have two wells in
 
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.070 align:start position:0%
in that because we have two wells in
Litchfield

01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
and we're told Hudson isn't part of that
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
even though we draw water from
 
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.450 align:start position:0%
even though we draw water from
Litchfield

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
Litchfield
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
and we are part of the sewer connection
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
with Nashua you can do what happened
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
so that I'm going to direct you to the
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
senator themselves
 
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.169 align:start position:0%
senator themselves
um

01:12:29.169 --> 01:12:29.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
sorry that was a it was a Senate bill or
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
9.7 million as opposed to going to the
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
other funds so
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
um that was a decision that the Senators
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
had I don't know the reasons behind it
 
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:41.750 align:start position:0%
had I don't know the reasons behind it
um

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
we'll try to track that information down
 
01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
with you or point you to the right
 
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.250 align:start position:0%
with you or point you to the right
senator

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
could be Rosenwald Rosenwald is one yep
 
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.090 align:start position:0%
could be Rosenwald Rosenwald is one yep
yep

01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.590 align:start position:0%
yep
okay

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
so Mike
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and for example when a lot of this
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
moving money around like like rooms of
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
meals tax for example taking it off
 
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.010 align:start position:0%
meals tax for example taking it off
budget

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
should it also be somehow off Budget on
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
the revenue list like page eight for
 
01:13:16.199 --> 01:13:17.510 align:start position:0%
the revenue list like page eight for
example

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
already is
 
01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:20.689 align:start position:0%
already is
so

01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
um all the meals and rooms the numbers
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and your base revenues already
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
assumed the carve out for the meals and
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
rooms that are going to cities and towns
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
so even though it was in the budget it
 
01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
was as other it was just a recognition
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
of that carve out so there was no
 
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:39.260 align:start position:0%
additional adjustment necessary
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
so basically absent that carve out the
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms revenue and your base
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
would have been 240 million higher over
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
the bike well look at page eight for
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
so there's no difference between House
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
and Senate for rooms and meals roughly
 
01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
for base Revenue correct and base
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
revenue does assume that carve out
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
um to the municipal Municipal fund for
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
that distribution so that 300 so if you
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
look at meals oh it's already gone it's
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
already taken out even from the house
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
side yes even from the house side
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
Governor houses all have it removed
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
already but in the house budget it's in
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
other it showed up as other yes okay
 
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
correct my second question is if let's
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
let's talk about all the moving of of
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
so there's a giant list here of the HHS
 
01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:45.410 align:start position:0%
so there's a giant list here of the HHS
stuff

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um Family mutual Support Services l a
 
01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.590 align:start position:0%
um Family mutual Support Services l a
reimbursement

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
all moving into 23. right yes are these
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing programs that are going to come
 
01:14:58.679 --> 01:14:59.570 align:start position:0%
ongoing programs that are going to come
back

01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
next biennium or these one-time things
 
01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
next biennium or these one-time things
um

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
it varies the homeless Services is a
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
one-time 10 million dollars is that
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
something I would consider that up to
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
the next I'd leave that up to the next
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide whether or not
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fund that
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
um Family mutual supports only fifty
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that could be something
 
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that could be something
ongoing

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.729 align:start position:0%
ongoing
um

01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to find one that could
 
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.669 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to find one that could
be

01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer Services juvenile grief
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are some of these programs
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
although they're getting one-time funds
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
in 23 by the time uh 24-25 by name is
 
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
over they may be ongoing programs but
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's up to the legislature Foster
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
grandparents in Congress at one time
 
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
that just suspension is just through the
 
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.490 align:start position:0%
that just suspension is just through the
biennium

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
um your Medicaid coverage as you know on
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
division three is that something that's
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
ongoing so I think it's a mix
 
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.669 align:start position:0%
ongoing so I think it's a mix
representative

01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't we say it's a bad practice
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
to to fund ongoing programs with last
 
01:15:58.570 --> 01:15:58.580 align:start position:0%
year's leftover money
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
rather than this year's Revenue because
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
next biennium we're going to find
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
it's a practice I wouldn't label it good
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
all of these items are going to be
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
debated in 26 and 27 to decide whether
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
or not they're ongoing I think you have
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
varying opinions on what's the proper
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
way I think the Senate
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
on probably 80 percent of all their
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations wanted to make sure
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
they're one time and 23 and that was the
 
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
thought process behind that they
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
probably do recognize that some of these
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
may continue in 26 27 Beyond but I leave
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
that up to the legislature and to make
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
one last question the item that's coming
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
out of house bill 25 are we simply going
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
to be borrowing less money than we would
 
01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
have otherwise yes 7.6 million dollars
 
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:54.380 align:start position:0%
less correct thank you you're welcome
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I was wondering if you
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
could shed some light possibly on
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the usnh budget uh
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
coming out of the sun on Page Six
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
the reduction uh at 177 that 6.2 million
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh in fy25 uh can you say anything about
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
how that number was arrived at what that
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
what the target of that reduction is in
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
25. you know so the senate had a lot of
 
01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:25.250 align:start position:0%
25. you know so the senate had a lot of
meetings

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
um with UNH both in and and separately
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
the goal of that reduction was to make
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
sure that unh's total appropriation was
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
190 why 190 that was a number
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
communicated to them by a university
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
system that they couldn't live with
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
obviously they would like a higher
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
amount if the legislature was willing
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
but 190 was a figure that they could
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
live with and so the Senate agreed to
 
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
fund them at I think it's about
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
even it's even a nature school year but
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
190 over the two so about uh 95 in each
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
all right so that's all I have for
 
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
questions again feel free to email any
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
members of our staff stop by and ask and
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the floor debate
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we're going to pay
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
attention to see what floor amendments
 
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
adopted that could change this okay
