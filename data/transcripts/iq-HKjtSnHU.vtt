00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
must be temporary
 
00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:25.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
I think the gcts people manage that so
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you representative
 
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.650 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you representative
leishman

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
leishman
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
um what we've done in the past for these
 
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.309 align:start position:0%
um what we've done in the past for these
is

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:04.969 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
kind of redundant with what Mike cane
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
presented this morning and then we would
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
get into some program information
 
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
only to find that the agencies would
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
a few weeks later and the issues were
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
different so what we've decided to do is
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.290 align:start position:0%
kind of
um

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
reiterate some of the points from Mike
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
Kane's presentation focus on a few areas
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about the what the
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
budget analysts do for the divisions
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
and then a little bit about the process
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
and the schedule and then we can either
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
wait to the end for questions or you can
 
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
tell me to hold and uh I'll answer them
 
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
sounds good so what I've put in front of
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
you is uh you may have gotten this I
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
think you've got this from
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman already we've
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
updated it with phone contact
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
information on the top but it's it's a
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
list of our analysts and
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
what agencies were assigned to so the
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
first two columns of this page are
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
division one
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
and even though the agencies are listed
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
under each of our names
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
we can help you with anything you can
 
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
ask Melissa for things that I cover I
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
can help you with things she covers
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
however however it works best for you
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
we've also attached the business cards
 
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.350 align:start position:0%
we've also attached the business cards
which

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
not too many people probably use anymore
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
but it's an invitation for you to feel
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
free to uh call us whenever you need
 
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
free to uh call us whenever you need
something

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
I've also attached to this a list of the
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
division one agencies and this is a
 
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
report that we run called the biennial
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
budget analysis
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the four columns
 
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.769 align:start position:0%
in the four columns
um

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
after the description the first four
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
columns are the general fund and this
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
report gives you the 2020 actual
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the 2021 adjusted authorized and if
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
I could stop for a minute on the
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
because we're still working on the
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
budget before that year finishes it's an
 
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:29.420 align:start position:0%
approximation of what that year will be
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
it's probably slightly overstated
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
because in the actual numbers we have
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
elapsed that wouldn't be included in
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:41.300 align:start position:0%
and then we have the legislative
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
recommended columns
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund share and then the four
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
columns to the right are just the total
 
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.389 align:start position:0%
columns to the right are just the total
funds

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
so as we get the information from the
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
governor's face we can run this on the
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
governor's budget request and see
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
what that looks like for the coming
 
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.370 align:start position:0%
what that looks like for the coming
biennium

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
so you might wonder why they're two of
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
us in division one
 
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
variety of
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
different kinds of information and
 
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:17.660 align:start position:0%
requests and the number of fiscal notes
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
more than half of the fiscal notes
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to do with division one subject
 
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.190 align:start position:0%
have to do with division one subject
matter

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
so we tend to get the bulk of that work
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
so at some point in time they decided we
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what we do
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
we will be present at all of the public
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
hearings and work sessions
 
00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:47.269 align:start position:0%
hearings and work sessions
um

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
that way we keep up with the bills that
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're following
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
will make sure that the public has the
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
correct number of copies and all that
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
kind of logistical details
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
um we prepare all amendments for House
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
Bill One hospital two
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
and then all the other bills that come
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
typically if the division as a group
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
decides to go forward with an amendment
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
we'll have that drafted and that the
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
name of the chair
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
but if any individual member wants
 
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
something that they want to propose this
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll put it in their name
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
we'll keep it in our binder until we're
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
asked to hand it out
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll prepare an amendment and
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
the member will decide I don't want to
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
do it so it it doesn't see the light of
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
day it goes on a big pile back at the
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
office and at the end of the session we
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
may need it later or we just recycle it
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
so feel confident that if you have an
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
idea you can share it with us we can
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
have it in the proper form and ready to
 
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
have it in the proper form and ready to
go

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then you can decide what to do with
 
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.389 align:start position:0%
and then you can decide what to do with
it

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
we look at the house calendar every week
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
to see what's coming to the floor from
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
other committees sometimes those
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
committees will make an amendment to a
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
bill that did not have a fiscal impact
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
but the amendment does have physical
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
impact there may be an appropriation or
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
there may be something that impacts
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
Revenue we keep an eye on those every
 
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
Revenue we keep an eye on those every
Friday

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
um just as to to alert the chair
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
we're not involved with the decision of
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
what goes where but we just flag things
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
to make sure that nothing gets through
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
we have uh seven bills referred to
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
finance now or more than seven but I
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
think at least three of them have to do
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
with division one
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
um regarding the uh retirement subject
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
matter Melissa was in touch with Marty
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
Carlin the other day and he offered to
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
visit the division
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
and provide a briefing if
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
if that's something you're interested in
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
to kick off the uh
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
we also keep the materials on our
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
website currents so that you'll be able
 
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.850 align:start position:0%
website currents so that you'll be able
to

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
within a few days see the the items that
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
the agencies present or things that are
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up materials we'll uh we'll stay
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
on the agencies to make sure that you
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
get the things that you asked for which
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
often happens during the presentation
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see some history or some
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
no no apparently Carol yeah plus I went
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
to the Marty gave a presentation in Edna
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
because this session and I went to that
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
so I've sort of heard it already but I I
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
think it's worth doing again I actually
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
haven't mentioned a little bit but yeah
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:44.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
right here so it's a pretty complicated
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
huh

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.569 align:start position:0%
huh
I

00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
think another interesting guy is right
 
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.350 align:start position:0%
think another interesting guy is right
down

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
who runs our 457 okay which is related
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
it but it's separate from the
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements we want to get together
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
with my contact information yeah do you
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
know I've heard the name yes
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.509 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
so representative is a camera
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry Mr brief introduction he
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
probably had a hard time finding where
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
we were no I apologize if it's a
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions feel free to
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
ask and as I said earlier there's no
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
this book right here just represents
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
what we deal with in division one and
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
you can see all the different College
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
camps Maybe
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
all those are all the different agencies
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
that I've tagged from the last budget so
 
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
this is a lot there and you'll find
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
assistance we have here is invaluable
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
they keep us up to me
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
like a daily basis when we're doing the
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
budget they'll consent a sheet similar
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
to this and it will have all the changes
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
in that particular day and sometimes it
 
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
very helpful as I mentioned earlier I
 
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
grew back there is available for you as
 
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:48.669 align:start position:0%
grew back there is available for you as
well

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you and it's
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
so continuing on with what we do uh Mike
 
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
Kane mentioned this morning in the very
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
end of the package
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
we've got a
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment packet
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
that shows you all the house bill one
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 2 amendments and this
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
happens to show division one
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
which uh because I worked on this I
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
decided to include that
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
but it gives you a picture of how just
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
how many amendments to House Bill 2
 
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
there are it starts almost at the top of
 
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
that page and continues on to the next
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
so we'll have three kinds of
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
three kinds of actions will either
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
Amanda section because we like what's in
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
there but
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
it needs to be improved
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
there may be a section the division says
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
no we don't want to do that so we'll
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
delete the
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
and then there will be new sections
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
where there's something that is budget
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
or maybe not budget related but related
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the overall finances that the
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
division would like to see so we'll add
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
that just gives you kind of a a quick
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the process we'll
 
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
prepare that the committee will vote and
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
then we prepare materials for a finance
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
briefing to the Full House
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's in 210 to 11 sometimes
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the chamber
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of a highlights of the
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
budget uh bullet main points and that's
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
presented the week of the vote
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
um to share with the full membership the
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh the proposed amendment
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
after that we repeat the same process
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
for the Senators
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
and then after the Senate phase we come
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
together and support both the house and
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
the senate for the committee conference
 
00:19:59.770 --> 00:19:59.780 align:start position:0%
and what we do for that is we'll have a
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
detailed change document that shows
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
what the Senate
 
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.810 align:start position:0%
what the Senate
changed

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
from the house amendments then we'll
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
have a side by side packet that's all of
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
the house bill one sections and the
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
house bill two sections
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
that way you can look across the page
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
see what the Senate added see what they
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
so talking a little bit about the
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
process Mike touched on the agency phase
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
they started that last spring
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
they have to update the chart accounts
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they have to get all the positions
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
every full-time position
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the state has a specific record in
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
the in the budget systems and they
 
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:49.340 align:start position:0%
account for
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
step increases
 
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.029 align:start position:0%
step increases
um

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
benefits some people have
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
a two-person plan and then they have a
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
child so now it's a family plan but they
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
account for all that and update that
 
00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:03.169 align:start position:0%
account for all that and update that
information

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
budget development guide for the
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and this is given to them in
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.130 align:start position:0%
agencies and this is given to them in
August

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
August
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
and it has all the nitty-gritty details
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
of what they need to do to prepare their
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
budget and they actually
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
we see class lines in the budget when
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
the agencies work they go a level lower
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
to object code levels so there's a lot
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
of detail in there
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
and their tables in there that explain
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
what the different classes are intended
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
for and it's handy we won't use it a lot
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
but when we're looking for something
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
let me try let me take let me take a
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
shot at it um
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
class 40 indirect costs think of it as
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
an overhead charge
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
so you have a federally funded account
 
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.070 align:start position:0%
so you have a federally funded account
but

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
that activity
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
creates a little cost for the state in
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
terms of personnel I.T support all those
 
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
administrative things so it's like an
 
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
federal or other funds
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
class 41
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
is audit set aside well there's three
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
together so 41 is a charge on those
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
Federal and other funds to pay for
 
00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:39.169 align:start position:0%
Federal and other funds to pay for
audits

00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
it's like .001 percent
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
so you'll see it on fiscal committee
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
items they have that line adding and it
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
usually you can look at the digits and
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
lines up with a total amount
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
class 42
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
need those audits
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
LBA does the Audits and they hire KPMG
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
to do the annual report work and some
 
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:02.930 align:start position:0%
to do the annual report work and some
other

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
some other audits that they engaged the
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
outside Auditors for
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
class 42
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
and part of the confusion is the title I
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
think they call it additional fringe
 
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.950 align:start position:0%
think they call it additional fringe
benefits

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
so if I'm a state employee and I work in
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
an account that's funded by federal or
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
other funds
 
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.070 align:start position:0%
other funds
it's

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's a share of what my retirement costs
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
because if my job is funded
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
by an outside Grant why should the state
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
pay for my retirement
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
there's also a 64.
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
for the other agencies like Department
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
of Transportation they're all highway
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
fund or fish and game and that 64 is a
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
so they're both for retirement costs 42
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
is for people who are currently working
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
funded from another source 64 is
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
for the costs of retirees from state
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
government that worked for like Highway
 
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:27.860 align:start position:0%
your retirement in class 60 correct
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
correct but if it's somebody
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
Des or something that's
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
so Grant
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
there'll be a class 42 and there
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
there could be if it's a split funded
 
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.710 align:start position:0%
there could be if it's a split funded
account

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
and then there's a little bit of a
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
calculation there how much is general
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
so the agent agency phase not much else
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
to say about that except for the summary
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh the efficiency budget versus the
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget used to be called the
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget I like to think of it
 
00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget I like to think of it
as

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
the cost to do what you did last year
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
without adding new programs but
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
accounting for
 
00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:29.059 align:start position:0%
inflation and things like that
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
additional prior priority prioritized
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
needs are things that you'd like to do
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
above and beyond and those are
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized from one to ten
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
an interesting example that you'll see
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
coming up here is there's a
 
00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.380 align:start position:0%
a bill to
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
fund some water grants
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
and environmental services
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that's a general fund cost now those
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
grants have been approved
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
the rewarded grants the agreements went
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
to government Council but for some
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
reason they're in the additional
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs when you would think
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
they would be in the efficiency budget
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll probably have that conversation
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
when we see that bill
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
and that's where uh these definitions
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a real a real real meaning because
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
the agencies will come in and talk about
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget and what they did
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
get and what they didn't get and then it
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
would be interesting for the members to
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
say well you didn't get this what
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
priority was it was it number one was it
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:55.730 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
so administrative services will take all
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
his agency requests
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
bundle them up into one package present
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
them to the governor through his budget
 
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.529 align:start position:0%
them to the governor through his budget
director

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
and the governor will hold hearings
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
usually around the time of Thanksgiving
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
all the agencies come in talk about
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
their budgets and what their needs are
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of input into the
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
the governor will present his budget
 
00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:35.179 align:start position:0%
around I think in his uh
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
inaugural address he said around
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
and then shortly after that he's invited
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
to house finance for presentation which
 
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
he will open make some remarks and then
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
the budget director will remain to
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
answer your questions
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
and that's usually
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
um here in 210 211 and the Senate
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
Finance members are also invited
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
and in the past right after that some of
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the first agencies had started to make
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
finance will start working on bills
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
very soon and then once we get the
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
budget and the presentation
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
um we'll we'll be able to start hearing
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
deadlines page 22 of Mr Kane's document
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
has the house deadlines and I wanted to
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
the last data report is March 30th
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
in order to report the full committee
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
will have will have to have voted which
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
means each division makes presentation
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
so for that to work and get to the
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
clerk's office that week of March 30th
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the week would be
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
presentations from the divisions to the
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
which means the week before that
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
the divisions should have at that point
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
wrapped up their work
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's not always smooth like that this is
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
kind of how it would be in an ideal
 
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
kind of how it would be in an ideal
situation

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
full committee votes
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
we put together the Amendments house for
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
One hospital two working with OLS into
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
the right format
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
goes to the clerk ready to go on the
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
floor and then
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
there's the briefing to the full house
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
before the vote and we we help by
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
preparing the
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
the brief The Briefing document with you
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
know bullets and highlights run it by
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
the chairs tweak it and then
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
we all show up in the in the the hall
 
00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:55.490 align:start position:0%
we all show up in the in the the hall
and

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes it's well it's very well
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
attended sometimes it's not but we all
 
00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:02.539 align:start position:0%
stay in the room in case the questions
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
if if the questions get too detailed we
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
can we'll have our notebooks and we can
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
we can help out with that
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
so that provides about five weeks
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
the thing to keep in mind of the five
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
weeks is
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
there's a town meeting day on March 9th
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
there's President's Day on the 20th of
 
00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:25.970 align:start position:0%
there's President's Day on the 20th of
February

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
February
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh might be might be a difficult day to
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
get agencies to come in
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
and there are possible snowstorms so if
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
you think about the five weeks
 
00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:37.370 align:start position:0%
you think about the five weeks
um

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
it can get eaten up quickly and by the
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
way there's session days sometimes
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
they're two a week so it goes really
 
00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:45.710 align:start position:0%
they're two a week so it goes really
fast

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
fast
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
by contrast the Senate has from April
 
00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
April 7th to June 2nd so they have
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
almost seven and a half weeks and
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
so that's really all I wanted to go over
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of repetitive from what Mike had
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
it'll be it'll be much more fun when we
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
get the agencies in here and they can
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:36.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
they may have more time but they have
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
fewer people that's true and
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
the level of experience I don't think
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this term was quite there
 
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.210 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this term was quite there
right

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
one thing about the senate for us is
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
there are three divisions of finance and
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
we staff all three
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
when the budget gets to the Senate
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
there are four of us and there's one
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee and they're not always talking
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
about division one stuff so we can get
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
other things done
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
and and you're right about the new
 
00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.230 align:start position:0%
and and you're right about the new
members

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.610 align:start position:0%
members
um

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
dig in over here house 10 house finance
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
tends to get into some detail and then
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
we go to the Senate and because of their
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
numbers they're at a higher level
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
and they'll ask us questions and we know
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
the answers because we just lived
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
through it so they tend to think that
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
and it's been a history as long as I've
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.760 --> 00:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
thinking so I do have a couple of
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know if I have to have
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
this one the first one's easy so for the
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
bills that are currently referred to
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
finance are the hearings before the full
 
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
Finance commit and then what okay and
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
then you
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
know the full financing money will be
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
kind of like the 30 000 for about
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
something and then we get down okay
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
every bill that comes to the full
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee is a rule it comes to
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
a specific division of that agency
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
okay so then the other question I had
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
was I'm trying to figure out how we work
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
with Ways and Means because we're sort
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
of going through our process of the
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
budget right but we don't really have
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
the ways and means estimate run or how
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
does that all
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
onto this division for example
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll see them first and I'll go the
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
whole Community don't come with this
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
division recently
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
Susan on it so we'll see that what they
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
have so we have some idea what to work
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
with and then
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes leadership or the chair of
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
the committee will say I'd like you to
 
00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
my good friend Jess Edwards work hard to
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
get as much money for that division but
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
we'll push this to start
 
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
I think this morning Mike said toward
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
the end of March
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm excited to work with you guys this
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
session I did do I started last year so
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
I haven't done a budget session on this
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
side but
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
um at my as Mike Kane had stated I came
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
from revenue so I'm used to working with
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
ways and means on that side so I'm
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
excited to learn this budget side and
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.130 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
the reason I had a question about I
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
noticed in the spreadsheet that treasury
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
has a really big number is that because
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's what they're paying off bonds
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the real spending is not anything
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
like this number right and that's
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
something when
 
00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:13.619 align:start position:0%
when you the parties get together and
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
figure out which division has so much of
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
a Target
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's certain things you can't really
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
do much with like Debt Service so and
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
treasury will make a presentation to us
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
as well and we'll see let's split them
 
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.089 align:start position:0%
as well and we'll see let's split them
okay

00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:30.829 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so there was something else I
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
oh I remember
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to Second what the
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler said over there
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
which is the performance audits are a
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
great source of knowledge and and while
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for February 15th now we
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
have our list of agencies it might be a
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
good idea especially for the really big
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
ones like
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know Corrections one in my
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
office liquor there you go liquor
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
Corrections Etc
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
um to to go through those performance
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
audits right and and because there's a
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
list of problems right boom you know and
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
often they'll say
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
in the previous performance audit five
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
years earlier the same problem is there
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
right so so that's a good thing you can
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
ask them about you know what are you
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
doing about this thing whatever it is
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point because
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
several of us that I have are still sit
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
on pistol and we get notifications
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
performance and financial audits very
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
detail we supposed to say about it the
 
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
mission to do a great job and it's Dan
 
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.450 align:start position:0%
mission to do a great job and it's Dan
mentioned

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes agencies both years without
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
preventing problems if it's any time to
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
really put there to be to the buyer it's
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
when it important
 
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.530 align:start position:0%
when it important
yes

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
by the disappointing thing I mean the
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
lva auditor does such a great job and
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
something since don't get corrected
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
give us a chance for most agencies of
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
of that how do you decide who's going to
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
be audited if everyone
 
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.410 align:start position:0%
be audited if everyone
continue

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
there's a committee for the performance
 
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
audits they make recommendations
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
there's uh Financial audits are more of
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
a cyclical thing
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um those audits we have a an audit
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
section of our website and they list
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
them by agency which is really handy so
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you could find out not based on when
 
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
it happened but on the actual topic
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of Handy and if you're
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
interested in a hard copy if you prefer
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
that they tend to keep most of them for
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
for a long time so chances are we can
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
provide a hard copy of it if you if
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.069 align:start position:0%
you'd like
whatever

00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.390 align:start position:0%
whatever
situation

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
pages so it's interesting good to get
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
the iron copy so you may know it's like
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
the lighter one over there
 
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:36.050 align:start position:0%
the lighter one over there
yes

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
this guy gave me an idea maybe it should
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
leave for a couple of the big ones so
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
hey you'll read the letter one and I'll
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
and that way
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
at least not rather than just sort of
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
take a look if I just yeah yeah that's
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
an excellent
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
so we can uh would you like to prepare a
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
there are other agencies like licensure
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
that had some issues in the course
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
philosopher q a licensure how many
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
different little agencies are under them
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
I know almost everything you need to be
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
be licensed to do in this state so
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's something being overseas
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
with like the character of Suits our
 
00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:42.530 align:start position:0%
with like the character of Suits our
Birds

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.400 --> 00:44:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
both

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
many years ago of the University of
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
Science academic division certain
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
budgets in a specific one
 
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:17.930 align:start position:0%
budgets in a specific one
prevention

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
might show up and he did speaking on the
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
judicial range
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
last session there was a letter to say
 
00:44:27.609 --> 00:44:27.619 align:start position:0%
that possible mechanics among some of us
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
half a dozen would judge it it's a
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
number of things that we accept as a
 
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:40.940 align:start position:0%
letter but not
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations so that means something
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
before the judicial branch are they
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
working to build some of those
 
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.190 align:start position:0%
working to build some of those
specifications

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.250 align:start position:0%
specifications
house

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
that'd be a good fight too might be a
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
that licensing if they don't want to
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
believe because if there's any questions
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
like mascara
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
that was a reason why I thought about
 
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.329 align:start position:0%
that was a reason why I thought about
that

00:45:10.329 --> 00:45:10.339 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
so you already have a good volunteer to
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
and what about we've been around a while
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
and other agencies maintaining private
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
public works computer
 
00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:56.380 align:start position:0%
public works computer
is

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:05.890 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:05.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
or is that uh the oversight the audit
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee or is it
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
the exact process
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with but I can get you
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
the complete summary of how it works
 
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.510 align:start position:0%
the complete summary of how it works
sometimes

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
and then we have them returning to try
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
to progress like the liquor commissions
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
required how to provide a select orderly
 
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.569 align:start position:0%
required how to provide a select orderly
updates

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:31.579 align:start position:0%
updates
 
00:46:45.609 --> 00:46:45.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
to thank the other ones that generate
 
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
now we've had a lot of audits in that
 
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:27.309 align:start position:0%
now we've had a lot of audits in that
session

00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's a good point because you knew um
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of angst in here let
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
me set that up two years from my
 
00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:45.230 align:start position:0%
me set that up two years from my
Institution

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:47.180 align:start position:0%
so if you want to really dig into the
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
budget I'd like to know that I'd like to
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
know that it's your purpose all right
 
00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:57.190 align:start position:0%
know that it's your purpose all right
yeah

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
I don't care anything any thoughts
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're not always as
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
in a few years that's probably not
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
another decade now the legislature
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle before
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
the agency a month it's a the
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
legislature used to not know
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
exaggerations almost require that they
 
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
get permission right
 
00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:56.540 align:start position:0%
and then those chocolates you know
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
agency status but there's still an
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
agency in the state so they have a
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility they shouldn't be closing
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
record stores without some notice and
 
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
record stores without some notice and
that's

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
and that's so a little more transparency
 
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:15.500 align:start position:0%
again I think
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
116 million dollars is something that
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
was fun to just provided to save it
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's got to be a little
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
recent we've had some issues with
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
and they're making some progress again
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
indicates like the last
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
I know every setup
 
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:07.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
especially the ones that you can keep
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
one last thing that I I included but
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
in these three pages the last page is
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
just an example of the governor's
 
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
just an example of the governor's
budget

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
and in the past the committee has worked
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
with this document for their budget work
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
because it has the two history years and
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
it has the position counts down at the
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
so there have been years where the
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
Committees worked with just the house
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill one format but it doesn't doesn't
 
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
give you the history or the positions
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
so that's probably whatever the chairs
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
decide that's probably what we're going
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
