see nine all right we have a quorum
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
10 representative O'Brien is sitting in
 
00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
lashman

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
lashman
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the first order of business is to
 
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
review and approve the minutes of the
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
previous meeting which have been
 
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
distributed are there any comments ments
 
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
minutes okay see is there a
 
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
motion move the minutes second moved by
 
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
Senator gray second by Senator Bradley
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
all those in favor I I opposed all right
 
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we have the actuar cost
 
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis
 
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 align:start position:0%
from um the retirements
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
system that was uh emailed and put on
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
the website this
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
week so uh Mr Carlin would you care to
 
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
make some point out some highlights to
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
us I'm getting copies made for uh
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact there they
 
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
are I'll wait for those to
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:23.189 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
okay so the specific question we asked
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
is this is yeah on the back page the the
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
additions have been highlighted in Gray
 
00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 align:start position:0%
so starting with that one that's
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2259 s uh with the uh was um
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
we received an an analysis on back a
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
couple months ago but this variation
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
would only apply this change to um group
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
two tier B members who uh work to their
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
full age in service requirement Ms and
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
retire under service retirement so
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
vested deferred um non-job related
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
disability that type of thing it's so it
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
would shrink the pool somewhat from the
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
original 22 59s and that's the the
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
bottom uh row on the prior page page
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
three uh the difference the um in the
 
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.909 align:start position:0%
three uh the difference the um in the
new

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
analysis the um the unfunded liability
 
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
impact went from 47 million to 43 9 and
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
the terminal funding cost went from 59.1
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
million to 53.7 million so that there
 
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.950 align:start position:0%
million to 53.7 million so that there
was

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.550 align:start position:0%
was
some

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
eliminating some members who weren't
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
going to be wouldn't aren't working to
 
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
full retirement age and going out on
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
service retirement reduce the cost of
 
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh the other um analysis was
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
related to um senator Gray's request uh
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
which would was to uh increase the
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
multiplier crw uh for every year work
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
past 20 years to two and a half% for
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
everyone in group two so that includes
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
tier b as well as tier c as well as
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
future members of group two so uh and
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
then the secondary question was what if
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
the change was only for tier B so those
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
are those are on page two the two gray
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
rows in the middle of that
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
um uh page show that the and and just
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
just as a refresher too under the
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
projected employer rate increase column
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
which is a column three there there's
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
different sets of numbers the the the
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
plus Point uh
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
xx% um numbers that represents the
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
percentage of pay increase projected
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
over current um or future uh employer
 
00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
contributions um you know with no
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
funding with only the unfunded liability
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
funded and then if possible if there's a
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
terminal funding cost possible um that's
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
listed at the very bottom of that uh
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
item on that third column so for the
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
everyone in group two the Top gry Line
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
question one uh it's unfunded of 18.5
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
million um if that was funded the
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
increase um on the employer contribution
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
rate would be 31% of pay for police and3
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
for fire which equates out to about 1.7
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
million a year in
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
additional uh employer contributions
 
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
going forward beginning in fiscal
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
26 that proposal couldn't be estimated
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
for a terminal funding number because
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's open-ended it's there's you
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
know future hires who you know will just
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
keep coming in under the provision the
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
second question where it was limited
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
only to tier B this change the unfunded
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
was 11.6 million and because it's a
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
closed group uh they could look look at
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
a terminal funding number and that was
 
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.510 align:start position:0%
a terminal funding number and that was
16.6

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
million thank you other
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
you all right now that we have
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
a selection of options to um to consider
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
are there any that we wish to discuss
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
and recommend to the legislature Senator
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
Bradley you
 
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.350 align:start position:0%
Bradley you
have

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I think if you look
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
at the changes to Amendment uh 2259 on
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
the back of um this page and I think
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
hats off to Marty for doing a really
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
good job of keeping the information in
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
an understandable way I just want to
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
give him a shout out
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability portion of
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
approximately $44 million I think is
 
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
getting into a
 
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
getting into a
range

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
consider um we did this two years ago on
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
House Bill
1587

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
1587
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
um so we're me Senator it we did
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
something different in 1587 the same
 
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:37.959 align:start position:0%
amount of money yes correct okay so
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's my point um we're getting it into
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
a financial range that I think um offers
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
some opportunity for
 
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.910 align:start position:0%
some opportunity for
consideration

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
the October numbers are um not out yet
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
but as of I think yesterday's summary
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
for Revenue we were about $17
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
million ahead for October that may
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
change slightly either way depending on
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
refunds or monies that came in on the
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
last day of the month
 
00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:14.949 align:start position:0%
last day of the month
um

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
so I think we could pay for it um in
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
that range
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
of but it's still if you think of where
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
we are in terms of the Surplus with the
 
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
outstanding obligation and I keep
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
harping on this the YDC
 
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.750 align:start position:0%
harping on this the YDC
settlement

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
um about 80 82% of the projected Surplus
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
as of now would be used for this purpose
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
so um I
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
think that gives me great caution to say
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
that so I will just say also in terms of
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's proposal obviously um
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
significantly more affordable and has
 
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
the benefit of um actually doing
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
something for retention moving forward
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
so I I like the idea of um Senator
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
Gray's proposal a lot too and I like the
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
fact that it's far more affordable so
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there thank you madam chair
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
right Madam chair Senator Susie I
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for my
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
colleague Senator Bradley when you said
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
said the 80 million of surplus projected
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
you're not talking for the whole banian
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about what was realized
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
so far I just want to clarify we are at
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
about $53 million of surplus right now
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to
 
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:48.110 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to
allocate

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
allocate
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
43.9 million that's about 82% of them
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
right now of what we have currently okay
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
but you're talking what we have
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
currently okay I just wanted to make
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
camper um thank you madam chair um as
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
far as uh
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
2259 my concern is dividing uh this
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
middle tier up even further um would it
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
be possible
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
to take a look at um looking at the 2
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
and a half% multiplier for the those in
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
the the first five years and then um
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
seeing next session if we could look at
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
the 2 and a half% for um those in the
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
six to 10 year
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
range next session we can do whatever we
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
like there's no way we can can control
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh if you think that we that if we adopt
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
one of these uh if we recommend one of
 
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
these plans we should also recommend
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
looking at further action in the next
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
session that's a a perfectly reasonable
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation but we can't guarantee
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
happen Mr real thank you madam chair
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
um I I Echo Mr campo's point about
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
further dividing uh this middle group
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
and I think it's problematic when you
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
look when you actually look at the what
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
the calculations would be um there are
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
members that had four years of service
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
prior to the changes in 2011 who had a
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
2.2 multiply
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
this bill here would give them a 2.25
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
multiplier uh while it is an increase
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's an increase of
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
05% uh in a year and um I would I would
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
have a a hard time advocating for that
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
as uh the only thing to come out of this
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
commission um I would like to see us get
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
to um the the full
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
2.5 for every member in the middle tier
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
um certainly if we had a a uh a way to
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
to pay for that upfront that is ideal um
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
but I would not advocate for a uh for
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
the the splitting of The Tib members in
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
you all right the next question is does
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
someone wish to rec make a
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we propose one of
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.430 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we propose one of
these

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
schemes to be for the legislature for
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
2024 Mr
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
real thank you madam chair uh I do not
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation but I was uh
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that we might be able to get some
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
further uh Clarity on the senator Gray's
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%
first proposal and maybe Marty would be
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
able to help us with
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
that um I had a couple questions for him
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
if he's available
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the this would change
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
the multiplier to
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
2.5% for all group two
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
members including future
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
hires once they work at least 20 years
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Carlin thank you uh I was
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
wondering if in the GRS calculations if
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
they uh also were able to identify what
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
this benefit would look like if that 20
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
year mark was changed to 10 years or
 
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.189 align:start position:0%
year mark was changed to 10 years or
some

00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
other option uh no they just they just
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
did did the the analysis the specific
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
one that the commission endorsed so I'm
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
not sure what the impact of that would
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
be do you happen to know where they've
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
done a lot of this work already um would
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
that be somewhat of an easier
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
calculation to identify considering
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
they've done the majority of the work
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
um I I could check I know with the
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
original 2258 which was one of the first
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
pieces analyzed there was some follow-up
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
questions and JS was able to answer
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
those without doing the full scope
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
valuation so so you know was it was less
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
of a lift um I'm not sure how the model
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
works for this one so I'd have to I
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them I'd want to
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
reach out but I I could ask if the
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
committee would like
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to mention
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we are up against a
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
deadline the final report for this
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
commission is due December
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
1st and Halloween will take a actually
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
Halloween Halloween already took a big
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
chug Thanksgiving will take a chunk out
 
00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:47.230 align:start position:0%
chug Thanksgiving will take a chunk out
of

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
November and the Actuarial analysis have
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
been running two weeks
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
plus so we're we don't really have time
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
for a new
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
analysis or unless it's just a tweak of
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
an existing one yeah I I could ask the
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
question today probably have an answer
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if this is going to be a full
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
full scope it's going to take a couple
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
weeks or it's something that can be
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
answered before next Thursday as that's
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's what you were yeah next
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
next if we don't have an answer by next
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
Thursday it's going to be very difficult
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
to incorporate it and and the question
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
would be instead of ADD
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
any year after 20 years of service
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're you know and I know the
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
group would have to vote on it but what
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
what you put on the for discussion right
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
now is any year worked after 10 years is
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
two and a half per. correct yeah and
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
that is that for all groups or just tier
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
B that would apply to all groups as it
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
does in in this proposal and I would
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
just for clarity purposes those that are
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
um my intention would be those that are
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
already above that 10 year Mark those
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
years would also be calculated
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
in going
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
forward yeah it it wouldn't be
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
perspective to the date of the law if it
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
changes it's like these people aren't
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
retired yet so we can calculate you know
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
they somebody's got 12 years they've
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
already acred that and didn't know it
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
you know right okay okay Senator Bradley
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I would just make a suggestion if JS
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
is able to calculate it for 10 years I
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
think they could probably do it for 15
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
years years to just so that we are able
 
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.029 align:start position:0%
years years to just so that we are able
to

00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
compare um Apples to
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
Apples okay well right I I can ask the
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
question and if it doesn't you know
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
require a full um valuation and they can
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
turn it around in a week I'll I'll alert
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
you to to let the committee know thank
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
you because either way just if it comes
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
in if it takes two and a half weeks
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're uh not going to be able to pay
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay centor de gr uh just a point of
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
clarification are we asking to do that
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
on the proposal that I made or the
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
proposal on page
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
four on The Proposal you made I believe
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
I that's just you know in yes Senator
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
gray on your proposal uh question one
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
that was added on uh
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
10:31 because I could certainly in
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
spirit of
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
compromise uh I could C certainly
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
support uh bringing that
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
percentage uh to
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
25 um earlier in their tenure uh if it
 
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799 align:start position:0%
applies to Group
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
B uh because we've already done
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
something there um it becomes harder for
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
me to support it if I go back and do
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
tier C
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
also um but you know that's uh okay so
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
again that's just a new Nuance in in the
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
way I'm looking at this is you know I
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at trying to to help both
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
the tier B and the tier C people um and
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and to keep the
 
00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:12.430 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and to keep the
cost

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
reasonable um I have to put some limits
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
on it so well thank you but we don't
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
know what the cost would be
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
correct Senator Bradley and that's
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
exactly why I suggested that if it's
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
going to get run it can get it should
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
get run for 15 years as well as 10 I I I
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
tend to agree with you yeah I I would
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
have been able to say that if you were
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
doing that to 2259 I think it would
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
require a full scope because there's
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
more moving Parts in 2259 because
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a reduction in the minimum
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
age in service and that proposal this is
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
just the multiplier with everything else
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
being equal so I I think the chances are
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
better of getting a a favorable answer
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
but again I I don't want to promise
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
until we get
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.470 align:start position:0%
until we get
to

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
right does anyone wish to move to
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
recommend a plan to the legislature we
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
have two at this point two ways to bring
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
a bring a plan to the legislature for
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
this coming year if we recommend
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
it we can include it in House Bill 436
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
which is retained in finance and if
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
approved by the committee that will go
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
to the Full
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
House in January and then go over to the
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
Senate so that if we make that
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation it could be adopted as
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
early as it could go into effect as
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
early as March L the governor
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
cooperating and the Senate
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
cooperating otherwise we can
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
recommend a different plan and bring
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that in as a new bill we have the
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
authority as a statutory committee or
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
commission to bring in a bill outside of
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
the regular Bill filing period and
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we would have to do but that
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
would start brand new in January and it
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
would not be able to pass until June at
 
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.950 align:start position:0%
would not be able to pass until June at
the

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
earliest Mr real have a question Madam
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
chair does that mean if the report is
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
due by December 1 does that I understand
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's last minute but does does that give
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
us the November 30th meeting to
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
potentially have a vote on this or does
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
that is that too
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
late that's later that I'm comfortable
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
with but if absolutely NE if we're
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
making progress we we could do it but
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm would not want to plan on it could
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
we potentially try to hold off if we
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
don't have this Actuarial analysis until
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
the 16th to either the 9th or the 16th
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to the commission when they
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
think they would be able to effectively
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
work uh the 16th is in my opinion
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
cutting it very close but it it could be
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
managed um I am not going to recommend
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
23rd but the report is in fact due
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
December 1st so we have to
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
be um uh i' the 16th is probably the
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
last reasonable date for us to
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
meet Madam chair can I ask one more
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
question to Mr car while he's still here
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
please um if I recall when we originally
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
got the numbers on House Bill
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
436 the number of tier 2s was about
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
1,830 roughly and the new number this
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
Comm commission has been working with is
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
1731 could you tell me
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
when at what point you cut off to reach
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
the 1731 and what we can expect if it's
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
declining at a similar amount or if it's
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually accelerating really good
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
question Senator and and it it reminds
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
me I I I probably could have done it
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
when I introduced this grid back in you
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
know September to to do a little more
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
detail all of the actu an analysis
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
including the most recent is based on
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
the most recent rate setting valuation
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
fy21 that's the
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
1824 count okay Ju Just because we had
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 22 numbers you know a year
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
sooner I put them on the chart those are
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
the you know but all all of the
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
estimates are based on that 1824 number
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
I did have you know you know we at nhrs
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
had a had a conversation with with some
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the actuaries about that and you know
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is sort of standard
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
practice for all analysis so it's you
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
know we just so it's Apples to Apples
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
sessional recession type of thing this
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
this is how we do this but it it's it's
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
fair to say that these costs are the
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
sort of the top end um if there are
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
fewer people affected by It ultimately
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
by the time it passes there is going to
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
be a decrease in the overall cost and
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to put a percentage on if
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
you say oh it went from 1824 to 1730 31
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's five something because maybe a
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
math teacher here but you know it's it's
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
a percent but it's not that means this
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be 5% less because a lot of
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
it depends on the demographics of the
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
specific members who left were they the
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
newer people were they a year away and
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
they threw it in you know that all of
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
those things factor into it so it's it's
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
hard to sort of extrapolate it but it is
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
fair to say that these are sort of the
 
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
top end numbers and then it it could
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
only be less by some some degree if you
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
know there's fewer people by by the time
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
if something changes so if I could
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
follow up I just want to make sure I'm
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
understanding so it was the
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
1824 is what these numbers are based on
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah but when they went on the chart
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's based on 1731 or 1731 is just the
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
current number I just want to make sure
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no those are that last call
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
those are just the most recent numbers
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
they weren't used for actual real
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
analysis and we we kind of went back and
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
forth when we were setting up this grid
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
which number is better to give you
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
without causing confusion and that's
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
what we fell on and maybe we should have
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
stayed gone the other way but yeah no
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's not I I just wanted the explanation
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
because I just wanted to better
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
understand the cost implications so if
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is based on the
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
1824 and we know that within a year
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're down to 1731 I guess the question
 
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.430 align:start position:0%
we're down to 1731 I guess the question
is

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
then by this time next year would we be
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
looking at under 16
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I I do absolutely understand
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's dependent upon which member is it a
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
two-year member or a 19-year member yeah
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
and and this year this uh beginning in
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
February was the first year that anybody
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
in tier B was eligible to retire the
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
people who would have started you know
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
January very March of o2 I I so you may
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
lose some people to retirement already I
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't think you know there there
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
would would be a huge number especially
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
with everything pending people may want
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
to kind of write it out um but you know
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
there some some people either they could
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
have just terminated and went it's
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
invested the FR status or a few of them
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
may have retired and then obviously some
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
people may have been granted disability
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
benefits you know too so that's those
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
those are the pools of people who leave
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
people who get disabled or people who
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
can retire is what would be coming off
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
the list just if I could just one last
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
thing Madam chair um thank you so I
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
guess the numbers that are before us are
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
the absolute worst worst case scenario
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
the highest possible and we know there's
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
already been a decline from the numbers
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
that we're considering so we're actually
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
looking at something less we just can't
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
quantify how much at this point yes okay
 
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.750 align:start position:0%
quantify how much at this point yes okay
thank

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
else Senator Bradley you have a comment
 
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.430 align:start position:0%
else Senator Bradley you have a comment
a

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.029 align:start position:0%
 
recommendation

00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
else represent Packard thank you madam
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not going to propose a
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation now but I'm just going
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
to mildly insist that whatever we do
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
recommend and whenever we do come up
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
that this is it let's fix this thing
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
once and for all and move on I do not
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
want to have to come back here next year
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
and the year after and the year after uh
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
trying to fix this thing again and again
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
and again so I would just implore the
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
members of this commission that whatever
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
we do vote on we vote on it and that
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
this will fix this thing once and for
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you uh Madam chair uh I
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more than what what
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
speaker just said uh it seems the
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
intention by Mr Colin will expedite the
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
process as best as he can if
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
allowed and I think patience is a
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
virtue and I think if the committee
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
members had the full complete
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of what uh uh Mr will
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
suggests I think we'll be able to come
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
up with something if we live in debate
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
limited to discussion to the proposal
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
and see if that can fly and then I think
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
date so I would urge I I know you're not
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
pleased but I hate to delay it too but
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
again I have to agree with the speaker I
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
mean we've been fixing this for an awful
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
long time so
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
okay if that is the intention
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
then we need to
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
know um whether we can get that those
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
numbers in a in a reasonable period of
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
time and we would need to meet at least
 
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.509 align:start position:0%
time and we would need to meet at least
once

00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
more yep okay everyone understands that
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
I would just yes say Madam chair I'm not
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
available on the 16th so hopefully the
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
ninth will work nor am I that you're not
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
available on the 16 all right well and I
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
will be out of
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
state we'll we so fine then Mr Carlin
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
your charge is to let let me know as
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
soon as possible if there is a chance of
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
getting those numbers in time for a
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
meeting on the
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
9th Absolutely I'll soon as I soon as I
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
get to a keyboard I'll I'll start typing
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that email out okay and we
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
will assuming that that happens we will
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
meet plan to meet on the
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
9th whether or not we have the numbers
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
because we've got to come to some final
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
conclusion and it looks like the 16th is
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be a useful day is that
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
agreeable all right so we'll meet on the
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
16th we will have some numbers we hope
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
the nth the ninth sorry thank you so
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
much for keeping me on my
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
toes all right is there anything else we
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
today oh yes Senator
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
greay are we going to take any action on
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
any cost of living thing um certainly I
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
put out the proposal that uh we rewrite
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
the legislation if it's needed to allow
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
uh the employers of uh group one and
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
group two to uh to do matching because
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
when I suggested that they told me to
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
allow it it would would take
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislation um I don't believe that we
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
that it is necessary for employers other
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
state I mean they can do whatever that
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
as far as I know they can do almost
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
anything that they they like is part of
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
a negotiated contract I see the
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
association of counties agrees with me
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
workers

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay so what would you propose that um
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
again as a a way to uh allow both group
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
one and group two people uh to be able
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
to utilize that and have a state match
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh that uh I would like to see you know
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
out of this commission that the
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation that legislation be
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
brought forward uh that would allow that
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
to be negotiated uh with the unions and
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
then the appropriate
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
um uh recommendation for for people who
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
are not in the union to to uh to get the
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
same benefit as those people in
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
similar circumstances I'll second
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you Mr
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
R uh question for Senator gray if he's
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
willing um are you proposing that
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
everyone in the retirement system would
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
get a state match to their 457 whether
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
they're state employees or not what I'm
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
saying what originally when I
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
investigated this I believe that the
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
answer came back and that said that they
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
needed um legislation to allow it okay
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
um the chair has said that and the
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
county uh Society hasn't uh hasn't
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
agreed with that that it would only be
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
the state employees that I would need to
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
be able to do that with uh but again it
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be a negotiated benefit so if
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
you're representing the firefighters or
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
the police or the state police or
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
whatever uh that would be a negotiated
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
benef benefit along with your um salary
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh that you negotiate and that would
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
come through a a different uh Financial
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
structure than the retirement system and
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
therefore uh that would be the
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated cost
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
so I respect I respectfully withdraw my
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
second I was outside the retirement
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
system I just heard that I'm sorry I you
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
understand it first so in favor yes Mr
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
Ro um if I could just speak to that I uh
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm fearful here that we're getting
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
into a place where we're uh as a
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
commission trying to establish um a
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
benefit that's not truly a benefit it
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
already it already exists we've multiple
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
people have testified to the fact that
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
this is already being negotiated now um
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
there are cities and towns that already
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
have this negotiated now if we're
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
talking about doing it for from the
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
state doing it a matching for the state
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
employees then that's a different or
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's part of the same conversation but
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's not um it it doesn't sound like
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
that's what's being proposed at the
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
moment senator may I reward your motion
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
to say that we
 
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.950 align:start position:0%
to say that we
recommend

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
all all
 
00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:20.710 align:start position:0%
all all
employees

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.190 align:start position:0%
employees
negotiate

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
a re
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
a a benit benefit outside of the
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
retirement system matched by their
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
employer to fund colas and that we
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
submit legislation that would authorize
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
that to be done for state
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
employees we we recommend the same thing
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
for all workers but only the state
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
employees need specific legislation to
 
00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:49.349 align:start position:0%
employees need specific legislation to
authorize

00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
it um does that meet your intent for
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
what you said Madam chair that is uh
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
what I would propose
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
right and I'll second it as that point
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
is any other
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr Fuller and then Mr Martine
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes well at the same time I know it's
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's related to this but earlier I
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
proposed actually a traditional Cola
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's actually funded by the retirement
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
system so I understand that's not part
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
of the motion but just as I mean that's
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
something where I would like to see us
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
more go in that direction instead of it
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
being indir you know then it's not it's
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's a much more Equitable system
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
instead of just have it being
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
individually done by cities and towns
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
that way some gets a benefit and some
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the benefit it's much more
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
clean that way in my opinion all right
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
Mr martinz I will Echo that I think that
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
a Col within the retirement system is a
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
lot clearer easier to manage and and
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
manage and and uh
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
work because we already can do anything
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
outside so here we're talking about New
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system we did had a
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
Col account that we closed 1983 we moved
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
the total probably $600 million doll out
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
of it so we should return to what was
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
always meant to be a defined benefit
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Coler in the retirement system workers
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
have been paying 2% extra since 2011
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we can entertain assign 1% of that
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
to fund e Cola it would be a slight dial
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
down on the payment of the unfunded
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
liability but it would be something that
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
we can start propos this for the for the
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
future I know we cannot fix everything
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
here today but we can have ideas and
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
explore that I think the col Retirement
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
System in summary is the best way to go
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
we all as we had it thank you all right
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
any other M sty yes so thank you madam
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
chair so I can tell you that we're going
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
to oppose that um I think we need to be
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
very cautious of what we're doing I know
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
that in the past a couple years ago we
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
did do a cola and the state funded it
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at colas you're
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the employer having having to
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
come up with that money unless you're
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to be using what's
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
already the employees doing but if the
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
you cannot continue to put the onus on
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
the employers to come up with these
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
colas I mean I've been in the system for
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
30 years I wasn't told I'm going to get
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
colas when I retire that wasn't one of
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
the bargains it was a defined benefit
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
which is based upon what I put in and
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
and is matched thank you madam chair
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
Mary yes Mr Martine thank you uh
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
a cola benefit is not a luxury it's in
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
the same line of payments benefit raises
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment that's what a coal
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
is it's not something out of the planet
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we we say oh we can't afford to do
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
this we have to find ways to afford it
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
because you know that's a person works
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
for an employer that's how we get
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
paid we never intended to have a benefit
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
that washes away with inflation
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise you reti if you live live long
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have zero in the end
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
that was never the plan it was never the
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
way it worked it was never the way it
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
worked we always had the col benefit so
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's not something extraordinary you
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
have to remember we had that all the way
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
to 2011 when was removed from the legisl
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
so we do have that it's not
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary it's a normal and part of
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
the retirement system thank you
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
Brian thank you madam chair um in case
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
some of you do know or don't know
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh the other hat or helmet that I wear
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
is I'm also on the uh the board of
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
alderman for the city of
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
nashille and I can speak wholly for what
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
nashille has gone through because the
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
changes in the state pension system
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't increased the city's budget $2
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
million and to me the thing that needs
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
to get fixed was the previous item that
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
was discussed that in itself could have
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
some cost Savings in the
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities because that $2 million
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
equal 1% of the nashal tax rate okay
 
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
now the state has always
 
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.829 align:start position:0%
now the state has always
had

00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
cers okay as far as you know being a
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
member of the uh
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
nhrs they were given out from time to
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
time I think it's something that needs
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
to be disc discuss but try to combine it
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
into this committee into one thing I
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
think we're getting towards the end with
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
the December 1st deadline and I think we
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
would be best to just to focus on fixing
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
the problem because it does revert back
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
to the local taxpayers if we can get
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
this item fixed so I shared a thought
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
with Cola but I think the duty of future
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
legislation can probably with time
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
equally conquered it thank
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.710 align:start position:0%
you anyone
else

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
Senator so slightly different take on
 
00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.470 align:start position:0%
Senator so slightly different take on
this

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
um there was a cola that was authorized
 
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.150 align:start position:0%
um there was a cola that was authorized
in

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
2019 um Governor sonunu signed it in a
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
law the cost for
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
employers um I believe exceeded a
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
hundred million so that's County Schools
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
State and cities and towns so colas are
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
expensive there's no question about that
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
on the other hand they are an incentive
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
and retention tool so they have some
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
Merit but they have to be paid for and
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
my view is that if we're going to
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
Institute a cola it should be a shared
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility by employers and
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
employees that everybody sees the
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
benefit of it and everybody shares the
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.230 align:start position:0%
benefit of it and everybody shares the
cost

00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that there's any way
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
that we could be ready for a
 
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation on December 1st but what
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair might want to consider
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
is asking all of the employer
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives on this commission and
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
um labor Representatives on this
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
commission to form a subcommittee
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
mutual um consensus that would fit
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
within those terms of a shared
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility by employers and
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
employees it it would be something over
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
and above um Mr martine's in my view of
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
what would be appropriate what employees
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
already pay and employers would have to
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
absorb some additional cost but it would
 
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
it would have to be seen as a shared
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
benefit and I think that could be a I
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
can't remember if this commission
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
dissolves or not maybe somebody else
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
knows but there's no reason why even if
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
the commission dissolves that the folks
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
that are sitting at this
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
table management and labor so to speak
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
can't try to negotiate that and come
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
back to us in the legislature if there
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
is something that's a win-win for
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
everybody and then we could consider it
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
and it could be a late filing and once a
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
late Bill comes in GRS can analyze it
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
for cost that we have you know more data
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
to go on than you know just is a cola
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
good is a cola expensive is a cola
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
worthwhile we can go on and on and on
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
with that debate it's going to take him
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
employers and employees in my view to
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
agree to
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
something thank you Senator that's
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely true but there
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
are what 200 300 Employers in the
 
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.030 align:start position:0%
are what 200 300 Employers in the
retirement

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
system the only one we have direct
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
employees you and I as members of the
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislature give put the limit on what
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
can be negotiated with the the state
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
employees uh we have no very little
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
control over what the teachers negotiate
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
withu 53 for example it's it's we don't
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
have much control over that or what the
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
the point I'm trying to make is if
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
there's consensus and maybe there won't
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
be maybe this is an exercise in futility
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know but until you try um if
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's a consensus among the various um
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
management entities and obviously the
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
state has to be part of that but also
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
the entities representing all of the
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
labor groups then then it becomes
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
something that could come in front of us
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
could have a a real analysis for the
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
cost and
 
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.150 align:start position:0%
cost and
then

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
decide whether to move forward with it
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
but I also realize that it's November 3D
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
and if we're trying to have a report
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
which we need to have by December 1st
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's difficult but there's no reason
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
that those discussions can't continue to
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
true um Mr
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker I think the um Senate President
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I could make this commission
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
continue if we wish to and um I uh am
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable voting on anything today
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
that has to do with something we don't
 
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
have figures on we don't know how it's
 
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
going to work and we don't know how it's
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to affect everything so I think if
 
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
that discussion wants to continue that
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
it would be prudent to do so but not
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances where are today
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
let's fix this problem that we started
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
out with and then let's continue the
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
discussion on the uh um you know the
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
colas or whatever else that they needs
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
to be discussed but let's let's fix what
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
first well Senator gr that sounds like
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
you and I are the only ones in favor of
 
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.270 align:start position:0%
you and I are the only ones in favor of
your

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
proposal Madam chair certainly the
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
proposal that I made uh would not
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
exclude any Cola thing that you were
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
doing um it would be an added way that
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
that uh departments when they
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
negotiating with their unions could do
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
this um would not have any long-term
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
effects on on
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
colas U certainly I know that when I
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
retired at least once you know they came
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
to me and told me how I could split my
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
money up and you know buy annuities and
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
not buy annuities Etc uh this would uh
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the proposal that that I made would uh
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh let them have a pot of moneyy should
 
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
they choose to make those
 
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
contributions uh that they could use and
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
manage that money um any way they choose
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh chose to do it U so uh I I would like
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
to see an up or down vote on it and fine
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
and and okay then at least I can tell
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
them I tried okay so there's a a motion
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
that the commission
 
00:48:50.599 --> 00:48:52.510 align:start position:0%
that the commission
recommend

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
that all employees and employers
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
fund a
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
negotiated way for to provide cost to
 
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.430 align:start position:0%
negotiated way for to provide cost to
living

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
increases and that we submit legislation
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
to allow that to happen with the state
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
as the employe correct there a point of
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
inquiry yes would that be through the
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system the
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
not it would have to be negotiated one
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
way or the other but it would be between
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
each employer and each employee
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
group Senator question Madam chair I'm
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand so are you
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
saying this would be a mandatory subject
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
of bargaining I mean I I I don't know
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
that the proposal I don't know that I
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
personally feel comfortable enough to
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
vote on The Proposal
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
without more precise language before us
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
because I I think we could be going a
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
field of what is I think good intent but
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
just the way that it was explained to me
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
is that there would have to be enabling
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow for state
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
employees so you know when the when the
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
drafting happened and it'll get a full
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
hearing of both the the the Senate and
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
the house you know should it actually be
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
reduced to a bill and uh some of those
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
details I think Senator would be be
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
worked out at that time Senator the
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
problem is that the recommendation would
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
apply to all government employees in the
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
state and the legislation would only
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
apply to those actually employed by the
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
state government so the recommendation
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
each municipality or School District or
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
whatever would negotiate with its
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
employees to find a way to fund a cost
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
of living increase and that we would
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
have enabling legislation so that the
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
state employees could do the
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
same um I wouldn't put cost of L into it
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
I would call it an employee match which
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
which is what it is and it's called you
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
know in other and that
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know that again what I was told
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
is that we needed enabling legislation
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
that says you know
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
so Mr
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
R thank you madam chair I would ask that
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
if our plan is to come back on the
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
9th um I would request that we have this
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
proposal reduced to writing like we've
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
been required to do for previous
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
