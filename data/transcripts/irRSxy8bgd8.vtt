Manchester and I'm an insurance agent by
 
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
trade but I've been involved with
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
condominiums for the last 30 years of my
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
life having owned some as well as being
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
on the boards of some
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the the this I want to give
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
some background of what this bill is
 
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.430 align:start position:0%
some background of what this bill is
about

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
the last time we went through a
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
recession we had a number of
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
um condominium associations where they
 
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
had units that were foreclosed
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
and the banks were not doing anything
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
about it the financial institutions
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
would not foreclose
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
and uh the there were no payments for
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
condo fees being paid by those units
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
um often more often than not the
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
association would have to keep those
 
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
units heated because you have especially
 
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
in townhouses or what have you you have
 
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 align:start position:0%
utilities that go through all of them so
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
you can't just you know shut off the
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
heat in one and there was actually a
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
term coined I think by the Wall Street
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
Journal called Zombie mortgages
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay where the um the banks wouldn't do
 
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
anything about them and you all know if
 
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 align:start position:0%
you've ever
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
had a mortgage you signed 20 pages and
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
on each page it tells you all the
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
terrible things they can do if you're
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
late by a day or all these other things
 
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 align:start position:0%
that go on
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
yet when it came down to a situation
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
um where a unit was for some reason
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
abandoned uh the people had either lost
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
their job or divorce or medical issues
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
and they were no longer in the units
 
00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.890 align:start position:0%
and they were no longer in the units
the

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
financial institutions would not
 
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.950 align:start position:0%
financial institutions would not
foreclose

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
foreclose
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
and that harms the rest of the
 
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.370 align:start position:0%
and that harms the rest of the
association

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
we did have a a sister type of Bill that
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
was passed by this Committee in the
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
house a number of years ago which
 
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
allowed condominium associations to at
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
least put a uh a lien on a unit for up
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
to six months of condo fees because what
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
would happen is if the unit was vacant
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
it was abandoned
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
um the finance of the financial
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
institution would not pay the condo fees
 
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
and as soon as they foreclosed it wiped
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
it away
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
and the associations would be out
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
these fees
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
actually we came to terms with the uh
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
the folks at the banking Commission
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
because they realized
 
00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:26.210 align:start position:0%
because they realized
um

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
that a healthy Association is good for
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
every lender for every unit so if you
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
have one or two bad apples it's not good
 
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
for the whole
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
and they did agree to that lean and that
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
has been a place for the last three
 
00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:40.099 align:start position:0%
years and I don't think there's been a
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
uh a hint of any kind of an issue with
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
that since we put it in place
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of The Next Step what do
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
you do when a financial institution will
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
not foreclose on a property the condo
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
association continues to pay
 
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
and that you know
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's kind of taking from the rest when
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
they're not doing
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh fulfilling their obligation now
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'm also a nice guy and I don't want
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
people kicked out of their Condominiums
 
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
people kicked out of their Condominiums
either

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
people fall in hard times sometimes it's
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
very short period of time
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
so while this bill does not have
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
it what I'm going to propose in it at
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
this point if you look on line three of
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.890 align:start position:0%
the bill
356

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
356
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 11.
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
any suit to enforce any lean preferred
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
under paragraph three
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
I would add for a condominium abandoned
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
by the owners I don't want to force this
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
issue for people that are just trying to
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
maybe had a short-term situation and are
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get their way out of it this
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
is for people that have said look I'm
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
sorry for some reason any reason in
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
their life that they can no longer
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
afford this and they are leaving they
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
are taking their stuff they're going and
 
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're abandoning their unit
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
I would like to make it that narrow
 
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.269 align:start position:0%
I would like to make it that narrow
because

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
one of the things and we've brought this
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
bill up in previous years
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
people have talked about is well you
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
know you get some people that are behind
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
by three or four months and you get some
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
people on a really really
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable board and they're just
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
gonna start that foreclosure process on
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
these people because they're angry with
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
maybe something else that they did maybe
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
their dog barks too much or something
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
like that I don't want this to have
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
this is where people have decided that
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
they can no longer
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh stay there they cannot afford it I do
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
know this goes on I have a friend of
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
mine passed away in a car accident four
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
years ago and I took on his estate
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
as an executor and he had had some
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
issues and he had not paid his mortgage
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
for four years
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
it took me a court order from the
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Probate Court to get
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
the bank to take the house back so I
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
could get on with the estate
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
they just wouldn't do it
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
someone someone
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
finally a law firm in New York they're
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually angry with me when they talked
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the telephone how dare I do that like
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
well due respect I'm trying to close
 
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
this estate he hasn't paid in five years
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
would you please
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
take it back
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately this does happen and
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
this was three or four years ago when
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
the economy was fine
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
um I understand financial institutions
 
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't want to put this on
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
their reports because every time you
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
have a loan if you know anything about
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
Bank reports that have to be done by the
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
feds every quarter you have to list how
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
many of your loans are 30 you know 60 90
 
00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:27.779 align:start position:0%
days late and how many are you going to
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
write off and and I understand in a bad
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
time they don't want to inundate their
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
that report to the to the feds uh well
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I get that but you're not
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
helping the entire situa the entire
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
condominium and I know my friends at the
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
the bank banking Lobby are going to be
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
against me in there I call them my
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
friends because we usually get along on
 
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
everything we usually agree on most
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
things this one
 
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree on because I do
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
believe if you have one or two units
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
that are not paying their fair share the
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
financial institutions are also not
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
paying that fair share they're kind of
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
taking away and making the other unit
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
owners have to pay for that expense and
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's right that's what
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put it into
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
sorry to bring such a
 
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.650 align:start position:0%
sorry to bring such a
riveting

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
riveting
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
um issue to you at 10 A.M but Mr
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
chairman that is my testimony
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay so um just for a little edification
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
for the committee members this has been
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
an issue over many of my many of my
 
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.750 align:start position:0%
an issue over many of my many of my
years

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
of having condo bills come to this
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee and the resolution was really
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
driven by Fannie Mae
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
who just who decided that six months was
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
the right number and so we thought that
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
was great and we passed that legislation
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
and it's been on the books for
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
no fair amount of years yeah
 
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.090 align:start position:0%
no fair amount of years yeah
so

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
what's different I mean Fannie Mae
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed their mind so why why
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
would we want to revisit this issue this
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
is not revisioning that issue Mr
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
chairman that issue had to do with
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
condominium fees that were not paid and
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
it allowed the association to put a lien
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
for six months worth of condominium fees
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the event of a bankruptcy or
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
foreclosure by the financial institution
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
the lien would still be there uh and and
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
the association would be able to
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
retrieve some of their money we also
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
found out that once a lien was placed
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
usually the institution
 
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.730 align:start position:0%
usually the institution
um

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say woke up but you got
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
an idea what was going on and they
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
usually tried to address it and more
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
often than not they paid those six
 
00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:30.710 align:start position:0%
often than not they paid those six
months

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
um to get that lien off this is this is
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
totally different this has to do with
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
when a unit is vacant it has been
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
abandoned by the unit owner and the bank
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
will not foreclose on it and put it back
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
out for sale it allows the association
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
to do that when the institution will not
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
not that I want to you know debate
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
semantics but this was an issue of super
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
lean that that you were you would that
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
the Foreclosure responsibilities the
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
bank's foreclosure and you are now who
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
technically you're lean on fees is a
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
second the condo association's sick and
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
and so you're you are asking to have to
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
jump over the bank and to force that
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
foreclosure when you're technically the
 
00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
fees are only a second
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
uh lean rather than the first lean which
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm pausing only because I want to make
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
sure I don't say the wrong thing and I
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
believe what you're saying is correct
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
but um there will be a an attorney
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
speaking after me that may be able to
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
better answer that question for you Mr
 
00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
better answer that question for you Mr
chairman

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.569 align:start position:0%
chairman
okay

00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
any other questions the committee
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
I have
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
rather extensive experience with this
 
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.069 align:start position:0%
rather extensive experience with this
problem

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
I in the REO world real estate owned uh
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
so this is not this is a wood you
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
believe are you asking a question this
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
is the this is the I think this is uh
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
the the question that I have for the
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
petitioner is this
 
00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.590 align:start position:0%
petitioner is this
uh

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding that the intent
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
is to prevent a situation where a bank
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
may or may not have chosen to foreclose
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
on a defaulted mortgage where the
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
property has been abandoned for some
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
period of time from three months to
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
and to not allow those homeowners
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
association dues to accumulate unpaid
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
yes and no the first part of your
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
statement yes is to allow the condo
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
association to bring a foreclosure
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but not necessarily for that three
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
months to not I think it was a year but
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
um over a year haven't been paid
 
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.769 align:start position:0%
um over a year haven't been paid
um

00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
their fees but it's not necessarily to
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
collect the fees that's where there's a
 
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
difference here the first one was to be
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
able to collect the fees the bill that
 
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
was passed four or five years ago this
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
is to take an abandoned property into
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
force a foreclosure when the financial
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
institution won't so it can then be
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
brought put back on the market and and
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
be sold so the next person can own it
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
and pay their condo fees is this is to
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
do it when the bank refuses to do
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh to to initiate the Foreclosure so the
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
the further question may inquire I'm
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
sorry uh further so the your this this
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
allows the association to do a
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
foreclosure is that what we're correct
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
got it and there's a lot of notice in
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
here and and that
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
um there is a law in the Commonwealth of
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and some other states so
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
this is not a novel idea that we're just
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
trying to bring to to New Hampshire to
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
see if it works
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Burroughs
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering if
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about the about the what
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
the definition of Abandonment is and
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
obviously if somebody has cleared out
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
all their stuff that's a strong
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
indicator but I'm wondering you know are
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
there is it is there a set criteria for
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
this I'm thinking maybe somebody who's
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
gone off in military duties somebody's
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
gone off to take care of a elderly
 
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
parent maybe gone for months or they're
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
sick themselves so what protections do
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
the language I proposed does not define
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
abandoned if if this is something the
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee is willing to move forward or
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
with the codicil that it would be only
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
for abandoned properties I would add a
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
definition of that
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Gibbons
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I need a clarification and then I'm
 
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
going to have to ask for a further
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
inquiry as well uh first of all for
 
00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.490 align:start position:0%
inquiry as well uh first of all for
clarification

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
um we are discussing HB 178 and the
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
reason that I ask is because the one
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
that I read over the weekend and
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
actually did some research on uh says
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
nothing about abandonment
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
um so this is HB 178 and if so could you
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
tell us again the exact language about
 
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment abandonment that you would add
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
and and where where you would edit yes
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
it would be line three of the bill
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
starts off Roman numeral 11.
 
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.289 align:start position:0%
starts off Roman numeral 11.
a

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
any suit to enforce any lean perfected
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
under paragraph three
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
or a condominium abandoned by the owners
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
shall be and that's where it would
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
def that was where it would segregate or
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
a condo abandoned by the owners okay
 
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.370 align:start position:0%
a condo abandoned by the owners okay
um

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh and then I I do have a further
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
question uh yes
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and here I'm just going to
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
um use some information that I'm
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
personally familiar with as an example
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
um on which I base my question
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
as I understand the bill and uh some
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
research I did over the weekend Uh
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
current legislation provides that a lien
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
for unpaid condo fees may only be for
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
six months of unpaid condo fees
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and I live in a condo in Concord uh
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
and so using my own information as an
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
example uh six months of condo fees is a
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
little over two thousand dollars
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time uh
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
the most recent sale of a unit in my
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
condo development was for more than two
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars so
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
this would appear to allow foreclosure
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
and sale of a two hundred thousand
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
dollar unit for two thousand dollars of
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
unpaid condo fees and
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
um how would you address that and make
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
sure that you were protecting for
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
instance individuals
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
um uh referenced in the earlier question
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
who might be a way because of military
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
duty or uh be long-term hospitalized and
 
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps have appeared to abandon their
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
unit but in fact not have intended to do
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
so but might be deprived of a two
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar unit
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
um for payment for lack of payment of
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
the protocol in the law does not allow
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
for the association to keep any of the
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
funds in excess of what they're owed
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
okay it would go back to the financial
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
institution the event of foreclosure so
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's not entitled to be a windfall where
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
hey we get two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
for a two thousand dollar
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
um condo fees that are owed that is not
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
um the way the whole process works
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
the comment you make about someone in
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
military service or someone away
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's a valid point
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
in an association pretty much everyone
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
knows what's going on going on with
 
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
someone and when someone the association
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
the board of directors usually knows
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of a situation where
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
um at least in Massachusetts where
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
this this is done
 
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.169 align:start position:0%
this this is done
um

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:32.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
very abruptly that people don't know
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on and and they know when
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
the unit is empty is people have moved
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
out it has been gone for a certain
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
period of time the association has had
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
to enter the associate the unit to keep
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
the heat on and is paying the utilities
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
under that is usually what happens and
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
that's when they know it's it's
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
abandoned and they would utilize this
 
00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
abandoned and they would utilize this
law

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
further inquiry further in question you
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
may inquire thank you uh
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
my question actually
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
um was not intended to address the
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
question of windfall I didn't I do
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
understand your point about that
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
um nevertheless uh and sure most of the
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
time the condo award will know what's
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
going on but
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
none of that is perfect
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
um in order to avoid someone absolutely
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
losing a two hundred thousand dollar
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
home regardless of the windfall question
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
um would you be open to adding a
 
00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:38.419 align:start position:0%
provision that would allow foreclosure
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
only when the uh unpaid condo fees were
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
either a certain dollar amount or a
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
minimum certain dollar amount or a
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
minimum percentage of the worth of the
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
unit in question
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
maybe the former but not the latter or
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's a certain percentage of the value I
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'd like to not further um answer that
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
question only because I am not a lawyer
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
by trade a lawyer will be testifying and
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
knows the whole protocol of what you
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
have to do the notifications that need
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
to be done they're certified letters all
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
the things the protocols that need to be
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
done with notifying the bank and
 
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
everything else to make sure that you're
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
not going to do some of the things which
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
you're you you are fearing that might
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
happen and I just don't want to muddy
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the water when I think a more coherent
 
00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:29.059 align:start position:0%
answer can come after me
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
excuse me one more further inquiry
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
we will be doing a subcommittee so
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
um very last one I promise okay thank
 
00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:40.310 align:start position:0%
um very last one I promise okay thank
you

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.330 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.669 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
and that that all makes sense
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
um but back to the question of the uh
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
person who's in the military or in
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
long-term hospitalization
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
um while the bank would certainly
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
receive the notice owners in those
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
circumstances might not receive the
 
00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:01.909 align:start position:0%
circumstances might not receive the
notice

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
so how how does that how does that
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
provision protect the owner
 
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry again I'm not trying to
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
deflect your questions I just know that
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
someone knows the law the current
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
protocols the checks and balance is much
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
better than I who can better answer that
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
question in a few minutes when I'm
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
finished testifying and I'm sure they
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
will because I'm sure they're taking
 
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.890 align:start position:0%
will because I'm sure they're taking
notes

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:27.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh make sure that person
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
has a pink card thank you okay
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon you mentioned that a
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
bank might not want to carry this on
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
their balance sheet so to speak is there
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
another reason that they might not want
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
to do a lien or a foreclosure right away
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that they didn't think that they
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
could resell the property right away but
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
so is there an option that the bank
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
could basically start paying for the
 
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:00.740 align:start position:0%
electricity the fuel the the condo fees
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
instead of foreclosing so they could
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
hold it off for a while but of course in
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
that case I would assume that they would
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think we would all rather that the
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
institution financial institutions step
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
up and pay the condo fees and pay their
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
utility bills and do that you are spot
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
on with your
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
um estimation of what occurred years ago
 
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.990 align:start position:0%
um estimation of what occurred years ago
the

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh appraised values of some of these
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
Condominiums fell below the uh amount of
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
the note
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
and they did not want to put it on the
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
market until the market recovered
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
I respect them wanting to do that from a
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
business decision but again it's all
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
fair in Love and War here that might be
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
a good decision for the bank but how
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
as I understand it one of the purposes
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to help the condo
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
association to recoup costs such as
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
heating costs after a unit is abandoned
 
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.169 align:start position:0%
heating costs after a unit is abandoned
because

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
the association needs to heat that unit
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
to keep the entire block heated
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
does the association also continue to
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
pay heating costs after a unit is
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
vacated after a voluntary vacate such as
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
when uh tenants move out
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know it all depends on the situation
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
um you know not every single Association
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
is built the same way that it has common
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
utilities the ones that would yes the
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
association would have to step in
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
because they don't want the power to go
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
off so they would do that but you have
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
to think of you have 100 units everyone
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
has 100 1 100th of the obligation to pay
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
for the Landscaping the plowing uh the
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
new roofs all the expenses associated
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
with that Association when one or two
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
percent those aren't doing it everyone
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
else has to
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
um pay the difference
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
um so that's what we're trying to stop
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
but direct answer your question it all
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
depends on how the association's built
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
and yes the association does have to
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
take especially for insurance purposes
 
00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
whatever means necessary to keep it
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
heated so you don't have frozen pipes
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
and cause
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you all
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%

attention when you introduced yourself

to me the first one
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%

about 38 represents 38 member banks that
 
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
employ nearly 6 000 employees we come
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
before the committee today to provide
 
00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:05.539 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to House Bill
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
178 relative to the enforcement of
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
condominium liens for assessments as
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
introduced HP 178 would increase
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
condominium associations current
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer condominium boards the right
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
to foreclose upon and evict
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
um condominium unit owners for unpaid
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
assessments and that says currently
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
written regardless of the amount that's
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
owed this proposal goes well beyond the
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
2010 compromise that created existing
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
statutory priority lien rights for
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
unpaid assessment fees and allowed
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
condominium associations to require unit
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
orders that to Escrow up to six months
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
of fees if they so choose for committee
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
members who are returning this all may
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
sound familiar in 2021 a nearly
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
identical bill was introduced House Bill
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
426 this committee unanimously
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
recommended an expedient to legislate
 
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
with an 18-0 vote and then again in 2019
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
a nearly identical proposal was brought
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
before the committee HP 436 it also
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
failed to get your endorsement and was
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommended in expedient to legislate
 
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
with 19 nothing vote
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
again condominium associations already
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
have less drastic options at their
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
disposal neither of which would require
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
such a significant policy change as
 
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
already mentioned associations can
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
require unit owners to Escrow up to six
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
months of assessment fees providing a
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
cushion when delinquencies arise
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
additionally they can limit access to
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
common areas such as Jim's pools parking
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
uh to encourage unit owners to pay their
 
00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
fair share
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
if enacted hb1 178 is likely to have
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
significant unintended consequences and
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on the condominium
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
Market specifically if a condominium
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
board can foreclose upon a unit it will
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
increase the lenders are members risk

Lending
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
this could also result in borrows paying
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
higher interest rates in an already high
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
interest rate environment to account for
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
the added risk or limit access to
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
lending more generally such consequences
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
are likely to have impact that extend
 
00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:18.419 align:start position:0%
beyond the banking industry and could
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
make Condominiums a less attractive
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
option for first-time home buyers which
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
may reduce the values of Condominiums
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
and could impair an already anemic
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
housing market by taking options off the

table
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's essential there's also a
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
substantial question uh as to whether
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
this Bill runs a foul of Fannie Mae's
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements since 2014
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
Fannie Mae only requires a priority lien
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
for six months of unpaid assessment fees
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
under this proposal and others like it
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
the lien holders would be entitled to
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
legal fees costs and expenses
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
why would this impact Banks many sell
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
their mortgages to the secondary Market
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining the servicing
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
rights Fannie Mae is what an entity is
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
one of the entities Banks use in the
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
secondary Market adding these fees to
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
the lien would likely prevent this from
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
occurring making Condominiums mortgages
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
riskier for banks to take on possibly
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
adding to the chilling effect this bill
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
will have on the market
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to just address a couple
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised to the prior
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Gibbs you made a
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually a great point in the fact that
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
a Condominium Association this would
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
allow them to foreclose on uh initiate
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the foreclosure for a few thousand
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
dollars as opposed to the bank's risk
 
00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
that could be 200 000 in in your in your
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
association's case
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
um if not higher
 
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.850 align:start position:0%
um if not higher
um

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh also as far as the maintenance of the
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the abandoned property uh Fannie Mae
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
does have a property maintenance Matrix
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the um if a bank has identified a
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
facility as being abandoned a mortgaged
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
property as being abandoned or vacant
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
um so there's certain things they do
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
they have to do
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to provide that Matrix uh
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
to you all if you'd like uh so in
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
closing and before I hand it over to Rob
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
Dieu who would like to share a few
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts of his own in closing I would
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
respectively ask the committee to vote
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
down HP 178 and recommend inexpedient to
 
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
legislate as the committee has done in
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
the past with similar bills uh thank you
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
for your consideration and I'll hand it
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
over to Rob
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members I'm Rob
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
dietel I'm with the Gallagher
 
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
callahanagar Trail firm here in Concord
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm counseled to the bankers
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
Association as Ryan said this is an
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
issue that's been bubbling up
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
um off and on for years a great and
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
workable compromise was reached in 2010
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
and I thought I'd share some perspective
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
there was a case back in 2016 that went
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
up to the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
which I had the privilege of
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
representing the bankers Association in
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it's called New Hampshire Housing
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority versus Pinewood or uh
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah Pinewood Condominium Association
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
what happened in that case was the
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association sought to impose
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
lien rights against actually the New
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority's
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
interest this isn't always in the
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
context of banks it can impact anybody
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
that holds a mortgage
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
and the Superior Court read our
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
Condominium Act thought that priority
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
rights could be obtained
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
Authority appealed and we joined in that
 
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.330 align:start position:0%
Authority appealed and we joined in that
appeal

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court looked
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
at our Condominium Act looked at the
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
compromise that was put in place in 2010
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
and found that the six-month priority
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
lien that exists under state law
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
represented a very careful balancing
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to ensure that there's
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
access to credit for individuals who
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
want to buy condominiums in the state of
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I want a flag at the
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
end of their decision and they don't
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
always do this they included sort of a
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
discussion about the policy reasons here
 
00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:05.659 align:start position:0%
and Justice Bassett wrote
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
are holding today advances the policies
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
underlying the Condominium Act to rule
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise meaning to allow more than six
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
months priority would create uncertainty
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
for lenders that provide mortgage
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
financing to condominium owners the
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
ability of condominium owners to readily
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
secure mortgage financing is crucial to
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
the viability of the condominium form of
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
ownership improving access to mortgages
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
for Condominiums allows those who cannot
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
afford a single-family dwelling to
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
realize the American dream of home
 
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.570 align:start position:0%
realize the American dream of home
ownership

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:37.580 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
this policy principle that they outline
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
is not um hyperbolic in any way the
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
standards that Ryan mentioned from
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
Fannie Mae really come into play here
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
because when a bank originates a
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage loan
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
they're frequently doing so with the
 
00:33:54.889 --> 00:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
understanding that they're going to pass
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
that debt on to a secondary purchaser of
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
that mortgage and if Fannie Mae is not
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
standing behind that then that mortgage
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
is not going to get sold on the
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
secondary market and as a consequence
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's a trickle-down effect then the
 
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
bank won't be in the business of issuing
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
condominium loans
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's a real real world problem with
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
that that has a meaningful impact and
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative gibbs's comment about the
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
the disparity between the amount that
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
might be owed and the amount owed on the
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
mortgage is an important one to really
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
highlight because it's actually worse
 
00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:32.899 align:start position:0%
than what representative Gibbs said
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
under this bill it provides and this is
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
at line 17. the reasonable legal fees
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
and costs incurred by the unit Owners
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
Association shall be included as part of
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
the lien and part of the priority lien
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
so if we pull back and think about
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
practically speaking what could happen
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
here you could have a condominium board
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's frustrated with a unit owner
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
wants to get them out wants to foreclose
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
is owed a couple thousand dollars and
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
goes into court hires an attorney and
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
the attorney says to the board there's
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
no skin off your back I'm going to be
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
able to collect my attorney's fees
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
against the mortgage
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
and then they go into court and they
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
potentially foreclose for two thousand
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
dollars maybe rack up tens of thousands
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
in legal fees and then all of that comes
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
out from a priority position against the
 
00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.270 align:start position:0%
out from a priority position against the
bank

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
bank
 
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
that is a real problem and there's no
 
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
checks and balances right now in this in
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
this bill as drafted to prevent that
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
type of scenario from occurring so I
 
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
hope that information is helpful if
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'm happy to take
 
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.310 align:start position:0%
there's any questions I'm happy to take
them

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not a banker and I'm not a lawyer
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
so I may not see the nuances of
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
something but if we did change the words
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
the way the sponsor indicated and said
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
this can only happen in the case of an
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
abandonment we're not talking about
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
for closing for two thousand dollars in
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
fees we're talking about a condo that's
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
been abandoned and the association now
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
says all right we've carried this long
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
enough and a definition of what long
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
enough an abandonment is needs to be
 
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.490 align:start position:0%
enough an abandonment is needs to be
defined

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
does that ease up any of this
 
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.510 align:start position:0%
does that ease up any of this
potentially

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and I say potentially because the the
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
devil's in the details right
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so we have to there'd have to be
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful safeguards in place to make
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
sure that the proper parties are being
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
noticed there'd have to be evaluation
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
from my perspective on the timelines and
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
the amounts that would trigger this sort
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
of event to occur but there would also
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
have to be thought given to this
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
priority position
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the language that's in there because
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
it it encourages the tail wagging the
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
dog so to speak right
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
um and so long as the condo association
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
can get priority of both more than six
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
months attorneys fees all of that you're
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
gonna be stuck with the same problem
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
that the secondary Market might not
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
accept these loans
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
and beyond that you may have a scenario
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
where a small amount throws them to a
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
large amount through attorneys fees and
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
really creates an inequitable balance so
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's doable but there's a lot along the
 
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
it's doable but there's a lot along the
way

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you gentlemen
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
with respect to the issue of
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
the condo association not being happy
 
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:51.380 align:start position:0%
because it's not receiving its fees
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
would a situation exist such that
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
the lender would not be receiving or
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
would be receiving payments at that time
 
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.069 align:start position:0%
would be receiving payments at that time
um

00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
such that the lender would be
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
disinclined to move to foreclose because
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
the lender was actually receiving shall
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
we say mortgage payments
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and in general what are the factors
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
that would lead you to foreclose or not
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
foreclose in addition to the
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
illustration which has already been
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
cited where a condo unit may actually be
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
appraised at a value less than the
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
original mortgage amount I hope that
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
those two questions are distinct enough
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
so you can answer both of them yeah I
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
think you can well
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
for there could be a variety of reasons
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
why the bank's not foreclosing I think
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
one uh would be that they're trying to
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
work something out with the home buyer
 
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know maybe providing some loan
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
modification to to get them through uh
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the last thing a bank wants to do is
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
foreclose it's really the last tool in
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
the toolbox
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
um because again there's a lot at stake
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
here it's a it's a high risk they don't
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
um they want to keep that individual in
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
their home I think we saw that through
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
the covet pandemic and all the
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
forbearance programs that were going on
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
to really make sure that homeowner again
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
a lot that was required but Banks were
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
doing that prior it's what they do they
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the mortgagee is
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
um is being is in their home and trying
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
to work through it
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
um Rob I don't know if you have anything
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
else you'd like to add so I with respect
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
to the first question please yeah I
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair summary Ryan there's
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's as Ryan said there's a lot of
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
reasons why a bank might not be
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
foreclosing one of the principal reasons
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
might be that they may not even be aware
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
that there are delinquencies outstanding
 
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099 align:start position:0%
in the condominium assessments
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and and this is this goes back to the
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
policy issues we were talking about
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
before part of the reason why
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
six months priority lien rights were
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
created to give condominium associations
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
that right is it reflects an
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
understanding that condominium boards
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
are in the best position to understand
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem with a unit owner
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
if they're becoming delinquent
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
um banks are not always going to be
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on boots on the
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
ground at the Condominium Association
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and that dovetails into it's not just
 
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
a priority lean right that was created
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
as Ryan mentioned in his remarks there's
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
a right to Escrow Condominium
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
Association dues so these things are
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
intended to work in concert with each
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
other so if you're a board and you've
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
got an individual who you're foreseeing
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
a problem you can go to them and say
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
look we've had some issues with your
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
payments we want you to Escrow six
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
months worth of condominium assessments
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
but what's happened and this is just a
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
practical observation so I'm a
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
practicing lawyer I'm often defending
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
individuals and companies in court I've
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
had condo associations call me up and
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
they'll say we've got a delinquent owner
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
what do we do and I'll ask them well did
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
you put in place the six-month priority
 
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
lien and almost always the answer is no
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
and it's not because that lean right
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
isn't working it's because of the
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
realities of a Condominium Association
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
you have volunteer boards and you have
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
most condo associations are small
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're not 100 units they're 20 or 10
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
units and you know the people personally
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
and individually and I think there's a
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
human nature aspect of perhaps not
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
wanting to be aggressive and going after
 
00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:27.230 align:start position:0%
wanting to be aggressive and going after
them

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
but those are decisions that are being
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
made by the condo association that the
 
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
bank can't control or be a part of in
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
any meaningful way so I hope that's
 
00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:37.609 align:start position:0%
any meaningful way so I hope that's
helpful

00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
further question oh thank you so so in
 
00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:45.500 align:start position:0%
fact there may be there are situations
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
where condo owners are making their
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
mortgage payments but not making their
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
paying their condo fees
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
which is what I think I heard when you
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
said we're not even aware of there being
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
a problem and I infer from that that
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you're the bank is
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
being paid
 
00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:09.619 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that at the same time
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
the condo owner is not paying his or her
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
condo fees is yes or no
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
in some scenarios yes in some scenarios
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
no and what's more nuanced than that is
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that sometimes these disputes the reason
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
why they're not being paid is not a
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
financial reason sometimes it's we don't
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
think that that contract with the guy
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
who mows the lawn was a good contract
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
and the board is mismanaging it there's
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of personality in human nature
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
that comes into these thank you missions
 
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.589 align:start position:0%
that comes into these thank you missions
representative

00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
um my my question to the previous uh
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
speaker was whether the bank can uh or
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
will pay uh you know the electric bill
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
the fuel Bill and whatever and uh you
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh Fannie Mae Matrix so is
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
it do I understand that that's required
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
in order to sell that mortgage into the
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
secondary Market could you explain a
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
little bit further
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
so general what happens is when the bank
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
makes the mortgage
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and they sell it off to the secondary
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
Market they still own the servicing
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll maintain the servicing
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
rates so they they bill they they bill
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and when the bank under the agreement
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
with Fannie Mae as a servicer when
 
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
they've identified that the property is
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
vacant and abandoned
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
um there they have this obligation to
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
maintain this property through this
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
property maintenance guide
 
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much oh
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
Jeff representative Sullivan
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
um so yeah one of the things that you've
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned is the potential for a
 
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
trickle-down chilling effect on the
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
condo Market I'm curious since there are
 
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
other states that have similar types of
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
laws if we see any evidence of that
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually happening seems like a perfect
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
natural experiment between Massachusetts
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
and here to see if there's a big Delta
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
between single-family homes and condos
 
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.410 align:start position:0%
between single-family homes and condos
in

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that doesn't exist in New
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of a regulation
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
well what I would say in Ryan certainly
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
step in if you have more timely
 
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
information than I do is unfortunately I
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
don't know the specific answer that
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
question and I'm not sure it actually is
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
answerable and the reason why I say that
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
is because these condo acts are fitting
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
within the Matrix of whatever the laws
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
are in place so for instance New
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire foreclosures are generally not
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
judicial foreclosures their power of
 
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
sale foreclosures another jurisdiction
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
might have a Judicial foreclosure system
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
they might have different mechanisms
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
that enable condo associations to be
 
00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:49.700 align:start position:0%
more proactive or not
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so and and beyond that Fannie Mae
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
has standards that are time based so if
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
laws were enacted prior to 2014
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
Fannie Mae will recognize those if
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
they're enacted after 2014 they do not
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
that goes down to reasons of notice and
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
takings and things along those lines but
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to compare apples to
 
00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah my memory was when we did this bill
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
12 years ago maybe I'm going to ask Tara
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
Reardon and she remember so I remember
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
we did get a piece of paper that said
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts rate interest rates
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
were three quarters higher
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
I remember never getting it back down
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I do have testimony that written
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that I'll hand out good
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
that'll make the clerk happy
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
do I need to hit this button yes of
 
00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:02.030 align:start position:0%
do I need to hit this button yes of
course

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
red is good thank you red means stop I
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
thought um
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Eric Shaughnessy
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney I represent condo
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
associations in New Hampshire and in
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I'm speaking in
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I'm also a member
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
of Community Association Institute of
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
New England Cai there's another member
 
00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:23.099 align:start position:0%
from that group that will be speaking so
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to address I'm going to leave
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
some things to him and I'm addressing
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
some things from uh from what I've heard
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
and I want to start by actually doing a
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
little comparison because there were
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
some questions asked about other states
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
and how they operate
 
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.089 align:start position:0%
and how they operate
and

00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to highlight it's our
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
neighbor Massachusetts
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
they have a priority lien that can be
 
00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
any number of months not six not 12 not
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
18 it can Theory be any number of months
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
and they have the ability to foreclose
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
and we see no chilling effect on sales
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
of condo units throughout the state
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
so from a practitioner's standpoint we
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
see no problem in terms of units being
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
sold all the time and the fact that
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts can have 6 12 18 months of
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
priority lien has not stopped
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh the secondary Market from happening
 
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.390 align:start position:0%
uh the secondary Market from happening
and

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
the representatives from the on the
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
banking side you'd like to use terms
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
such as likely and maybe very
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
non-definitive terms
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
to suggest that there could be in theory
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
a possible issue I just want to
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
highlight that we see as from a
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
practitioner standpoint actual problems
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
Within These communities where you have
 
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:40.220 align:start position:0%
unit owners who for whatever reason
 
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
choose not to issue payment of the condo
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
fees which then places the financial
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
burden on the remainder of the community
 
00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
to carry that
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
and to carry it for an extended period
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
that is inherently unfair to the rest of
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
the community this bill is simply
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
seeking to create a uniform mechanism to
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
solve that problem it does not create
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
more than six months worth of priority
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
lien it's still six months if there's a
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
priority lien you have the right to
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
foreclose if there's no priority you
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
still have the right to foreclose but it
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't go from six months to 18 months
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
or from 6 to 12 it stays at six that
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
number doesn't change throughout the
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
course of this process
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the safeguards that were
 
00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:25.010 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the safeguards that were
mentioned

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
talked about in the form of notices
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
for a practitioner such as myself to go
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
to to get this priority in theory to
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
foreclose we have to send notice to the
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
owner we have to send multiple notices
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
to the mortgage company we have to file
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit we have to serve that lawsuit
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
on the unit owner and the mortgage
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
company we'd have to file all our
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork at the court serve that
 
00:48:49.329 --> 00:48:49.339 align:start position:0%
paperwork including motions for judgment
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
on all the parties then hold a hearing
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
where the other side the bank the unit
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
owner has the opportunity to be heard in
 
00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
court and then the court the judge will
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to rule on the issue and Grant
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
judgment and allow the association to
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
move forward so this isn't as if we send
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
one piece of paper out the door and all
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
of a sudden we can go foreclose there's
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
an extended long process to get to the
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
end point wherein many of these
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
safeguards mentioned are hit repeated
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
notices throughout the entirety of the
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
process is when the when the bankers say
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
well we don't know what's happening we
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
let them know multiple times and giving
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
them multiple opportunities to address
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
the issue which they have the right to
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
do and they have to make a decision
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
either to address it or not to address
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
it it's not a lack of notice or lack of
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
being informed it's an internal decision
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
whether they address it and respond
 
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.309 align:start position:0%
whether they address it and respond
so

00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take some
 
00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions that may exist but that is the
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
process it is it is not overnight it is
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
long it is slow
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
and this bill seeks to create a formal a
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
unified process to address really those
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so I I'll ask a similar question I
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
asked them you could because you
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned it you seem to think that
 
00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:08.339 align:start position:0%
there is no chilling effect in the
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
secondary Market in Massachusetts are
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
you saying that because people are able
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
to do it are you saying that there is no
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
spread between maybe what's happening in
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in here or what's
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
happening in single family versus here
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
what I can say is from my perspective on
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
what I see I see no issue no problem in
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh mortgages being assigned because we
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
look in the registry of deeds we follow
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
the title to the property when we do
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
this we see it all assigned all the time
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
we deal with Services all the time I
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
don't from my perspective from what I
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
see I do not see and I'm not a blender
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak on their behalf but I
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
do not see anything that indicates that
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
there's an inability
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
follow up for the question you may
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
inquire um okay but be clear you're not
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
sure if there is a a larger spread in
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
the condo to single-family Market in say
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which has this law versus
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
um or if you were to compare those two
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
spreads in the two states like there's
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
ways to get at this I'm just wondering
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
if you know that I personally do not
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
know that and I cannot say definitively
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert did you have a
 
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.150 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert did you have a
question

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
I think you might have just answered the
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
question I wanted you represent mass and
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
also New Hampshire is there any any uh
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
distinction or difference in the system
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that uh uh informs you
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh when you because you were talking
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
about Massachusetts most of the time I'm
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
talking about both States so
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
right now in Massachusetts so we
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
to effectuate a priority lien we have to
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
send a series of notices to the unit
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
owner and to the mortgage company and in
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
that sense it's exactly the same as New
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those processes are pretty
 
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.410 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those processes are pretty
identical

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
identical
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
from that point in Massachusetts we
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit we serve it on the
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
parties and we seek judgment we go to
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
court the court grants the Judgment
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
possibly and from there we're allowed to
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
foreclose and in Massachusetts we're
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
allowed to add more than six months New
 
00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
we send those same notices we then
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
record what's called a membrane of a
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
lien and then we can file the lawsuit
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
and from there we can go to court get a
 
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.809 align:start position:0%
and from there we can go to court get a
judgment

00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
and then from that we can exercise a
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
Sheriff sale or some other mechanism to
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
try to get to the end goal which is a
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
more prolonged process
 
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.750 align:start position:0%
more prolonged process
so

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I guess to answer your question I'm
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
not just talking about Massachusetts the
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
states that have a big distinction in it
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's a huge separation at the point
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
following the notices being sent
 
00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:46.460 align:start position:0%
I guess my question
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
I so my question is essentially
 
00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:53.339 align:start position:0%
is there a problem
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
in your opinion between what New
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has now or if they put a
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
six-month limit is there a problem or an
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
issue there that uh would tell me as a
 
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.630 align:start position:0%
issue there that uh would tell me as a
legislator

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
this is not a good idea what something
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
else should be done because
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a multiple
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out whether we
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
should be doing anything and I want your
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
opinion sure yes my opinion is there is
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
a problem there's an inability for these
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
communities to resolve Perpetual
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
non-payment historical non-payers that
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
that you'll have literally years of
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
condo fees owed because there's no good
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
solution in the pocket for the
 
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
association the idea of getting six
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
months paid up front doesn't make sense
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
when the owner is not going to pay
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
already we can't say please pay us six
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
more months if they're not going to pay
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
us the existing six months so there
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
there is a problem that this bill seeks
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
to solve which is addressing the
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
habitual non-payer and um and thus
 
00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
stopping the burden being picked up by
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
the rest of the community
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsor when he spoke said that the
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
attorney could address some of the
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
questions about the imbalance between
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
the that's a different attorney I'm
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah that's somebody else that he
 
00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:22.609 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah that's somebody else that he
wants

00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
wants
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
ah but go ahead ask her a question but
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
my apologies I screwed up but perhaps
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps nevertheless you can help answer
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
this question
 
00:54:30.359 --> 00:54:32.150 align:start position:0%
this question
um

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
back to the imbalance that I referenced
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
in my question to the sponsor
 
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.190 align:start position:0%
in my question to the sponsor
um

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
there have been there's been some
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
discussion about the limitation of the
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
unpaid fees lien to six months
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
um as being an advantage in the mortgage
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
market and I can see where that could be
 
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.650 align:start position:0%
market and I can see where that could be
true

00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
um but the result is still that
 
00:55:02.339 --> 00:55:04.609 align:start position:0%
um but the result is still that
the

00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
again assuming that this doesn't this
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
bill isn't changed so that it applies
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
only to really abandoned units where
 
00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:18.059 align:start position:0%
uh everybody including the owner who's
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
away in Iraq or wherever it might be uh
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
would would have noticed
 
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.630 align:start position:0%
would would have noticed
um

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.329 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the two hundred
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar unit would be lost and
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about the loss to the
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
bank and I'm not talking about windfall
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
profit I'm talking about someone coming
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
home from say a long-term military
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
deployment or a long-term uh
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and discovering that
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
they have lost their home
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
um which is worth two hundred thousand
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars uh because of two thousand
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in unpaid condo fees
 
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.370 align:start position:0%
dollars in unpaid condo fees
um

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
address that issue sure I'll I'll do my
 
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.010 align:start position:0%
address that issue sure I'll I'll do my
best

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any situation like that
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
ever occurring
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
um there are safeguards for people in
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
the military where we don't have the
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
right to foreclose on them which would
 
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
apply in this case I believe and
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
um we also have an obligation to serve
 
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.270 align:start position:0%
um we also have an obligation to serve
individuals

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
right we have to go to court and we have
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
to effectuate proper good service of the
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
complaint upon the individuals and if we
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
cannot do that if we cannot make the
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
person an image individuals aware of the
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that's pending we have no right
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
to judgment in the courts
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
so there are safeguards in place where
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that outcome should never transpire
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
one further inquiry
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
would you see a problem in including a
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
change to this bill providing either a
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
minimum dollar amount or a minimum
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of the value of the unit in
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
unpaid condo fees before foreclosure and
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
sale would be an available option
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes I see a problem that because it it
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
really restricts the the effectiveness
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
of this if you have a unit that's worth
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
a million dollars
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
and the condo fees for this Association
 
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
are 250 dollars
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
how many years do we have to get before
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
we hit that threshold how many years of
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
the rest of the community have to carry
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
the burden for the remainder of the
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
owners so I do have a problem with that
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think the practically speaking we
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
don't see uh that issue I just don't see
 
00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:42.890 align:start position:0%
don't see uh that issue I just don't see
um

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.650 align:start position:0%
um
who

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:44.660 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
you were but by I guess creating a
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
percentage or minimum dollar amount
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
we're ignoring
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
what the condo fees are per month
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
um per se because you have some
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
communities with higher fees and some
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
with lower fees and and the value is it
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
the same right you could have a condo
 
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
unit that's worth two hundred thousand
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
dollars and the condo fees are 100 a
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
month and you have one where the condo
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
fees are 500 a month the valuation
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't change and why should the rights
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
be different under those two
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances I think a more uniform
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you all
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
right so Gary you get you get shuffled
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
down yes come on up
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
so Gary daddario's which represents
 
00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
so Gary daddario's which represents
Cai

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh good morning uh as the chairman
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned my name is Gary jadario I'm
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
also a condominium attorney I'm a
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
partner at the law firm of Marcus Rico
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
Ameren Brooks we represent associations
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
in several States throughout New England
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to start by addressing the
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
what I'll call the Deja Vu issue uh yes
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
we've been here before with this bill uh
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
yes it hasn't passed to date the reason
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
why we're back isn't because we like
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
doing this it's not because we are
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
willing to waste our time it's not
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
because we want to waste your time it's
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
because the need is still there for
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
these associations and if anything as
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
the years march on that need for this
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
law to be in place is increasing and
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here along those lines
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that I have been
 
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
focusing my practice in condominium and
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
Association law for the past 20 years
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
and what I'm seeing lately are things
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
that I've never seen before I'm seeing
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
associations with their year-end
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
financials year end no more movement no
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
more play are showing that they have
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
operated at a deficit for the year
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
simple mathematics tells us
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
associations can't do that indefinitely
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to pay their bills
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard a lot of this might
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
be utilities it might be the heat that's
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
keeping the pipes from freezing in the
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
winter but it's also the insurance on
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
the property and as I think most of you
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
know the insurance company's not going
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
to have a problem canceling that policy
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
if the premiums aren't paid so the idea
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
that associations don't have enough
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
money to pay their bills is a serious
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
problem and it's a serious problem for
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
everyone including the lenders
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
I would point out to this committee that
 
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
you have in the existing law of this
 
01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.450 align:start position:0%
you have in the existing law of this
state

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh budget process and a special
 
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
assessment process that allow
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
communities by a two-thirds vote to
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
reject what is proposed by their board
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
so understand please that when an
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
association is operating at a deficit
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
under the law it's not even as simple as
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
boards saying with
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
we have a shortfall unfortunately we're
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to make another assessment
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
to catch up on our money because if they
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
try to do that the community can simply
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
show up and say thanks but no thanks we
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't want another assessment and now
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
the assessment is rejected
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
so boards are being put you know between
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
a rock and a hard place to to use a
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
cliche expression
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and they really need some assistance
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
here uh you've heard a lot about the
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
inequities that result when some folks
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
are paying in the community and some
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
folks are not I'm going to use some
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
harshar terminology I think what you
 
01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:47.900 align:start position:0%
have in those instances is you have
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
forced private subsidized housing
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
because if I'm paying my condo fees and
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
any one of you are my neighbors you
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
might be right on the other side of the
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
wall and you're not paying your condo
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
fees and this is going on for years at a
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
time I and the other owners who are
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
paying the condo fees are make no
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
mistake about it we are subsidizing your
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
life and your investment in this piece
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
of Real Estate
 
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
and it's not fair when you consider that
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
these are all private parties in the
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
point of the association is to be
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
sharing in the expenses
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
so again there's a very real problem
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
that needs to be solved for the benefit
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
of all who are there you've heard that
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
there are possible negative consequences
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
to the market there's been a fair amount
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
of discussion of that
 
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to add some information for
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
you in that respect
 
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.210 align:start position:0%
you in that respect
Cai

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
Cai
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
on uh behalf of which I'm speaking today
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
and those letters by the way stand for
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
the community associations Institute
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
they are nationwide non-profit whose
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
existence is solely to make Association
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
living better that's the only thing they
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
ever try to do that's why they exist
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
because they operate on a national basis
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
they keep tabs on everything on a
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
national basis just so that you're aware
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are 21 states and two we'll say
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
districts who have priority liens
 
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.789 align:start position:0%
districts who have priority liens
um

01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
of all of them
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
any association in any of those places
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
with the sole exception of New Hampshire
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
can foreclose on their priority link
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
so to be clear again what you have in
 
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
terms of does it work does it break down
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
the market if we do this is there going
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be a problem is there a problem
 
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
to be a problem is there a problem
elsewhere

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:47.420 align:start position:0%
in response to all of those questions
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
know that there are 20 States
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
that allow associations a priority lien
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
and the ability to foreclose on it that
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
is also true of the District of Columbia
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
it is also true of Puerto Rico
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only state that has
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
a priority lien where we are still
 
01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:07.549 align:start position:0%
a priority lien where we are still
trying

01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
trying
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to have the association have
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
a right under the law to foreclose on
 
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
that lien
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
now you've also heard some testimony and
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
asked some questions about the process
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
in the concerns of the process is it
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to happen too fast is it going to
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
happen for too little money is it going
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
to Prejudice anybody who doesn't know
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I would say to you that the answers
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
to those questions are no
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
again under existing law associations
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
are filing their lien they're perfecting
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
their priority lien with six months owed
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
so no one's foreclosing on three months
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
no one's even foreclosing on six months
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
because at the six month marker they are
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
filing their priority lien in recording
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
their memorandum of lean with the
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds so now six months are
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
owed what happens next next if the
 
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
association isn't paid then they file
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
their lawsuit
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
when the lawsuits filed there's a
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
three-month period to achieve service of
 
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.150 align:start position:0%
three-month period to achieve service of
process

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's where we get into the issues of
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh has the lender
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
received their service a process by the
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
way the lender is entitled to not one
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
but two notices prior to the filing of
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
the suit so again the lender is going to
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
be keenly aware of the situation two
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
notices prior to suit then suit is filed
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
now we're at the six month Mark now
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
there's three months for service a
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
process during which time the lender is
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
being served the unit owner is being
 
01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:44.089 align:start position:0%
being served the unit owner is being
served

01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
um here's where we get into concerns
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
about military and so on uh someone
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
who's deployed in the military we're not
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
going to achieve service a process on
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
them and as attorney Shaughnessy
 
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you then the suit is going
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
because the court doesn't go forward
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
when you don't have service a process on
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
the defendant
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
but let's assume that service is made
 
01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
at that point the defendant has a month
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
give or take to answer to the complaint
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
after that month goes by and if an
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
answer is filed uh now we get into
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
motions that get filed in the case
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
whether they be for judgment or
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise as was mentioned to you a
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
hearing needs to be scheduled that gets
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
scheduled uh you know according to the
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
court and unfortunately most attorneys
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
will tell you that you know we wish uh
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
hearings would come sooner than they do
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
but the courts are busy so it takes time
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
after the hearing there's some time that
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
passes while the Court decides what they
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
want to do with the case before they
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
issue the Judgment when they do issue
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
the judgment
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
again the defendant has a month give or
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
take to make payment on that judgment
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
before anybody can try to further the
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
process so to be clear uh when we're
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
talking about foreclosure in a
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
condominium case we're not talking about
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars for six months of
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
condo fees that was when the lien was
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
filed then we got into the lawsuit then
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
service a process then the litigation
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
then the time for the hearing then the
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
judgment and so on foreclosure hasn't
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
happened in the 20 years that I've been
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
practicing I don't think I've ever seen
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
a condominium unit go to foreclosure in
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
this state or in Massachusetts where I
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
also practice I don't think I've seen a
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
unit go to foreclosure or in this case
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
Sheriff sale in New Hampshire in less
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
than a year's time and usually it's more
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
than that
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
to address for you the concerns about
 
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
legal fees again I cannot speak for
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
myself I can't speak for all attorneys
 
01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:43.010 align:start position:0%
myself I can't speak for all attorneys
but

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
um tens of thousands of attorney fees
 
01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
for the association in these cases no
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
not not for me ever in 20 years I've
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
never had fees of tens of thousands of
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
dollars even to foreclose on a unit if
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
the case ever goes that far and by the
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
way keeping stats on my practice as I do
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
in that 20 years time less than three
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
percent in the jurisdiction where I
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
could foreclose where the association
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
has the right to foreclose on a unit
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
less than three percent of all of my
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
cases ever reach that point
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
why is that well for one thing when you
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
can foreclose
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
now you have the ability to say this
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
case is going to end one way or the
 
01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.689 align:start position:0%
case is going to end one way or the
other

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
and guess what some of those unit owners
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
when they're faced with that situation
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
will do what they need to do
 
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
to pay the association maybe it means
 
01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259 align:start position:0%
taking out a loan or another mortgage
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
maybe it means you know in the worst
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
cases that they allow something else to
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
fall a little behind because the day has
 
01:08:47.809 --> 01:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
come to pay the association if things
 
01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:50.660 align:start position:0%
are tight but they make something happen
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
alternatively the bank the lender in the
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
situation can make something happen not
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the least of which by the way is that
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
they have the right and by the way
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's why they get the notices in the
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
first place
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
they have the right to make payments of
 
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
the assessments in in the standard
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
condominium Rider that goes with the
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
mortgages that they issue when folks are
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
buying these units it allows them if
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the association the
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
condo fees on the internet's behalf it
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
allows them to add that to the balance
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
of the mortgage
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
so ultimately that money is collectible
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
for them in the end the bank isn't
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
paying it out of their pocket they're
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
paying it as part of the debt of the
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
unit owner they have that option
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
um speaking of options of the bank or
 
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
lender as the case may be
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
um I would like to note that they have
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
options at the beginning options that
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
that never exist for the association
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
meaning that they pass judgment on the
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
applications that they receive they have
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
the ability to look over an application
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
and say we are approving this loan which
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
I assume they do when they feel
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
confident that they will be paid back
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
but conversely if they decide that they
 
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
don't want to give that loan they simply
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
reject that loan the association on the
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
other hand regardless of of what
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
Association we might be talking about
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
when a unit owner buys a unit
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's it no judgment call they're a
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
member of the association now and the
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
association is forced to deal with them
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
and if they're someone who doesn't pay
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
their bills then the association ends up
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
with a problem potentially a long-term
 
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:29.870 align:start position:0%
with a problem potentially a long-term
problem

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
and you know this foreclosure remedy as
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
you've heard before I can tell you for
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
all the associations I represent it
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be a last effort measure that you
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
would undertake in a case that just
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
didn't resolve by any other means that's
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
what it is you heard about the
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
association's other remedies they will
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
try those sometimes uh you know the
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
balance is paid because a lien gets
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
recorded on the on the unit and if that
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
balance is paid then that's great then
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
the case ends sometimes they're paid
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
because a judgment issued from the court
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
if so that's great then the case ends
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
you heard about
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
ceasing services to delinquent unit
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
owners the law does in New Hampshire
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
afford associations that right however
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the worst of these cases the unit
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
owners are not even at these units
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
they've either abandoned them or they
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
live elsewhere because this was
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
investment property they may even have
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
tenants in these units the point is if
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
they've decided to be a long-term
 
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
delinquent and if they're not on the
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
property and the association says no
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
more access to the pool for you
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
they simply do not care
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
and in the cases where they're refusing
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
to pay a court judgment doesn't make
 
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
them pay denying them access to the pool
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
isn't fruitful time has gone on you're
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
now over a year you might be at two
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
years then a really big question arises
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
and it's a difficult conversation for me
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
every single time when my clients say to
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
me how are we going to end this
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately under New Hampshire
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
law right now there isn't a good way to
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
bring any finality to the situation
 
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest to you that by
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
allowing associations to foreclose at
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
the end of a legal process where
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
everyone has noticed
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
it just isn't unfair it just isn't what
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
it is is it's fair to everyone else in
 
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
the association who is trying to meet
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
those responsibilities the financial
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
obligations that they all have
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
I will stop there I know we're having
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
issues with time and I want to make sure
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
that uh there can be questions if there
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
are any
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
I think they're all questioned out thank
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you got one more card
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
my name is Lee Greenwood I represent a
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
Socia associate is a the largest
 
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.530 align:start position:0%
Socia associate is a the largest
national

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
national
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
um Association Management Company in the
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
country we represent condos that manage
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
condo associations HOAs Etc we have been
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
active in New Hampshire for for over
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
four decades now we're a large presence
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
here we manage over make sure I get
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
these stats right about 25 000 units we
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
have about 150 employees in the granite
 
01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:37.669 align:start position:0%
have about 150 employees in the granite
state

01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
um so we've worked here for a while and
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I Gary's still a lot of my thunder
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be brief I promise you
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
all and did it much better than I ever
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
appreciated yes of course um but
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
honestly what this bill comes down to to
 
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
me is is two words equity and fairness
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
um words that we hear a lot today uh
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
around us and when I say that I I mean
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
in a couple of ways but but the main way
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
is that as Gary sort of alluded to an
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
association is a is a community right
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
and and that Community is made up of
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
individual unit owners that have entered
 
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
into a contract with the association so
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
every time they buy into that
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
Association they make they sign a
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
contract agreeing to pay their
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
assessments now the board of the
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
association of course creates a budget
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
pays fees Insurance maintenance the pool
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
if there is one
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
Etc and all of those fees as as for all
 
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
of us have to be paid for somehow so in
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
the cases where there is a delinquent
 
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.229 align:start position:0%
the cases where there is a delinquent
owner

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
those fees don't just get absorbed into
 
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
the air they have to be made up one way
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
or the other and and the way that
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're made up is is that the other
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
unit owners have to pay more and that to
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
me and and I think to a lot of us is
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
just an unfair inequate inequitable way
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the situation if if 99
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the people are are paying every month
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
as they're supposed to and as they're
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
contractually obligated to but one
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
percent isn't that's not fair for the 99
 
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.990 align:start position:0%
percent isn't that's not fair for the 99
percent

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and as Gary said foreclosure is of
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
course a last resort
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
um as it is in in the 21 other state or
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
20 other states that have super lean
 
01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:18.110 align:start position:0%
20 other states that have super lean
priority

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
um and also the Washington DC and Puerto
 
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
Rico so it really does come down to that
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
fairness issue
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and then just I just want to very
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
briefly mention um you know our our
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
friends in the banking Community
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that the the numbers that
 
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
we're talking about when when we're
 
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
talking about missed assessments or
 
01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
delinquent assessments certainly dwarf
 
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
compared to typically dwarf compared to
 
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:42.260 align:start position:0%
what a mortgage holder would have but
 
01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:44.900 align:start position:0%
you know let's think about that in scale
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers while it might be a few
 
01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a few thousand dollars
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
to an association really is the
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
difference between running your
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
Association or or not being able to pay
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
your bills so so yes it might be a
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
larger number on in some other kind of
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
liens but but in an association where
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
you have as few as a handful of unit
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
owners or as many as you know a couple
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
of hundred that really those numbers do
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
add up very quickly and as far as the
 
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
chilling effect
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
um concerns I I would just say that the
 
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
20 as Gary said in in 20 other states in
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
in DC and Puerto Rico the the condo
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
Market is robust people are are buying
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
and selling their condos I mean I am one
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
of them I live in Massachusetts I sorry
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
about that but I I live in Massachusetts
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm a condo owner and and you know I
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
can I can say that the market is robust
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
I don't have the data
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
um but but I I certainly know that that
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
those markets are are flourishing as and
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
those associations are doing well so I
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
will leave it there but I just did want
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
to leave one other thing with you all um
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
that then these numbers were kind of
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
shocking to me when I first saw them but
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
as of about a year year and a half ago
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are 267
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
000 New Hampshire residents who live in
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
an association of one form or another in
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
HOA a condo
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's roughly 20 percent of the
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
folks living in New Hampshire the
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire so this is a
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
housing model that that is growing that
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
people are are happy in and that uh you
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
know a large number of New Hampshire
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
residents have are have chosen to to buy
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
into so this is an important bill for us
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
we would uh we certainly would urge the
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
community to support it and and report
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
great uh representative fieldott has a
 
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:34.790 align:start position:0%
great uh representative fieldott has a
question

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a question
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
that was actually raised to me from your
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
your colleague it some of these units
 
01:17:44.209 --> 01:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
will be investment properties in which
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
you actually have tenants who are not
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
the ones who are directly paying the
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
mortgage how would this law and the
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
eviction mechanism in this law interact
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
with federal law such as the protection
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
of tenants at eviction act and how do
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
these two overlay as you've seen in
 
01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:01.340 align:start position:0%
other states with this type of provision
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really sure the answer to
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
that to be honest with you um I think I
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
would ask one of our attorney friends do
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
you do you have an answer that you can
 
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh the the question was so
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
how would they this type of provision
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
overlay with Federal protections for uh
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
tenants who are living in an investment
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
property such as the Federal Protection
 
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
of tenants at eviction act and is there
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
is there an introduction between this
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
tell you what why don't you think about
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
the answer for that one and then send an
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
email and to the committee to respond to
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
it well definitely but we'll so at least
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
when we take it up by the subcommittee
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
we'll hopefully get an answer to that
 
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:49.790 align:start position:0%
we'll hopefully get an answer to that
question

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
a short answer for now I don't think
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
there is a formal interplay because it's
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
named what we're talking about are
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
relatively new Provisions
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and by the way obviously my classes
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
towards associations that I spend my
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
career trying to help but all of these
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
new Provisions
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
um you know while I'm not looking for
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
people to be thrown out on the street
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's not my thing but to the extent
 
01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you don't have a mic and
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
so we'll just have to well wait send us
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
I submitted my written testimony to the
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
clerk this morning so okay great thank
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you all right having
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
no more cards I apologize representative
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
Almy will close this public hearing and
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
open up the next one
 
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 239
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:10.669 align:start position:0%
 
Lucy

01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:38.540 align:start position:0%
okay I'm a representative Susan Almy
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon Grafton 17. it's hard to
 
01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:45.980 align:start position:0%
remember the number
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
and I've been
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I started the condominium committee
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
and I've been on it all but one term
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
since then so you may be seeing me again
 
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.370 align:start position:0%
since then so you may be seeing me again
uh

01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
in fact next year for sure you will be
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
seeing me again with the bill that we
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
keep trying to get past but
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today on behalf of
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
a man who lives in Massachusetts and has
 
01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
a condominium in Lincoln
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
and he is a
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative of the very large group
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
of second homeowners in condominiums in
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
our state and they do pay property tax
 
01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:42.140 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
he has pointed out to me something that
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
I hadn't thought about before
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
in on
 
01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.729 align:start position:0%
in on
2017

01:21:51.729 --> 01:21:51.739 align:start position:0%
2017
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
on representative Webb bought brought in
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
a bill which said I can't manage to get
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
details about the budget and what's
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
going on in my Condominium Association I
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
want you to change the law
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
and you and
 
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:10.550 align:start position:0%
and you and
um

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
my committee to some extent also
 
01:22:17.649 --> 01:22:17.659 align:start position:0%
statutory committee on
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
worked on the language some and we came
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
up with what is in uh a was in HB 502 as
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
it was enacted and that is the first
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
three pages that you're looking at for
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
some reason the copiers decide to put my
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
testimony on the back
 
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.209 align:start position:0%
testimony on the back
um

01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
and uh he pointed out to me that
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
on there is nothing in the law that
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
requires condominium to produce any kind
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
of a reviewer audit of the finances and
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
hand them to the members there is in
 
01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:03.260 align:start position:0%
some bylaws including in his but uh his
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
condominium has been creative about of
 
01:23:07.679 --> 01:23:09.649 align:start position:0%
condominium has been creative about of
reinterpreting

01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
reinterpreting
 
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
the bylaws as well as the law that we
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
produced in 2017.
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
it's too easy in the condominium world
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
for boards or their property managers to
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
hide problems in the finances of their
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
operation particularly when most of the
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
owners are second homeowners and not
 
01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:32.990 align:start position:0%
owners are second homeowners and not
present

01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature took this stab at it
 
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.490 align:start position:0%
the legislature took this stab at it
um

01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:40.219 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
condo owners should be able to get
 
01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
sufficient information to know whether
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
their investment and for many of them
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
their residents is in trouble
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
when it isn't which is usually the case
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
on when there is a case of mismanagement
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
or Worse the owner has the documentary
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
proof that can
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
that has the documentary proof can form
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
a group to demand changes to take over
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
the board to correct the problem or to
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
go to court equipped to prove the case
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
and you have seen some of those come
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
here to testify in past terms and I have
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
seen more of them there was another
 
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
board in Plymouth switch without the any
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
information to their members on
 
01:24:38.209 --> 01:24:38.219 align:start position:0%
on loaned provided got a loan from the
 
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:42.620 align:start position:0%
local bank to pay for
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
overages in their expenses which were
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
above special assessments that they'd
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
done that they then used for other
 
01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.649 align:start position:0%
done that they then used for other
purposes

01:24:53.649 --> 01:24:53.659 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
and they gave the bank total control
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
over the checkbook of the of the
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association the bank was
 
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
receiving the deposits in the bank was
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh was okaying the expenses and this was
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
totally unknown to the people in the
 
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
condominium most of whom were second
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners and I was contacted by a
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
woman and spent the summer uh going
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
through the Grafton registry of deeds to
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
find these Bank contracts that they knew
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
nothing about which then helped that
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
woman to get the second homeowners
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
together to to confront the board and
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
get this solved
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
so um this kind of thing does happen
 
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
I hope it's rare it we found out a fair
 
01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
number of them in those of us that have
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
been on the condo board for more than
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
a condo committee for more than a term
 
01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.450 align:start position:0%
a condo committee for more than a term
um

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
because people come to us
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
but then people either decide that they
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
can't handle this and they're selling
 
01:26:14.110 --> 01:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
out no leaving New Hampshire
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
or they come to us and and we kind of
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
participate with them as they solve the
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
problem and then they don't come back to
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
talk to you about it again after the
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
first two years so on this
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
it does take years of met of
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
mismanagement sometimes for the for the
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
owners to begin to recognize that
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with their
 
01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.729 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with their
investment

01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
but it would be much better to do a real
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
independent audit every year or every
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
few years to reassure the owners
 
01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.139 align:start position:0%
on we do not now require any kind of
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
independent audit whether the kind my
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
complex does by hiring an independent
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
accountant actually to check our bank
 
01:27:09.129 --> 01:27:09.139 align:start position:0%
statements against our bills
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
or the very thorough kind that Mr Bob
 
01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:15.380 align:start position:0%
simck behind me is proposing
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
his small Association is run through the
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
board by an external manager who audits
 
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.729 align:start position:0%
board by an external manager who audits
himself

01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
himself
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
and then says everything's fine
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
Mr simic has spent years trying to use
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
37 e on
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
two to demand an independent and
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
thorough examination of the books
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
the board has denied him he has hired a
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
lawyer and a CPA to help him uh I bring
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
you this bill because I think that it
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
seems likely it would make it easier to
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
get this audit or to convince a court to
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
requirement with language that more
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
closely follows the auditing process
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
the bill Builds on the 2017 law
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
it expands on the second section
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
the first part on which we've relabeled
 
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:21.139 align:start position:0%
on I'm Roman 2A treats the information
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
specified in 2017 is a subset of all the
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
relevant financial data that should be
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
made available to an inquiring member
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
right now it talks about contracts
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
mortgages on debts long-term commitments
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that has been very important in some
 
01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
cases that I've dealt with before but it
 
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
does not talk about the current
 
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.490 align:start position:0%
does not talk about the current
um

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:52.209 --> 01:28:52.219 align:start position:0%
um the on
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
accounts of the association and the bank
 
01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:58.490 align:start position:0%
accounts of the association and the bank
statements

01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
statements
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
which can give you an idea if there is
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
something strange going on in in the
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
finances uh section Roman 2B adds a
 
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
requirement that every condominium board
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
should be providing the members with an
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
independent review of all books and
 
01:29:21.729 --> 01:29:21.739 align:start position:0%
records at least once every three years
 
01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
this is purposely vague enough that it
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
could be done at minor expense
 
01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh in my Association we've got 22 mem to
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
owners on it is
 
01:29:35.159 --> 01:29:36.530 align:start position:0%
owners on it is
um

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's done annually for three hundred
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
dollars just checking the bank
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
statements against the billing
 
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.129 align:start position:0%
statements against the billing
uh

01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
and uh it goes on to say that any owner
 
01:29:52.729 --> 01:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
or owners at their own expense will have
 
01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
access to do a more detailed audit as
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
long as such an audit has not been done
 
01:29:59.689 --> 01:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
within the last three years so it
 
01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:01.580 align:start position:0%
protects from
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
the kind of member who
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
watch every single detail of the
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
association's life for for every single
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
month which I experienced early in my
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
time in Condominiums
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
on but it
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
does say that every within every once
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
every three years if a member or their
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
members thinks that there is something
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
strange going on can get a real audit
 
01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
but they'll have to pay for it
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
on Romans 3 C
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh 2C keeps the second part of the
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
original language about privacy of
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
individual owners accounts but adds that
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
the auditor with adequate privacy
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
protection should be able to see those
 
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.570 align:start position:0%
protection should be able to see those
accounts

01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:55.580 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
I had one case recently where a woman
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
was in a four-person condominium and
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
when she moved in after she moved in she
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
realized that she was paying a lot more
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
than any of the other three people
 
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:09.950 align:start position:0%
than any of the other three people
foreign

01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
and that two of the people had been put
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
in there specifically by the owner for
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
so on
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
um I I just like to end there but ask
 
01:31:28.729 --> 01:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
you to call on Mr simic next and then
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
the others so that he can explain better
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
than I can
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding the difference
 
01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:51.260 align:start position:0%
between 2A oh I just lost it I'm sorry
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
the paragraph after that and 2B so 2B is
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
saying that you know every three years
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
we can have an audit and if you want
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
additional details you know you would
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
pay for that
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
to a is kind of indicating that
 
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
they have access to all kinds of things
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
are you saying that an owner can ask
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
the condo association to start printing
 
01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.390 align:start position:0%
the condo association to start printing
out

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
reams of information that on a whim just
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
because they want it
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I experienced this when I was first
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
in a condo association after I came back
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
to this country on and it was a neighbor
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
a new neighbor of mine and yes he he was
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
insisting on printouts this does not
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
mention printouts it says access to what
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
do you mean by access just that you have
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
to make the books available or yes that
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
on that person can go to your office and
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
on and check
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
the financial books
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
in the case where you talk about owners
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
being out of state
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
yes and that that is somewhat of a
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
problem that when the owners only arrive
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
on weekends and uh frankly
 
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
on weekends and uh frankly
um

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
I would hope that an owner that cared
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
that much about it could come on on a
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
weekday what has happened with the
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
gentleman behind me is that he set up in
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
a a time to come and meet they told him
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
he had an hour they spent 40 minutes of
 
01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
it with his lawyer arguing about whether
 
01:33:39.169 --> 01:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
they had to do it and then said you've
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
only got 20 minutes left
 
01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:50.689 align:start position:0%
only got 20 minutes left
foreign

01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
normally the procedurally we would uh
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
have uh a representative who wants to
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you appreciate
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
having the opportunity to uh to speak
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
with you all my name is Bob simack I'm a
 
01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
condominium unit owner at the loonwood
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
Lincoln that's over on the side of Loon
 
01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.050 align:start position:0%
Lincoln that's over on the side of Loon
Mountain

01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:32.060 align:start position:0%
Mountain
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
I am
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
a small business owner I run an oncology
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
nutrition business I'm also the
 
01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
treasurer of a non-profit organization
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
this is my first experience in what I'll
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
call Managed living
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
I asked a bunch of questions at my first
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
annual meeting of the of the board in
 
01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.410 align:start position:0%
annual meeting of the of the board in
2020

01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that put me on a certain trajectory
 
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
let's say I will say uh thank you to
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative almi and uh I'd say
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
overall the the new 356b Financial
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
disclosure language she's proposing or
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
is being proposed here could be quite
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial in supporting a single unit
 
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
owner or small group of unit owners who
 
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
are struggling to gain access to
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
financial information in their Condo
 
01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.209 align:start position:0%
financial information in their Condo
Association

01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh the the first thing I would point out
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the language in 37 E2
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
it starts out quite optimistically uh
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
saying each unit owner shall have access
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
to all financial information however you
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
take you continue to read the sentence
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
and it's really specific to contracts
 
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
which are debatable I suppose I mean we
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
have a contract with the bank does that
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
mean I can get bank statements it
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically stay I can get bank
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
statements why shouldn't I be able to
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
get bank statements it's my money in the
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
bank account
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh mortgages loans in terms of loans
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
um we don't have any of those but great
 
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
that that's good outstanding debts and
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
balances on all accounts held by the
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
Association well if you take this
 
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
literally like my uh my board of
 
01:36:00.970 --> 01:36:00.980 align:start position:0%
directors and property managers uh have
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh that that would require them to give
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
me two numbers one for uh our operating
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
account and one for our Reserve account
 
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's all we we we we would get from
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
this any records uh supporting expenses
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
that one might want to uh take a look at
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
and which my board has has always said
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
the door is open in Campton New
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just come on down you can look
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
at everything and then as soon as I said
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm coming they said not so fast and
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
then they broke their own rules and said
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
well I'll just copy you some stuff and
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
then I get an incomplete and incorrect
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
copy of whatever and this has been going
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
on and going on and going on that's just
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the process we don't
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
have time here to go into all the
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
details of it but I would say as um as
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
both a condominium owner and the owner
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
of a business because these are
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
businesses I I would say that unit
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
owners should uh should have more
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
explicit access through this language to
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
the books and records of of an associate
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
of their Association
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
even after I declared I was going to
 
01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
audit my Association in accordance with
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
our bylaws my board reference 37 E2 and
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
stated they're not required to provide
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
access to the association books the
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
general ledger or tax returns it's
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely impossible to do a basic
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
financial statement review without
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
access to the general ledger it was
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
denied me
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
that was phase one now we're on phase
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
I think if I if I'm looking at 2A uh 37
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
e 2A I I think if I were to prioritize
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
some of that because it was mentioned
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
that there's a there's a there's a whole
 
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff in there
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
um I would prioritize bank statements
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that from a general
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
awareness budget tracking and management
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
point of view bank statements are
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
probably the best single resource
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
available to unit owners especially unit
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
owners that are not part of the board
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I I was told our bank statements
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be available in person at the
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
property manager's office like I
 
01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:02.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh and and and and that's fine
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
except the the property manager's office
 
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
is open on weekdays they're you know
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
from from nine to 4 30 or whatever I
 
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
live in Dover Massachusetts
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
generally it's a weekend warrior thing
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know you go up to the place and
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're using it on the weekend it's it's
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
not that easy to uh to get there
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I took I took a closer look at that
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't practical for me so I
 
01:38:25.490 --> 01:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
did the homework I spoke with the Bank
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's where we do our
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
banking uh and I also spoke with other
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
um other associations with regards to
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
how to make uh you know just access the
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
bank statements a little bit easier uh
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
and found that uh
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
um there's easy ways to satisfy banking
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
privacy laws and it's easy to truncate
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
and or eliminate account numbers for
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
security purposes either formally
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
through the bank by having a program
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
through them to do a quote-unquote unit
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
on a ready bank statement or um uh or by
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
simply getting out of Sharpie
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I offered a bunch of different Opera
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
options to my uh to my board they were
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
they were all uh all denied uh so you
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
know if I want a timely access to my
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
bank statements I've got to go you know
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
from Dover to Camden during the weekday
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
hours 12 times a year to get those
 
01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.070 align:start position:0%
hours 12 times a year to get those
um

01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
I would say in closing with regards to
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
the bank statements that you know in
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
this day and age when most banking is
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
done via electronic means and including
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
banking at our association it would seem
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable to add language uh that
 
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
appropriately crafted bank statements I
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
mean you got to be respectful of privacy
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
laws Etc uh be made available uh to unit
 
01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:44.510 align:start position:0%
laws Etc uh be made available uh to unit
owners

01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
with regards to Association uh Financial
 
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
audits uh I would say that obtaining
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
Financial transparency from an
 
01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:55.940 align:start position:0%
entrenched HOA or condo association
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
board can be extremely difficult the
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
loan unit owner a group of unit owners
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
May encounter significant obstacles in
 
01:40:04.689 --> 01:40:04.699 align:start position:0%
gaining access to financial information
 
01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
I was quite pleased to find a unit owner
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
audit provision uh in in my bylaws as
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Al May mentioned although
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
I continue to deal with significant
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
difficulties costs and stress if it was
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
not for that bylaw I would have been
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
dead in the water I wouldn't be maybe
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
not here today I I would say that adding
 
01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
language that that allows unit owners
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to conduct their own
 
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
audits levels the playing field the
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
board can always do their audit but the
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
unit owner can't necessarily do theirs
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
um with that said uh uh and as the
 
01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
language in 2B
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
points out
 
01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
points out
um

01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
uses the word obtaining an independent
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
review I I would say now having gone
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
through what I've gone through that true
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
Independence uh and avoidance of
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest or something uh to
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
be uh considered uh in in this in this
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
regard my Treasurer at one point after
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
he discovered and seemed like the whole
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
board discovered for the first time that
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
we hadn't been audited in 30 years uh
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
the property manager knew that very well
 
01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
and quickly pointed out six reasons why
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
we don't need an audit
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
um uh he he decided a few months later
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
to go down to Campton and take a look at
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
the books and records and report it back
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
at a subsequent board meeting that
 
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
everything was fine
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
and I applauded that I'm like this is
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
great that's I'm just I'm just trying to
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know get some uh more transparency
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
and visibility into the process and the
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
numbers uh so I asked them afterwards
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know could I could we speak a little
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
bit about you know what you did what
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
your scope was you know just get some
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
idea of what you did and the answer was
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
one word
 
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.010 align:start position:0%
one word
no

01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
no I think the bylaws actually requires
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
them you know if he's going to go down
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
there and spend money and the PM's going
 
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
to spend money that he was you know he
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
owed us something uh but you know we
 
01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
didn't get it so
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I so I would suggest that
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
any language
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
um uh with regards to audits provide for
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
Independence certainly you can have an
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
outside uh accountant uh you know
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
conduct an audit
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
um often there's relationships with with
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
those accountants already and there's
 
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
also easily a hundred different ways to
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
do audits
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
um you know having a board of directors
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
with perhaps inputs from the property
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
manager decide on the type of audit and
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
then managing the process delivering the
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
the results is a clear conflict of
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
interest in my mind both my board and P
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
and property manager have been trying to
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
dictate my audit efforts since day one
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
um uncovering fraud and embezzlement
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
well first of all fraud and embezzlement
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
is is real in this space it happens
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
Stone management being the most recent
 
01:42:43.209 --> 01:42:43.219 align:start position:0%
example down in Waterville Valley
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
forensic accounting and a forensic
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
examination of the books is totally
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
different approach totally different
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
skill set uh versus doing just a
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
financial statement on it both have
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous value if the unit owners
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
could be involved in that and there
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
could be uh you know just other uh you
 
01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:02.219 align:start position:0%
know inputs
 
01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I think there's value in that you
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
know non-board members should have the
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be involved in any audit
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
process I would go further and say and
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is not in the language uh
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
as presented offering the option for
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
associations to assemble an audit
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
Committee of non-board unit owners makes
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
sense and removes that obvious conflict
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh of boards auditing themselves I don't
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
think that should require a vote I think
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
it should just be there and and they can
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
do it if they want or or not certainly
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
you know any budget uh allocated for um
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
for auditing purposes needs to be voted
 
01:43:37.619 --> 01:43:39.470 align:start position:0%
for auditing purposes needs to be voted
on

01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I do have a copy of
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh more uh that I put together that I
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
could uh provide uh in terms of the my
 
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
remarks but that that was all I uh
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's all I had great
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we do have a question
 
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for taking the question
 
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
this is a quick one
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
I'll wait till you come back
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.609 --> 01:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
thanks a lot okay I can talk while
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome back
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is simple do you have any
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
insight as to why you're being
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
stonewalled by your Association on this
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just just curious why
 
01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
why they're doing this um
 
01:44:22.129 --> 01:44:22.139 align:start position:0%
at first I thought they just didn't like
 
01:44:22.139 --> 01:44:23.750 align:start position:0%
at first I thought they just didn't like
me

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think they do
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
um so the question was is that all it is
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
but now two years or actually over two
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
years later I
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
it and it's just conjecture
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
I think there's something going on there
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know because I'm asking specific
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
questions and we're kind of beyond the
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
we don't like them I mean we don't like
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
them but they're going to Extraordinary
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
Measures spending a lot of money on
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
their attorneys is what their attorneys
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
are involved and uh and not only that
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
but but now we see with the upcoming
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh annual meeting
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
the board has has said what we're going
 
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
to try to do now since this has been so
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
contentious and confusing to them uh
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get rid of this unit
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
owner audit provision and we're going to
 
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
put that up for vote at the annual
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
meeting in three or four weeks so and
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
this is the this concludes perhaps a
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
half a dozen different rule changes
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
where it started what is come to Campton
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
the door is open nope not so fast we'll
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
give you copies back and forth on the
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
copies oh okay now you can do an audit
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
Bob you need a CPA and this is how it's
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to work okay let's do that we show
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
up representative almi mentioned got 30
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
minutes maybe 25 uh you know in in the
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
building not enough time my accountant
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
is frantically just trying to copy stuff
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
and and now we're to the point where
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to shut this down we're
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to get the vote we're going to
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
shut it down
 
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
so I you know I don't know is there
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
embezzlement going on here I I don't
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm just trying to do an audit I'm
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
just trying to let the facts
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to follow the facts but
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
I can't even I can't even so I I
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the first one done the
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
financial statement audit and now we're
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
basically doing more of a fraud
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
examination and they can't even get
 
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:08.930 align:start position:0%
examination and they can't even get
started

01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and just for the
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
record my neighbors don't like me either
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't worry about that
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I wouldn't worry about work my
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
neighbors don't like me either so don't
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
worry about it if I was worried about
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
that okay well representative people
 
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
don't worry about that and they're and
 
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
that's why there's just one of me here
 
01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:29.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh maybe I should
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
address this to representative elmy but
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
I don't see any teeth in here I mean I
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
don't know much about these things but I
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
see nothing in here that would prevent
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
your your folks from just saying no
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
again is there a way to put some teeth
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
into yeah you have to look at the whole
 
01:46:48.119 --> 01:46:49.270 align:start position:0%
into yeah you have to look at the whole
statute

01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
you're only looking at a little piece of
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
the statue you have to look at all three
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
502 356.
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you um okay I would
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
just say uh you know with regards to
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
electronic bank statements that that
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
that language is not in there uh and
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
adding a non-board uh member audit
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
um okay now well it's been timed uh who
 
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
is in opposition to the Bell
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
they're like Gary you're like yes and
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're like it's parts of it and you
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
don't like some of it
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman will infantine
 
01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman will infantine
Hillsboro

01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:37.550 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
um

01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
16. I am in favor of the bill I have
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
concerns with some of the wording I've
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
been on a number of boards as I said uh
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
over the years and transparency with
 
01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
finances is always Paramount and it
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
should be okay there's no reason in
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
today's technology I'm on two boards
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
right now A homeowners association and a
 
01:47:58.129 --> 01:47:58.139 align:start position:0%
Condo Association every month I got a
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
list I got the bank statements I got a
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
list of every bill is paid we have to
 
01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
get copies of the checks it's pretty
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
simple with today's technology to
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
provide that as a board member every
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
month to review the the information and
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
then to give it to anyone who wants to
 
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
see it via email whatever so I have no
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
most bylaws I've seen allow
 
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
for individuals to be able to go at a
 
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
certain place at a certain time that's
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go look at the information
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um so yeah you're paying the bill you
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
should be able to see where the money's
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
going to the problem I have is is in
 
01:48:38.699 --> 01:48:39.709 align:start position:0%
going to the problem I have is is in
section

01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
um B in the CPA world there's a
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
difference between a compilation to
 
01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
review and an audit it's all
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
verification of a certain amount it's
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
it's all a level of verification
 
01:48:53.169 --> 01:48:53.179 align:start position:0%
compilation is the simplest it looks
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
pre-verification an average comp
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
compilation would be twenty five to
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars a review
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
statement does a little more
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
um uh independent review they send uh
 
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to check bank statements
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to send out a certain
 
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
amount of letters to all the receivables
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
and payables to make sure and get a get
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
the response back that they're accurate
 
01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:16.940 align:start position:0%
and an audit full-blown audit you know
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
review review could be five to seven
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
thousand an audit could be ten thousand
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
dollars so while I respect
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative almi for having as she
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
said a purposely vague uh comments in uh
 
01:49:33.050 --> 01:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
or wording in lines nine and ten
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
some words were mixed around if you're
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
going to have an independent review be
 
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
careful when you use the word review
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
because what it possibly means are you
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
talking about a CPA review
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
which is going to cost five or seven
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year that's okay for
 
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
100 unit Association but not for a 10
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
unit Association
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
I said a significant expense
 
01:49:54.659 --> 01:49:55.550 align:start position:0%
I said a significant expense
um

01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:57.410 --> 01:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's also difficult to get a CPA or
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
anyone to do something every three years
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
so you're going to say I did it this
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
year I'm not going to wait three years
 
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what happened in
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
between so I got to go back and look at
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
everything else in between there to make
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure that my third year audit is going
 
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with follow-through
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
with what I did in the audit three years
 
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.609 align:start position:0%
with what I did in the audit three years
ago

01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
this independent review what does that
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
mean a guy who in your neighbor who does
 
01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
an HR H R Block thing for everybody does
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
their taxes at the end of the year or is
 
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
it a CPA
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
is it someone within the association is
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
that someone not
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh the previous uh the gentleman
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
testified didn't think that it was okay
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
to have someone within the association
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
do it they didn't think they were
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
I a step away from it
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
so I think the warning just needs to be
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
clarified there because if you're asking
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
everyone to do an independent review or
 
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
have a CPA do it it's as significant
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
expense I'd rather have that say may
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
obtain because some associations do I've
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
gone to Association meetings where we
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
had had a police officer there in case
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
things got out of hand other
 
01:50:59.209 --> 01:50:59.219 align:start position:0%
associations everybody looks the numbers
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's happy it all varies
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay so everyone should have the right
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
to see information make a schedule make
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
an appointment go see it get all the
 
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:09.659 align:start position:0%
information everything should be
 
01:51:09.659 --> 01:51:11.390 align:start position:0%
information everything should be
transparent

01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
how you do it in B is very important
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
because it could be very costly so I
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
would hope that that could be
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
um tightened up a bit Mr chairman thank
 
01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.990 align:start position:0%
um tightened up a bit Mr chairman thank
you

01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:29.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
yes

01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:51:34.850 --> 01:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
um on lot
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
on line 11 it states any owner at their
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
own expense
 
01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:44.219 align:start position:0%
May demand a more detailed audit
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the owner it seems to pay
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the audit he's looking at the first
 
01:51:51.490 --> 01:51:51.500 align:start position:0%
sentence look at nine and ten
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
the first sentence says they have to do
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
an independent review if they do a bare
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
basis compilation and that's not
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the person that wants more
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
and they want to pay a CPA to do an
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
audit and pay the extra five or seven
 
01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to do so
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay knock yourself out but nine and ten
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
I think the lines nine and ten need to
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
to the kind of Association
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr thank you very much
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
who wrote support and oppose but only
 
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
one to two minutes so you're gonna be
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
brief right uh I am yes thank you
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
um by the way just uh to make sure
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
records are straight uh did I invert the
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
number at all on that card I don't know
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
if I wrote the right number 2 2 39 you
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
got it right okay thank you uh okay so
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
for the record once again my name is
 
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
Gary Daddario I'm an attorney and a
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
partner with Marcus Erico Ameren Brooks
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh we focus our practice on community uh
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
law and condominium law so you know this
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
is what we do this is what I do on a
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
professional basis day in and day out I
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
am certainly not here to say that I have
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
any issue with transparency or with
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
associations financials being accurate
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
or with there being mechanisms for them
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
to be accurate so really I only have two
 
01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts for you to consider
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
one is in I believe it's 2C where there
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
is reference to individual accounts and
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
that the individual account sort of
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
becomes part of the publicly available
 
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
information if there is a lien against
 
01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
that unit owner I would caution that
 
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
that may not be enough from the
 
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the federal fair debt
 
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
collection practices act that act
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
prohibits the release of information
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
about an account to third parties and as
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
of right now it is uncertain whether or
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
not they even consider the mortgage
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
holder Who provided that two hundred
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the unit to be
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
purchased to be a third party so I have
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
to believe that they would consider all
 
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
of the other unit owners and whoever
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
they might share that information with
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be third parties and so while the
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
lien itself that exists at the registry
 
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
is a public record and would show that
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
that unit owner owes a particular dollar
 
01:54:26.649 --> 01:54:26.659 align:start position:0%
amount at least at a certain time
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
their account information would be a
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
different story their account
 
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
information might show more of a balance
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
it might show partial payments or or
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
payments or you know a checkered payment
 
01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.410 align:start position:0%
payments or you know a checkered payment
history

01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:41.420 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
it could have any number of of pieces of
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
information in an individual unit or
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
account that if shared would expose the
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
association to that liability for
 
01:54:54.649 --> 01:54:54.659 align:start position:0%
sharing that information with a third
 
01:54:54.659 --> 01:54:55.729 align:start position:0%
sharing that information with a third
party

01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I think there might need to be some
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
tweaking there so that associations are
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
not uh required by New Hampshire law to
 
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
give up information that might otherwise
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
violate the applicable federal statute
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
um just something to to consider I'm
 
01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
sure it can be worked around
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
um but again something to consider my
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
second thought it relates back to the
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill that we just got finished talking
 
01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.590 align:start position:0%
bill that we just got finished talking
about

01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
and my thought is this I would ask you
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
to to give serious consideration to
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
whether or not you legislatively impose
 
01:55:35.590 --> 01:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
on associations additional
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses in their
 
01:55:41.689 --> 01:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
operations if they are going to continue
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
to be unable to end delinquency cases
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
even when unit owners haven't paid them
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
for one to two years
 
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
because whether we're talking about
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars for a simple review
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
or thousands of dollars for more complex
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
review if an association is suffering
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
with long-term delinquents and if years
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
are ticking by with balances growing and
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
condo fees not coming in and if they
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't have an ability to do something
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
like a foreclosure to end those cases to
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
get paying owners in those units then I
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
I just don't think it makes sense some
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
of them as I mentioned in my prior
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
testimony when you're having trouble
 
01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
making ends meet now they're operating
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
at a deficit so I I think we should be
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
careful uh in telling associations that
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
by law you're going to have to incur
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
additional expenses
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that's all I I have on this
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
generally speaking again no problem with
 
01:56:38.810 --> 01:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
financial transparency just I think a
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
couple of things that need to be
 
01:56:40.199 --> 01:56:41.870 align:start position:0%
couple of things that need to be
considered

01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
great um so when we do our subcommittee
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
you might want to come in with
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
texts that you think is probably more
 
01:56:49.930 --> 01:56:49.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate sure
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no questions thank you
 
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay having no more cards we'll close
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on 239 and and the
 
01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
blue sheet did we get the blue sheet for
 
01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:04.790 align:start position:0%
blue sheet did we get the blue sheet for
239

01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
239
 
01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:15.169 align:start position:0%
239
nope

01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.450 --> 01:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm not going to worry about
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
it at this moment so we'll just open go
 
01:57:21.729 --> 01:57:21.739 align:start position:0%
ahead because we're really late now
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative magnitude you're going to
 
01:57:29.159 --> 01:57:30.470 align:start position:0%
representative magnitude you're going to
testify

01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
I don't have the
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsors card
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Davis here
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
good morning and I apologize for our
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
lateness thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee
 
01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I want to start by offering you two
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
apologies and one is that on the copy of
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have before you at
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
least I believe that's true the
 
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors are not listed and they are
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
lafa mangaputi and Eric Gallagher
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh and my second apology is that I
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
intend to um
 
01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
to work up a slight Amendment to the
 
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
bill which I will talk about
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
um in in just a few minutes so thank you
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that seeks to
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
um provide some protections for
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations which come in
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
all shapes sizes and colors in this
 
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.229 align:start position:0%
all shapes sizes and colors in this
state

01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
from the purchase by a single corporate
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
entity or one individual of all the
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
majority of the units in the development
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh these homeowners associations do not
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
enjoy the protection of any New
 
01:58:51.609 --> 01:58:51.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
as do condominium associations
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations are most for the
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
most part organized under the voluntary
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
associations chapter of New Hampshire
 
01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:03.950 align:start position:0%
associations chapter of New Hampshire
law

01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
section 292.
 
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:11.540 align:start position:0%
and uh and so this seeks to prevent
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
undo expenditures that would fall to a
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
municipality should a majority owner
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
purchase the majority of homes or all of
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
the homes in a homeowners association
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
and therefore the municipality that
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
approved the homeowners association
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
development in the first place would be
 
01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
stuck with the costs of infrastructure
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
of maintaining that Community which
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
would normally devolve upon the
 
01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.750 align:start position:0%
would normally devolve upon the
homeowners

01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill attempts to do
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
and it is an amendment to the voluntary
 
01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
associations chapter under which many
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations in this state
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
and other states are formed
 
01:59:58.609 --> 01:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that I mentioned a
 
02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
little earlier would be under in line
 
02:00:02.099 --> 02:00:03.770 align:start position:0%
little earlier would be under in line
seven

02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh under Roman numeral two and it would
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
say no homeowners association
 
02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
constituted under this chapter and
 
02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
approved by a planning board shall be
 
02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:16.970 align:start position:0%
approved by a planning board shall be
dissolved

02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
prior to a hearing under RSA 676 colon 2
 
02:00:25.609 --> 02:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
before that planning board so in other
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
words I'm I'm taking out the possibility
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
that a homeowners association that does
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
not have any planning Board review and
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
approval would be would enjoy the same
 
02:00:34.679 --> 02:00:35.810 align:start position:0%
approval would be would enjoy the same
protection

02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
protection
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh that that this would under under this
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the sum total of it I thank
 
02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
you for listening and I'd be happy to
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.129 --> 02:00:52.139 align:start position:0%
so go for me because I was maybe a pain
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
enough attention what exactly is the
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
problem do we have a historic event that
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
occurred what can you walk me through
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
something that that occurred that was so
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
problematic that we need to pass this
 
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.870 align:start position:0%
problematic that we need to pass this
legislation

02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
we have a worry not not a historic event
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
but a worry about a future event
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh we have investors coming into our
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners association on a regular
 
02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.729 align:start position:0%
homeowners association on a regular
basis

02:01:18.729 --> 02:01:18.739 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
asking residents what's it going to take
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
to get you to move
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
I have a check right here how big do you
 
02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
need the check to be
 
02:01:31.089 --> 02:01:31.099 align:start position:0%
and these are usually corporations
 
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
Hospitality corporations that would like
 
02:01:36.169 --> 02:01:36.179 align:start position:0%
to purchase all or a majority of the
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
homes in the HOA and turn them into
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
so not a historic event but worry about
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh Margaret burns from
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association I
 
02:02:04.619 --> 02:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association I
assume

02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
is uh opposed to the bill I'm good
 
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
morning uh members of the committee my
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
name is Margaret Burns I'm the executive
 
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:18.589 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Municipal
Association

02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
um we are opposed to the bill but only
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to paragraph two or section
 
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
two which deals with the required
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
planning the required hearing before a
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
planning board in the event of a
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
dissolution of a homeowners association
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to Representatives Davis
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
before the hearing about the amendment
 
02:02:38.089 --> 02:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
that she spoke to the committee about
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
just a moment ago and I think it would
 
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
fix our concerns with the bill as
 
02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
written Our concern right now is that a
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
hearing would be required before a
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
planning board even in a certain
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
situation where the HOA wasn't a
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
condition of approval on the subdivision
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
or the site plan for that particular
 
02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
development and we don't want to create
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
a situation where planning boards are
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
put into a private home owner type
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
situation where they really don't have
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority but in some
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
instances when site plans or
 
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
subdivisions are approved the planning
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
board will actually make it a condition
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
of approval that a homeowners
 
02:03:19.129 --> 02:03:19.139 align:start position:0%
association be formed for the specific
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
reason of taking care of Maintenance or
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
preserving conservation land or other
 
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
easements because it's a privately owned
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
development as opposed to one that is
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
creating public roads or other public
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that the town would
 
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
normally have the responsibility for so
 
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
we completely understand what it's
 
02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
seeking to address but with the
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that Representatives Davis
 
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
described it would probably take care of
 
02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
the concern we have about mandating a
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
planning board hearing in all
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances of an HOA dissolution so
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
that is all I have for Testimony I won't
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
prolong my testimony but I am happy to
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
02:04:00.659 --> 02:04:03.290 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
has

02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:06.229 align:start position:0%
foreign
okay

02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
um normally the I would think
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association wouldn't take
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
an opinion on a bill that's
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the words of uh
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk it used to be
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
prophylactic we were trying to solve a
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
problem before it occurs uh so and and
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
obviously increasing responsibilities
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
now the town we get involved in it so
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
are you not concerned that that this is
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
a preventative medicine rather than
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
addressing a problem that really
 
02:04:40.609 --> 02:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
occurred again we support the intent of
 
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
the bill and the issue it's trying to
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
fix the reason that we have opposition
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
is that it mandates a planning board
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
hearing in all circumstances even where
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
the planning board has not exercised its
 
02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
local authority to require that HOA to
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
be formed in the first place so you are
 
02:04:59.930 --> 02:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent correct normally we
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
would not take a position on a bill
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's seeking to actually
 
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
get ahead of a potential issue down the
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
road the concern is that planning boards
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
will be required to hold a hearing even
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
where they have no regulatory Authority
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to the the HOA dissolution
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
which could create a lot of confusion
 
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
both for planning boards as well as for
 
02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners in the HOA so the amendment
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
described I think would ameliorate that
 
02:05:28.570 --> 02:05:28.580 align:start position:0%
issue got it
 
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions I think we've seen
 
02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
done thank you very much thank you
 
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative valmie wants to
 
02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
reps have Susan Almay on Grafton 17 on
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
you asked about his historical incident
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
we have already had one and we came
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
before this committee to provide a
 
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
solution which I I thought was
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
completely inadequate and I like this
 
02:06:00.970 --> 02:06:00.980 align:start position:0%
one better but it was when
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the Eastern Lakes Region I
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
believe there was a group of people that
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
were friends in Massachusetts that put
 
02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
together a homeowners association on and
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
on a lake and they built their nice
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
homes next to it and on they were
 
02:06:25.129 --> 02:06:25.139 align:start position:0%
planning on selling other Lots in order
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
to get them to uh
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
on to pay back some of their expenses
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
and they were not getting anybody buying
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
them because the market was not good at
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
that point and they um
 
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
they dissolved the homeowners
 
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
association by themselves
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
10 years later they decided to start
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
trying to sell a lots again the market
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
was better people moved in there was an
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
a voluntary agreement made that
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
everybody would pay into the common pot
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
to pay for snow plowing and things like
 
02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:08.109 align:start position:0%
to pay for snow plowing and things like
that

02:07:08.109 --> 02:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
and ten years after that the original
 
02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:15.020 align:start position:0%
board which was still running the place
 
02:07:18.290 --> 02:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
decided that we can get some of our
 
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
money back from those earlier years and
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
they made it they they refiled as the
 
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
homeowners association
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
and they then sent a bill to the people
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
the new people telling them that they
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
owed what they had already paid
 
02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
they owed that again as back
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
10 years of homeowner association dues
 
02:07:45.169 --> 02:07:45.179 align:start position:0%
when they hadn't been a homeowners
 
02:07:45.179 --> 02:07:46.970 align:start position:0%
when they hadn't been a homeowners
association

02:07:46.970 --> 02:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
on and that went through the court
 
02:07:51.890 --> 02:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
system I don't think it went to the
 
02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court eventually but the
 
02:07:55.930 --> 02:07:55.940 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
and I can't quite remember what the
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
resolution was but it wasn't totally
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
satisfactory for those uh 10 other lots
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
and on what we did and what you passed
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
was to say that the Secretary of State's
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
office which they had filed with as a
 
02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
voluntary corporation on was
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was quite those words
 
02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
but uh they they had filed with on had
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
to hold a hearing
 
02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:33.649 align:start position:0%
to hold a hearing
before

02:08:33.649 --> 02:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
such a institution could be dissolved or
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
reconstituted as the same one
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that is in law now but a most places
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know about it and B on The
 
02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:54.380 align:start position:0%
Association members that were being
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
find essentially for previous years were
 
02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't know about it
 
02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:04.850 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't know about it
so

02:09:04.850 --> 02:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I only thought you could do a
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
three-year look back yeah so so that
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
a historical incident and I'm pretty
 
02:09:18.649 --> 02:09:18.659 align:start position:0%
sure there have been some others in home
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
with homeowner associations fair enough
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
but without credit well thank you for
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
contributing that
 
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
okay uh I think having no more cards but
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
we will close I will close the public
 
02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
hearing as soon as I have the blue sheet
 
02:09:48.109 --> 02:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
knowing assuming there's not much on
 
02:09:50.209 --> 02:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
there uh for the members of the
 
02:09:50.219 --> 02:09:51.109 align:start position:0%
there uh for the members of the
committee

02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I have scheduled for next week I
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's been sent out yet
 
02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
um it has been okay
 
02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
um and so what it turns out is that um
 
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
the following week uh in my in our uh if
 
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
it turns out the fishing game only has
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
one bill and uh so that means their
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee room and time is actually open
 
02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
on a Tuesday
 
02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
so um uh as I've said to you all before
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
I uh the idea of having a Friday uh day
 
02:10:25.129 --> 02:10:25.139 align:start position:0%
for the Commerce is was anathema for me
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:10:28.970 --> 02:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
um pay attention uh now to that calendar
 
02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
that Tuesdays potentially will be a day
 
02:10:35.890 --> 02:10:35.900 align:start position:0%
where we'll have hearings
 
02:10:39.649 --> 02:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
but not next week because
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
um they're sharing with three committees
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
for that committee room but
 
02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
but so anyways going forward
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so uh and more importantly
 
02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
um we have six bills that um have an
 
02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
early departure date and which means
 
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
they're going to a second committee
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and so I've got those all scheduled
 
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
for next week the hearings and then we
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
would be doing the subcommittee's work
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
on those bills uh the following week
 
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
February I think it's February 1st
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the first we'll need to get
 
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
the sub committee work we have to vote
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
on them by the 16th so I usually like to
 
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
schedule a couple of subcommittees so we
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
have plenty of opportunity to work on
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
those bills and obviously
 
02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.930 align:start position:0%
those bills and obviously
um yes

02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
the marijuana bills are one of them is a
 
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
is an early departure bill so we we need
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
to really delve into it it's 34 pages
 
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
long and um I haven't
 
02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
gotten my red pen out yet but I'm I'm
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
hoping that we will not try to try to
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
sort through a 34 page Bill uh in two
 
02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:45.109 align:start position:0%
sort through a 34 page Bill uh in two
weeks

02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so we'll see how that goes but anyway
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
just want to give you all a heads up on
 
02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.270 align:start position:0%
just want to give you all a heads up on
that

02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're adjourned and I'll see
 
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
you all back in an hour
 
02:12:03.890 --> 02:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.740 --> 03:22:06.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%

03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
doing uh the part-time work around the
 
03:22:48.170 --> 03:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
country but the bill I'm about to
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
present HB 383 this is not an
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
earth-shattering bill
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I I want to save you from from
 
03:22:58.429 --> 03:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
widespread PBM reform today
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a New Concept in fact the
 
03:23:03.050 --> 03:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature has recognized
 
03:23:06.230 --> 03:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
this issue that's presented in HB 383 as
 
03:23:08.690 --> 03:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
a relevant issue and the overall major
 
03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
tenets of 383 are already found in RSA
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
402n I see HB 383 is more of a
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
modernization of current law and it just
 
03:23:22.610 --> 03:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
closes some loopholes to make the
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
current law work a little bit more
 
03:23:26.690 --> 03:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
efficiently and make it more work as
 
03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
intended when it was first passed
 
03:23:32.929 --> 03:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to talk about it here at a
 
03:23:36.290 --> 03:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
high level uh and and and but I do have
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
some current Pharmacy owners here with
 
03:23:39.650 --> 03:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
me to get into some specifics to answer
 
03:23:40.969 --> 03:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
some of the specifics and how it
 
03:23:44.929 --> 03:23:44.939 align:start position:0%
functions uh in in real life if you will
 
03:23:47.330 --> 03:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
um who will come come up after me
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh however before I get going I do want
 
03:23:52.250 --> 03:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
to Define some terms that will be used
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
for today I think it's important I
 
03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
understand that these terms are very
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
specific to our industry and uh um and I
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
think it might be helpful to understand
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
as we as we move along so the first term
 
03:24:06.290 --> 03:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
I want to Define is a pharmacy benefit
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
manager uh you'll also hear this term
 
03:24:12.889 --> 03:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
defined as a PBM three-letter term pbms
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
are middlemen companies uh that
 
03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
insurance companies hire to carry out
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
their drug benefit the pbms in turn not
 
03:24:22.849 --> 03:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies contract with
 
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies to assemble a pharmacy
 
03:24:24.420 --> 03:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies to assemble a pharmacy
Network

03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
Network
 
03:24:29.210 --> 03:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
pbms determine which pharmacies will be
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
included in a prescription drug plans
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
Network and how much said pharmacies
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
will be paid for their services and I
 
03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
think it's important to note that three
 
03:24:42.530 --> 03:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
pbms three three individual pbms control
 
03:24:44.769 --> 03:24:44.779 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the drug benefit
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
transactions in the United States and
 
03:24:50.330 --> 03:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
all of them own their own pharmacies
 
03:24:52.130 --> 03:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
the other term that I want to discuss is
 
03:24:54.729 --> 03:24:54.739 align:start position:0%
Mac pricing Mac
 
03:24:59.210 --> 03:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
so in an effort to control costs pbms
 
03:25:02.210 --> 03:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
frequently utilize a pricing concept
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
called Mac or maximum allowable cost the
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mac is the maximum amount that a
 
03:25:12.530 --> 03:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit manager will reimburse
 
03:25:15.889 --> 03:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy for the cost of a drug this
 
03:25:18.769 --> 03:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
is a contracted agreement that the
 
03:25:21.650 --> 03:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
pharmacy will take whatever the PBM has
 
03:25:23.570 --> 03:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
decided to pay them for a particular
 
03:25:27.170 --> 03:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
drug and because drug prices fluctuate
 
03:25:29.650 --> 03:25:29.660 align:start position:0%
frequently the Mac reimbursement
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
oftentimes doesn't keep up with the drug
 
03:25:34.130 --> 03:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
prices especially in the volatile drug
 
03:25:37.250 --> 03:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
price markets we've seen lately so
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
the concept is important to understand
 
03:25:42.650 --> 03:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
especially as consumers you know being
 
03:25:44.570 --> 03:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
that Mac is a contracted agreement
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
between a pharmacy and a PBM it's not
 
03:25:49.309 --> 03:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
like going into the The Market Basket
 
03:25:51.410 --> 03:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
and seeing a dozen eggs and saying I'm
 
03:25:52.969 --> 03:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
only going to pay two dollars for this
 
03:25:54.889 --> 03:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
dozen of eggs when they're selling for
 
03:25:58.729 --> 03:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
seven they're contractually obligated to
 
03:26:01.490 --> 03:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
take whatever price that the PBM is
 
03:26:03.469 --> 03:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
telling them to pay so it's a contracted
 
03:26:05.630 --> 03:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
agreement and understanding that these
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
prices are fluctuating every day the
 
03:26:09.530 --> 03:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
other concept that we've heard a lot
 
03:26:11.389 --> 03:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
about in the news that I just want to
 
03:26:13.389 --> 03:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
write remind folks here today about is
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
transparency and as we talk about
 
03:26:18.530 --> 03:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
transparency and Drug pricing there
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
appears to be room for improvement in
 
03:26:22.969 --> 03:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
the manner in which premiums communicate
 
03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
Mac pricing and the sources of the
 
03:26:27.769 --> 03:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
products to which Mac pricing has been
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
applied unclear and opaque methodology
 
03:26:33.170 --> 03:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
is a relic of the past and we all
 
03:26:35.809 --> 03:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
understand that a hidden Market is not a
 
03:26:37.490 --> 03:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
free market
 
03:26:40.190 --> 03:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned previously that the
 
03:26:42.769 --> 03:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
concept in HB 383 is not the first time
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature has had Mac pricing in
 
03:26:47.330 --> 03:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
front of it in fact we have statutes on
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
the books dealing with this issue so
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 383 is not a radical new
 
03:26:57.250 --> 03:26:57.260 align:start position:0%
legislation in fact SB 226 of 2019
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
established that if a PBM had a maximum
 
03:27:04.190 --> 03:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
allowable cost or a Mac pricing on a
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
given drug that was below the available
 
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost for a pharmacy the PBM
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
had to provide the pharmacy with a
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
source where the drug could be obtained
 
03:27:18.889 --> 03:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
at or below the Mac price
 
03:27:21.710 --> 03:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
so that means if a pharmacy submits a
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
claim for a particular drug amoxicillin
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
and the reimbursed claim comes at below
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
the drug price that's actually costs and
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
that Mac price is below the actual
 
03:27:35.330 --> 03:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
acquisition cost that PBM has to supply
 
03:27:37.729 --> 03:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
a source to where that Pharmacy can buy
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
that drug at that lower price
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's in law already
 
03:27:47.090 --> 03:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
this bill closes a loophole HB 383 in
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
front of you closes a loophole in the
 
03:27:51.290 --> 03:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
law and it states that the PBM must
 
03:27:53.170 --> 03:27:53.180 align:start position:0%
provide the pharmacy where the what
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
wholesaler doing business in New
 
03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:56.210 align:start position:0%
wholesaler doing business in New
Hampshire

03:27:56.210 --> 03:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
where that drug is available at or below
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
that Mac price so it kind of finishes
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
the sentence of what we have in statute
 
03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:05.510 align:start position:0%
the sentence of what we have in statute
already

03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:28:08.090 --> 03:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
this bill also requires that the PBM
 
03:28:10.370 --> 03:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
notify all pharmacies in the network
 
03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
when it finds that a Mac price is below
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
acquisition costs and allows them to
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
rebuild at the more appropriate
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate
 
03:28:21.050 --> 03:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
current practice is that a PBM provides
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
a portal that a pharmacy must log into
 
03:28:27.170 --> 03:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
but given the technological advances
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
employed in modern Pharmacy this
 
03:28:31.729 --> 03:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
information can be transmitted and
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
disseminated instantly pbms can actually
 
03:28:37.130 --> 03:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
calculate prescription deductibles in
 
03:28:40.190 --> 03:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
real time they can do because they can
 
03:28:42.110 --> 03:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
do this and because that technology is
 
03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
available they certainly can communicate
 
03:28:48.889 --> 03:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
out to pharmacies when and where these
 
03:28:50.750 --> 03:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
these prices are available
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
again this is not radical reform
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm not here to prevent to
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
provide you or present to you some type
 
03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
of groundbreaking
 
03:29:04.849 --> 03:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
legislation that's uh that's gonna gonna
 
03:29:07.490 --> 03:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
rock this world
 
03:29:10.010 --> 03:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
um it just cleans up some areas that we
 
03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
found in previous legislation that we
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
feel need improving
 
03:29:15.170 --> 03:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer some general
 
03:29:16.729 --> 03:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
questions about this but like I said
 
03:29:18.530 --> 03:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
I've got I've got pharmacists here that
 
03:29:19.969 --> 03:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
have come out today that have taken time
 
03:29:22.130 --> 03:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
off of their work to answer very
 
03:29:24.290 --> 03:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
specific questions they're here to to
 
03:29:26.210 --> 03:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and how this would
 
03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
work functionally in their pharmacies
 
03:29:31.729 --> 03:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
today so if you have some questions for
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
me I'd be happy to answer them otherwise
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to turn this over to them
 
03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
but yeah I don't have any other
 
03:29:42.050 --> 03:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
cards do they do they I did I left some
 
03:29:43.790 --> 03:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
up there for you
 
03:29:43.800 --> 03:29:46.990 align:start position:0%
up there for you
um

03:29:46.990 --> 03:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
these are
 
03:29:54.170 --> 03:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.210 --> 03:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
I left them with mine I left a card and
 
03:29:57.769 --> 03:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
I left there's I told them to leave
 
03:30:00.050 --> 03:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
theirs up there too all right
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:06.889 --> 03:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
okay so uh Glenn perald yes
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.889 --> 03:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
oh someone had a question I'm sorry I
 
03:30:15.229 --> 03:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
didn't see the hand uh yes thank you yes
 
03:30:15.239 --> 03:30:16.490 align:start position:0%
didn't see the hand uh yes thank you yes
representative

03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
very briefly
 
03:30:21.769 --> 03:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
will the proposed change have any effect
 
03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
one way or the other on consumer costs
 
03:30:27.050 --> 03:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
and if so what
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
so I think any time that you improve
 
03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
transparency in pricing anytime that
 
03:30:36.130 --> 03:30:36.140 align:start position:0%
there's an effort to to make the process
 
03:30:39.229 --> 03:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh more visible whether it be to the
 
03:30:42.250 --> 03:30:42.260 align:start position:0%
pharmacies that are participating in it
 
03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
I think that there's always an
 
03:30:46.250 --> 03:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to improve cost you know the
 
03:30:48.610 --> 03:30:48.620 align:start position:0%
concern that I have when
 
03:30:51.050 --> 03:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
continuing on the process that there is
 
03:30:55.130 --> 03:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
now when pharmacies are forced to sell
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
drugs at below costs uh or because again
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
this is a contracted agreement they're
 
03:31:03.769 --> 03:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
just not going to carry the drugs and
 
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to participate in
 
03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
these programs and if you need a drug
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
and this is continually being what we
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
call macked at below cost the pharmacies
 
03:31:17.929 --> 03:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
are not going to carry the drug so you
 
03:31:20.870 --> 03:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
know it will affect it could affect cost
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
improving cost prices but it certainly
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
will affect access to care if this can
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
continues on it's my opinion
 
03:31:32.690 --> 03:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
well it's funny to say that because I
 
03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
was sitting there saying to myself
 
03:31:37.370 --> 03:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
if they're going to tell you the PBM is
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
going to tell you where you can get it
 
03:31:42.290 --> 03:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
at this low price
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
that means you didn't have it in stock
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
absolutely well with these Mac prices
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
are generally applied to multi-source
 
03:31:54.590 --> 03:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
generics so if you have amoxicillin for
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
instance which we you know use for sore
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
throats and antibiotic there might be 12
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
different companies that make
 
03:32:04.969 --> 03:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
amoxicillin so my wholesaler might sell
 
03:32:07.610 --> 03:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
six of them eight of them 10 of them but
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
if they're basing their Max Mac pricing
 
03:32:14.450 --> 03:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
on that 11th or 12th product brand that
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
my wholesaler doesn't have or or or is
 
03:32:19.969 --> 03:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
available that we don't know about we
 
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
want to know about that and so we can
 
03:32:24.530 --> 03:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
bring that product in and and and and
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
sell it at that lower price and
 
03:32:30.650 --> 03:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
therefore comply with the Mac pricing
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
right but you're you're you don't want
 
03:32:35.809 --> 03:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
to sell it below cost I get that
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
um you have your wholesaler who you used
 
03:32:41.090 --> 03:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
to using and then it turns out that
 
03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
there's somebody out there that has it
 
03:32:44.750 --> 03:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
at a lower price
 
03:32:46.910 --> 03:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
and now we have a chicken in the egg how
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying that they need to
 
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
let you know the PM needs to know let
 
03:32:54.110 --> 03:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know ahead of time we don't even
 
03:32:56.269 --> 03:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
know whether what who you're getting it
 
03:32:58.250 --> 03:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
from in the first place right
 
03:33:01.309 --> 03:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
well in in
 
03:33:03.290 --> 03:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
and I can let these guys can speak to
 
03:33:04.490 --> 03:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
that a little bit clearer because
 
03:33:05.570 --> 03:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
they're they're dealing with the
 
03:33:07.370 --> 03:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
wholesalers on a on a daily basis and
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
their contract with them and they can
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
tell you how that functionality will
 
03:33:10.680 --> 03:33:11.809 align:start position:0%
tell you how that functionality will
work

03:33:11.809 --> 03:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:33:11.819 --> 03:33:13.010 align:start position:0%
work
um

03:33:13.010 --> 03:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:14.510 --> 03:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to let them answer that
 
03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
question right so just so you know what
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
where my thought was as soon as you had
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
said oh there could be a lower price my
 
03:33:22.610 --> 03:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
first reaction is you but you're going
 
03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
to have to tell the customer I I'm not
 
03:33:26.809 --> 03:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
going to sell it to you I'm not going to
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
give it to you today because I don't
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
have it at the price point in which the
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies PPM is going to
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
reimburse me Adam but if I have it in
 
03:33:35.880 --> 03:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
reimburse me Adam but if I have it in
stock

03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
stock
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I'll let these guys comment on that
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
we have to sell it at that price we have
 
03:33:44.450 --> 03:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
the product in stock and it's on our
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
shelves and we transmit a claim for that
 
03:33:48.969 --> 03:33:48.979 align:start position:0%
that that that that that
 
03:33:52.130 --> 03:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
product right we have to sell it even if
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's below our costs so we have to sell
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
the contractually obligated to sell it
 
03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
at a loss
 
03:34:00.769 --> 03:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay well that's interesting all right
 
03:34:02.809 --> 03:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:15.410 --> 03:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Glenn peralt I'm a
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and also a pharmacy owner in
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
New London New Hampshire
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here obviously in support of
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:29.750 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.769 --> 03:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
there are several instances that come up
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
weekly that Dave was trying to describe
 
03:34:41.570 --> 03:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
where I have current stock on my
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Shelf
 
03:34:47.650 --> 03:34:47.660 align:start position:0%
and are being and being reimbursed below
 
03:34:52.490 --> 03:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
what I pay for that drug on my shelf
 
03:34:56.210 --> 03:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
I either submit a request for adjustment
 
03:34:58.370 --> 03:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
or I have a
 
03:34:58.380 --> 03:34:59.210 align:start position:0%
or I have a
um

03:34:59.210 --> 03:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
a party submit an adjustment on my
 
03:35:06.290 --> 03:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
behalf and many many many times that
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
request is unsuccessful and if it is
 
03:35:13.370 --> 03:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
successful I get a very very brief note
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
back from the PBM saying
 
03:35:19.250 --> 03:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
um that the product is available cheaper
 
03:35:21.050 --> 03:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
in the marketplace
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it
 
03:35:25.010 --> 03:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
I have no idea where to find it I have
 
03:35:28.610 --> 03:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
no idea if it's even a U.S supplier
 
03:35:32.809 --> 03:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
um like uh Mr Rochford was saying
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative roach was saying if that
 
03:35:37.490 --> 03:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
product is on my shelf I am
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
contractually obligated to sell that to
 
03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
fill that prescription and sell that
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
product even if it's at a loss

product even if it's at a loss

um process that we undergo with the pbms
 
03:36:02.330 --> 03:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
is not a negotiated process it is a take
 
03:36:05.450 --> 03:36:05.460 align:start position:0%

um unable to service around 800 patients
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
because of contracts that were offered
 
03:36:28.490 --> 03:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
to my Pharmacy
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
um seven percent below my acquisition
 
03:36:30.660 --> 03:36:32.929 align:start position:0%
um seven percent below my acquisition
cost

03:36:32.929 --> 03:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:36:32.939 --> 03:36:34.790 align:start position:0%

for my 800 patients
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
um what this bill will do is it will put
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
the onus some onus back on the PBM to
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
identify a supplier in the state of New
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that I can purchase
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
medications for to fulfill my

03:36:59.570 --> 03:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to entertain any any
 
03:36:59.580 --> 03:37:02.570 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to entertain any any
questions

03:37:02.570 --> 03:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
well that's pretty straightforward
 
03:37:09.469 --> 03:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
so and I I I have an open invitation to
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
any representative who wants to come up
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacy and just see what we do
 
03:37:16.849 --> 03:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
every day and and uh see what I'm trying
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
to explain in action
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
so they the pbms right now have no
 
03:37:25.490 --> 03:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
particular obligation to let you know
 
03:37:28.969 --> 03:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
who they want you to who to have as a
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
wholesaler that's correct
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and and there's even some
 
03:37:36.170 --> 03:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
um Mac responses that we get back where
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
the the product in question is not the
 
03:37:42.530 --> 03:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
product that I am requesting a Mac
 
03:37:45.290 --> 03:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
adjustment on uh for example
 
03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
um there may be a a a two ounce tube of
 
03:37:48.899 --> 03:37:49.910 align:start position:0%
um there may be a a a two ounce tube of
cream

03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
cream
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
that says no our Mac is fine order this
 
03:37:54.960 --> 03:37:56.090 align:start position:0%
that says no our Mac is fine order this
particular

03:37:56.090 --> 03:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
um every drug has what's called an NDC
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
number a National Drug code
 
03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
they provide me an NDC number and and
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
what I see time and time again
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
is an NDC number for a smaller pack size
 
03:38:10.490 --> 03:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
well of course that pack size is going
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
to be below your Mac for the 60 gram
 
03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
pack size this is just some of the real
 
03:38:17.690 --> 03:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
world situations that we're dealing with
 
03:38:19.849 --> 03:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacy and what we're hoping
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
that this bill will address and and
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
clean up
 
03:38:26.210 --> 03:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
good now we have questions
 
03:38:26.220 --> 03:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
good now we have questions
Representatives

03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
I know that a pharmacy has a limited
 
03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
size and shelf area and uh
 
03:38:42.170 --> 03:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
expiration dates on drugs and things
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
like that what would you say the
 
03:38:46.610 --> 03:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
percentage of drugs
 
03:38:49.490 --> 03:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
are that of what you have in your area
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
of what people want are actually
 
03:38:53.690 --> 03:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
available that
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
you would not necessarily have to go out
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
and just say all right I'll get it back
 
03:38:59.630 --> 03:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
in two days
 
03:39:03.530 --> 03:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
um so I would say that we probably fill
 
03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
between 95 and 99 of all the
 
03:39:08.929 --> 03:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that walk through the door
 
03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
um very very rarely do we have to make a
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
special order
 
03:39:16.250 --> 03:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
um for an item with our Pharmacy is a
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
very very busy Pharmacy we fill upwards
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
of of
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
um 10 000 prescriptions a month and so
 
03:39:24.670 --> 03:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
we typically have a fairly
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
substantial inventory
 
03:39:30.830 --> 03:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
so you you could be hit with this Mac
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
limitation if you will on across a lot
 
03:39:38.450 --> 03:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
of drugs so my my Mac requests
 
03:39:40.090 --> 03:39:40.100 align:start position:0%
um in my Pharmacy
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
generally there is about a dozen to a
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
dozen and a half Mac adjustment requests
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
per week
 
03:39:52.729 --> 03:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
um and I would say out of that dozen and
 
03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
a half I would say less than one are
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted I would say with out of out of
 
03:40:01.729 --> 03:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
a hundred Mac requests we probably have
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
about two
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
that actual
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
um they're actually adjusted
 
03:40:09.650 --> 03:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
and the difficult part about
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
The Adjustment and allowing us to go
 
03:40:14.990 --> 03:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
back and rebuild the claim is
 
03:40:17.150 --> 03:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
this time of year we have several people
 
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
who are meeting deductibles and so we
 
03:40:23.570 --> 03:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
transmit the prescription off and the
 
03:40:25.849 --> 03:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
patient's not paying a copay they're
 
03:40:28.190 --> 03:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
paying the full adjusted price of that
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
prescription and so now I go back two
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
three weeks later rerun the claim and it
 
03:40:38.450 --> 03:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
tells me that I oh I shouldn't charge
 
03:40:41.330 --> 03:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
the patient you know 150 I should have
 
03:40:42.530 --> 03:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
charged the patient a hundred and
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
seventy dollars well
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to call the patient I'm
 
03:40:47.990 --> 03:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
saying oh by the way you underpaid by 20
 
03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
bucks you got to come back
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult situation that we're
 
03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
put in
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks a lot
 
03:41:01.010 --> 03:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
um this pbm's company is a negotiated
 
03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
you may have said but is it negotiated
 
03:41:07.070 --> 03:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
by the insurance company
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
do they hire these people yeah it's yes
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
a PBM um so an insurance company say
 
03:41:16.130 --> 03:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
Anthem Blue Cross does not handle
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
prescription claims at all they say they
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
they will hire and I believe in anthem's
 
03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
case they hire a company called Express
 
03:41:24.889 --> 03:41:24.899 align:start position:0%
Scripts and they said you handle our
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
insurance you you do all prescriptions
 
03:41:30.290 --> 03:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
run it the way you want to run it the
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
pbn will come back and say okay you want
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
to allow 90-day 90-day prescriptions at
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
retail do you want to have a mandatory
 
03:41:40.969 --> 03:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
mail order do you they set up all the
 
03:41:42.410 --> 03:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
rules in the and the insurance company
 
03:41:44.570 --> 03:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
says yes and no and yes and no
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
03:41:48.769 --> 03:41:48.779 align:start position:0%
is offered now after all those questions
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
are answered the PBM will take that
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
contract and we'll present that to the
 
03:41:56.450 --> 03:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacy whether it's an independent
 
03:41:58.130 --> 03:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
like me or whether it's a chain store
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
they will say this is how that plan
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
works this is your reimbursement
 
03:42:05.210 --> 03:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
you can either
 
03:42:07.610 --> 03:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
choose to service these people
 
03:42:09.070 --> 03:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up
 
03:42:14.990 --> 03:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the question and
 
03:42:17.929 --> 03:42:17.939 align:start position:0%
um so how long is this issue a problem
 
03:42:20.450 --> 03:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
been exists how long has this been going
 
03:42:20.460 --> 03:42:21.769 align:start position:0%
been exists how long has this been going
on

03:42:21.769 --> 03:42:21.779 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:42:25.250 --> 03:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
so I have been a pharmacist in the state
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire since April 14th of
 
03:42:27.239 --> 03:42:28.729 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire since April 14th of
1984.

03:42:28.729 --> 03:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
1984.
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
and it's been a challenge since then
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
not to this degree
 
03:42:36.769 --> 03:42:36.779 align:start position:0%
not not until recently over the last
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
four or five years have we been seeing
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
the number of underwater claims
 
03:42:45.530 --> 03:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
at the rate it is now
 
03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
and it's to the severity it is now
 
03:42:51.650 --> 03:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I my my
 
03:42:55.190 --> 03:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
last contracts that I had to refuse
 
03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:55.910 align:start position:0%
last contracts that I had to refuse
um

03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:00.490 --> 03:43:00.500 align:start position:0%
were offered at seven percent below
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
what I could buy the drugs for and
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
speaking to some of my colleagues and
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%

03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
they don't tell you
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
have you asked them why they will not
 
03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:12.530 --> 03:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
have you ever asked them why will you
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
not tell me how you came up with fifteen
 
03:44:18.050 --> 03:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
dollars who's the wholesaler and and if
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case that they will
 
03:44:22.370 --> 03:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
not tell you then do you have any
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
confidence that they're telling you the
 
03:44:25.490 --> 03:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
truth if they won't tell you that's
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
correct we we don't
 
03:44:29.570 --> 03:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
um that these are just maybe made up
 
03:44:32.450 --> 03:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
prices well we we that's right we we
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't know and and and to this point
 
03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:36.650 align:start position:0%
don't know and and and to this point
um

03:44:36.650 --> 03:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:40.010 --> 03:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
we don't know how to proceed and
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
challenge that we know that the
 
03:44:44.889 --> 03:44:44.899 align:start position:0%
insurance commission is responsible for
 
03:44:48.290 --> 03:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
enforcing the the statutes but we don't
 
03:44:51.889 --> 03:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
know the Avenue in which to pursue and
 
03:44:53.210 --> 03:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
who to pursue at the insurance
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
commission we constantly run into
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
roadblocks with the insurance commission
 
03:44:59.570 --> 03:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce
 
03:45:05.150 --> 03:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks so I guess we want
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
to hear from the PCMS
 
03:45:15.170 --> 03:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
bcmas Curtis you guys yeah we we try to
 
03:45:17.210 --> 03:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
go back and forth
 
03:45:19.010 --> 03:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
so you're going to hear their story and
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
then you'll be able to come to respond
 
03:45:22.610 --> 03:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
to what they say
 
03:45:25.250 --> 03:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's okay I assume the two of you are
 
03:45:34.190 --> 03:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:37.729 --> 03:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank you good afternoon uh Mr
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee my name
 
03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
is Curtis Barry I'm here on behalf of
 
03:45:43.490 --> 03:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical Care Management
 
03:45:45.530 --> 03:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
Association otherwise known as pcma
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
which is the national trade Association
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the PBM industry we have several
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
members that are active here in New
 
03:45:52.969 --> 03:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with me is Sam hollimeyer from
 
03:45:56.330 --> 03:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
pcma and before I turn it over to Samba
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
for the primary testimony
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to point out I've left a
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
packet for each one of you and wanted to
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
walk through that real briefly the first
 
03:46:06.769 --> 03:46:06.779 align:start position:0%
page would look like this sort of a
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
chart that describes
 
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
the supply chain and the reimbursement
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
chain for pharmaceuticals it is fairly
 
03:46:15.889 --> 03:46:15.899 align:start position:0%
complicated and it's not like other
 
03:46:18.550 --> 03:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
medical suppliers
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
so you start with the drug makers
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the physical drugs that the
 
03:46:24.650 --> 03:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are talking about then
 
03:46:26.330 --> 03:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
transfer to a wholesaler which then
 
03:46:28.330 --> 03:46:28.340 align:start position:0%
sells to the pharmacy
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
on the other side on the right hand
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
column you have a PBM which can be
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
contracted with an insurance carrier
 
03:46:36.889 --> 03:46:36.899 align:start position:0%
some carriers do the PBM Services
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
in-house PBM can also contract with a a
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
self-insured large employer
 
03:46:47.330 --> 03:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
um and the patient is a member uh
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
through their health benefit with their
 
03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:51.050 align:start position:0%
through their health benefit with their
employer

03:46:51.050 --> 03:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:46:53.929 --> 03:46:53.939 align:start position:0%
um so their the pharmacy benefit manager
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
does exactly that it manages the
 
03:46:58.190 --> 03:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit for either the employer
 
03:47:00.889 --> 03:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
or the the insurance company importantly
 
03:47:03.889 --> 03:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
on this chart I want to point out that
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
the wholesalers have no direct
 
03:47:08.450 --> 03:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
connections to the pbms
 
03:47:09.889 --> 03:47:09.899 align:start position:0%
they buy their drugs from the
 
03:47:11.929 --> 03:47:11.939 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and sell to the pharmacy
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
we cannot any PBM cannot dictate from
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
whom a pharmacy purchases drugs and
 
03:47:19.849 --> 03:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
cannot get involved in in those
 
03:47:19.859 --> 03:47:21.349 align:start position:0%
cannot get involved in in those
negotiations

03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
in the negotiations for the purchase
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
those contracts if you look at the
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
second page typically are handled by
 
03:47:30.410 --> 03:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
what's known as a psao Sam we'll get
 
03:47:32.450 --> 03:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit more but the
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
psaos of Pharmacy Services
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
Administration organization that serves
 
03:47:39.889 --> 03:47:39.899 align:start position:0%
in part to negotiate contracts between
 
03:47:43.729 --> 03:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
pbms and pharmacies also to negotiate I
 
03:47:45.650 --> 03:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
understand between the wholesaler and
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy itself so if somebody knows
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
the information that they're looking for
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
the wholesalers know what their prices
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
are maybe we should be talking to them
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
about their pricing they're the ones
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
that are we heard testimony that are
 
03:48:00.650 --> 03:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
causing the fluctuation of the price
 
03:48:03.229 --> 03:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
that the pharmacy pays or maybe the psao
 
03:48:05.750 --> 03:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
who was involved in negotiating those uh
 
03:48:07.250 --> 03:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
those contracts
 
03:48:09.769 --> 03:48:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh the next page I've provided for you
 
03:48:12.170 --> 03:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
the the con the full
 
03:48:14.809 --> 03:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
um text of the current statute that was
 
03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
referred to previously uh and based upon
 
03:48:20.450 --> 03:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
a recent comment I want to point out
 
03:48:22.729 --> 03:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
right at the very beginning uh Roman 1
 
03:48:26.090 --> 03:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
small a all contracts between a carrier
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
or a pharmacy benefit manager and a
 
03:48:31.130 --> 03:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
contract of Pharmacy shall include the
 
03:48:32.570 --> 03:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
source is used by the pharmacy benefit
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
manager to calculate the drug product
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement paid for cover drugs under
 
03:48:38.210 --> 03:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy Health Plan
 
03:48:41.330 --> 03:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we're required to show them how the
 
03:48:43.849 --> 03:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
Mac price was achieved in essence and
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
then there are other Provisions in here
 
03:48:48.769 --> 03:48:48.779 align:start position:0%
uh related to what happens if the claim
 
03:48:51.410 --> 03:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
is denied which also requires some
 
03:48:51.420 --> 03:48:52.610 align:start position:0%
is denied which also requires some
information

03:48:52.610 --> 03:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:48:55.010 --> 03:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh there's a copy of Sam's testimony
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
here uh and then a one-pager on Mac
 
03:49:00.530 --> 03:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
pricing in general and one more point
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make for the committee's
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
information New Hampshire is what's
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
known as an any willing provider State
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
relative to Pharmacy that happened an
 
03:49:14.330 --> 03:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
awful long time ago
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
um Donnelly delozo uh we won't tell the
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
story but in essence New Hampshire
 
03:49:26.210 --> 03:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
statute for 30 or so years states that a
 
03:49:29.450 --> 03:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacy must be let into the network if
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy is willing to uh adhere to
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions that's offered
 
03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
by the insurance carrier or the PBM in
 
03:49:39.469 --> 03:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
other words the pbmo carrier cannot
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
cherry pick or just decide no we don't
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
want you in the network just because
 
03:49:44.690 --> 03:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
every Pharmacy must be led into the
 
03:49:46.969 --> 03:49:46.979 align:start position:0%
network if they're willing to adhere to
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions so with that
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like
 
03:49:52.250 --> 03:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
Sam turn it over to Sam for the
 
03:49:55.130 --> 03:49:55.140 align:start position:0%

some written testimony I do want to
 
03:50:17.570 --> 03:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
highlight exactly what Mac is again it's
 
03:50:20.030 --> 03:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
maximum allowable cost a maclist
 
03:50:22.250 --> 03:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
specifies how much a PBM will reimburse
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
any given Pharmacy on a generic drug a
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
generic can be made by several different
 
03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and sold to pharmacies at
 
03:50:31.190 --> 03:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
different price points because of this
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
PBM set and regularly update the Mac the
 
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
Mac list by surveying Market data from
 
03:50:39.710 --> 03:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized pricing reference
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
Services wholesalers as well as drug
 
03:50:44.510 --> 03:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers the purpose of a Mac list
 
03:50:46.610 --> 03:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
is to encourage encourage a pharmacy to
 
03:50:49.969 --> 03:50:49.979 align:start position:0%
purchase drugs to purchase generic drugs
 
03:50:51.410 --> 03:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
at the lowest price that they possibly
 
03:50:53.570 --> 03:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
can driving competition amongst
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and keeping costs down for
 
03:50:56.330 --> 03:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
pay patients
 
03:50:58.250 --> 03:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
pbms have no insight to the
 
03:50:59.809 --> 03:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
relationships between pharmacies and
 
03:51:01.190 --> 03:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
wholesalers so I'm going to end on that
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
now to get in the specifics of the bill
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
so section one sub B would require pbms
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
to notify the source a pharmacy can
 
03:51:10.610 --> 03:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
purchase a drug app or below the Mac
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
price there was discussions earlier on
 
03:51:14.450 --> 03:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
that the PBM would have to require to
 
03:51:16.849 --> 03:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
notify a pharmacy where that Mac price
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
came from
 
03:51:19.969 --> 03:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
but with this bill would not require
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
that a wholesale or sell it to that
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacy at that price I think that's
 
03:51:25.190 --> 03:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
what a big point is missing here that
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
these pharmacies want to know where they
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
can get that price but there's no
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the wholesaler can sell
 
03:51:33.050 --> 03:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
it to them at that price again those are
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
negotiated rates between a pharmacy a
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
psao and a wholesaler not the PBM the
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
PBM has no insight to that information
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
next is section two sub B there's a the
 
03:51:46.370 --> 03:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
phrase actual cost is in here there's no
 
03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
definition in New Hampshire statute and
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty unsure of what that
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
might mean so we had a question on what
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
actual cost was again that's section two
 
03:51:57.170 --> 03:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
sub B
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
um again section two sub B would require
 
03:52:01.250 --> 03:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
pbms to notify notify all pharmacies of
 
03:52:03.050 --> 03:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
immaculous change
 
03:52:05.210 --> 03:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
um pbms have no way of knowing if a
 
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
pharmacy purchase a drug below or above
 
03:52:10.190 --> 03:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
a Mac price unless they let us know so
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're unsure of how notifying them would
 
03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
have worked for us and then finally
 
03:52:16.610 --> 03:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
section three sub D would require that
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
pbm's Supply are Mac list to the
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department these Mac lists are
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pages long and they're
 
03:52:26.150 --> 03:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
updated frequently so it's a huge burden
 
03:52:28.429 --> 03:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
for the Department in our opinion and uh
 
03:52:30.050 --> 03:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
we already applied we already supplied
 
03:52:31.250 --> 03:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacies
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
so we would suggest a request that we
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
strike that from the bill thanks for the
 
03:52:37.309 --> 03:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today and I'm
 
03:52:41.150 --> 03:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
let me get this straight
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're going
 
03:52:49.190 --> 03:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
to say content there's a Mac price and a
 
03:52:51.050 --> 03:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
certain dollar amount from a certain
 
03:52:51.060 --> 03:52:53.269 align:start position:0%
certain dollar amount from a certain
wholesaler

03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
wholesaler
 
03:52:55.610 --> 03:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
irregardless of whether that wholesaler
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
even sells into the state of New
 
03:52:57.420 --> 03:52:58.670 align:start position:0%
even sells into the state of New
Hampshire

03:52:58.670 --> 03:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:53:00.769 --> 03:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
the data that we receive I believe is
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire and just
 
03:53:06.130 --> 03:53:06.140 align:start position:0%
markets in general in the area yes
 
03:53:10.130 --> 03:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
so would there be volume discounts there
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
certainly are but we are not aware of
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
those volume discounts provided to
 
03:53:13.439 --> 03:53:15.229 align:start position:0%
those volume discounts provided to
pharmacies

03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
you are aware of a Mac price you have a
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
price they're reported to us yes and
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
that Mac price doesn't take into
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
consideration that this was only
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
supplied to a certain large employer
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
well I'm not like erisa that it wasn't
 
03:53:34.130 --> 03:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
available even in the small group Market
 
03:53:36.650 --> 03:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
that it was that price was a negotiated
 
03:53:40.250 --> 03:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
price between a
 
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
big Corporation and that wholesaler
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
they've got that negotiated price you're
 
03:53:48.590 --> 03:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
using that as the basis but that price
 
03:53:50.450 --> 03:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
is not might not available for anybody
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
else but that Corporation
 
03:53:54.889 --> 03:53:54.899 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that answer off the top
 
03:53:56.450 --> 03:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
of my head I'd have to go back and look
 
03:53:56.460 --> 03:53:58.490 align:start position:0%
of my head I'd have to go back and look
chairman

03:53:58.490 --> 03:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:54:00.530 --> 03:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
do you follow where I'm going on this I
 
03:54:04.250 --> 03:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.090 --> 03:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
holy moly okay representative Denson
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so let me get this
 
03:54:14.450 --> 03:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
straight because I'm a little fogged in
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
the fog about this on January 1st I buy
 
03:54:21.050 --> 03:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a pharmacist and I buy
 
03:54:23.330 --> 03:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
something for ten dollars and on January
 
03:54:26.929 --> 03:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
15th it comes in and it's changed by the
 
03:54:26.939 --> 03:54:28.610 align:start position:0%
15th it comes in and it's changed by the
pbms

03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
pbms
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
dealer it's five dollars
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
is there any time between the first and
 
03:54:36.650 --> 03:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
the 15th where there's a notification
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
notification process to let them to let
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist know if it's going to go
 
03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
down or not yes the pharmacies have
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
access to a portal where they can see a
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
Mac price reimbursement in real time so
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:54.410 --> 03:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
these Mac lists are also provided to
 
03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacies regularly but yes there is a
 
03:54:58.250 --> 03:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
portable available for pharmacies to
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
view that price
 
03:55:02.150 --> 03:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you okay
 
03:55:04.130 --> 03:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
03:55:05.570 --> 03:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I'm just curious
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
following up on the representative
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
business question how often are these
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
portals updating like is this something
 
03:55:13.130 --> 03:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
that's updating every day every week
 
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
every month every year currently in
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
statute we were pbms are required to
 
03:55:19.370 --> 03:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
update it every 14 days
 
03:55:21.530 --> 03:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't know I don't know the
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
business really at all but could a
 
03:55:26.570 --> 03:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy by a certain stock of product
 
03:55:28.670 --> 03:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
and it would maybe last two months or
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
are they just buying one week's worth of
 
03:55:31.610 --> 03:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
time and so that's actually a relevant
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
amount of time I I can't answer that
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes representative gifts
 
03:55:42.889 --> 03:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:46.370 --> 03:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
can you tell us if you know if any other
 
03:55:49.490 --> 03:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
states have requirements such as those
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
provided in this bill and if they do
 
03:55:56.929 --> 03:55:56.939 align:start position:0%
if those requirements cause any problems
 
03:55:58.610 --> 03:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
question could you be more specific is
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
it the whole bill in general or is there
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
a specific portion of the bill
 
03:56:07.849 --> 03:56:07.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't be more specific this
 
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
area is very unfamiliar to me and it's a
 
03:56:14.689 --> 03:56:14.699 align:start position:0%
very complex situation
 
03:56:16.729 --> 03:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
um and you're testifying against the
 
03:56:20.150 --> 03:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill but nobody has mentioned how common
 
03:56:24.050 --> 03:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
these types of requirements are and so
 
03:56:25.370 --> 03:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's what I was asking and I was
 
03:56:27.290 --> 03:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
hoping so you know this is interesting
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
how many states have that any willing
 
03:56:31.490 --> 03:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
provider statute
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
because I remember when we had this
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
floor debate and I said to Donnelly I
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
said Donnelly
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
there could be PR the pharmacist could
 
03:56:43.370 --> 03:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
be having to just because they want to
 
03:56:45.650 --> 03:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
service the customer
 
03:56:47.929 --> 03:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
they could have to pay more because they
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the volume that another a
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
different pharmacist might have and she
 
03:56:55.969 --> 03:56:55.979 align:start position:0%
said the pharmacists were just want to
 
03:57:00.830 --> 03:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
that was what the floor debate was
 
03:57:05.090 --> 03:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
for any willing provider specifically
 
03:57:06.349 --> 03:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'll get you that information I don't
 
03:57:07.610 --> 03:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
know that but I think that's what it was
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
the debate around the any willing
 
03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
provider issue
 
03:57:12.769 --> 03:57:12.779 align:start position:0%
um sorry could I go back to my question
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
yes so what your question is is that any
 
03:57:16.849 --> 03:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
other states other states have this
 
03:57:19.010 --> 03:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
problem and the answer would be is how
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
many other states have the any willing
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
provider statute uh no I'm afraid not
 
03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a transparency requirements
 
03:57:33.610 --> 03:57:33.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
requirements proposed I understand that
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have the Annie willing provider
 
03:57:42.969 --> 03:57:42.979 align:start position:0%
statute but this bill then goes to
 
03:57:45.469 --> 03:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
transparency requirements as I
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
03:57:49.729 --> 03:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
and what I'm asking is do other are
 
03:57:51.889 --> 03:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
there other states that have these
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
transparency requirements and if there
 
03:57:54.479 --> 03:57:55.309 align:start position:0%
transparency requirements and if there
are

03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:57:58.250 --> 03:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
do those requirements cause any problems
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information readily
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
readily available representative but I'd
 
03:58:03.650 --> 03:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
be happy to look into it and follow up
 
03:58:06.769 --> 03:58:06.779 align:start position:0%
with that information thank you
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so just so everybody
 
03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
understands what does any willing
 
03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
provider statue is about it was about
 
03:58:16.250 --> 03:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
that theoretically if you want your
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
volume you want to get the best price
 
03:58:21.410 --> 03:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
from your pharmacy from the farm for
 
03:58:24.050 --> 03:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
your Pharmaceuticals the generally the
 
03:58:26.330 --> 03:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
the insurance company is going to
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
exterior you to the mail order company
 
03:58:33.410 --> 03:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
that I I would say that we won't see a
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
mail order company in here with this
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
complaint because they know exactly what
 
03:58:39.889 --> 03:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
they're going to get reimbursed because
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's a negotiated price between the
 
03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
PBM and that mail order company what
 
03:58:47.809 --> 03:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with here is is we're
 
03:58:50.570 --> 03:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
dealing with independent pharmacists
 
03:58:53.870 --> 03:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
who are the customers going to them
 
03:58:56.389 --> 03:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to get it in the
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
mail they want to deal with a local
 
03:59:01.370 --> 03:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
person and the problem then is is that
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
the pbms do not have individual uh
 
03:59:07.969 --> 03:59:07.979 align:start position:0%
contracted pricing they just have this
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
agreement that they will reimburse
 
03:59:15.769 --> 03:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:15.779 --> 03:59:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:20.689 --> 03:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
chairman uh if I understand this
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
correctly with the pbms you say you
 
03:59:30.290 --> 03:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
update through the portal every 14 days
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
or so
 
03:59:34.330 --> 03:59:34.340 align:start position:0%
so there's potentially
 
03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of possible price changes is
 
03:59:39.309 --> 03:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:59:41.450 --> 03:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head how
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
often or how frequently individual ndcs
 
03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
are updated but again it's all on
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
generic drugs I would think you you
 
03:59:50.210 --> 03:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
would have the you know the experience
 
03:59:52.490 --> 03:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
to answer that I would think I would
 
03:59:54.769 --> 03:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
hope right again if I may I want to come
 
03:59:56.410 --> 03:59:56.420 align:start position:0%
back to the relationship
 
04:00:00.170 --> 04:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
that exists in this sort of the the
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
reimbursement Arena
 
04:00:06.290 --> 04:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
um we the PBM has no control zero over
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
how much the wholesalers ask for their
 
04:00:10.969 --> 04:00:10.979 align:start position:0%
drugs how often they increase those
 
04:00:10.979 --> 04:00:11.750 align:start position:0%
drugs how often they increase those
prices

04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
prices
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
Etc and one of the uh Concepts behind
 
04:00:18.650 --> 04:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
Mac pricing is not necessarily to
 
04:00:20.689 --> 04:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
reimburse for actual cost because if we
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
were if PBM was required to do that
 
04:00:24.650 --> 04:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
there would be no incentive for the
 
04:00:26.450 --> 04:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
wholesaler to keep their costs down they
 
04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
could raise prices to whatever price
 
04:00:30.889 --> 04:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
they wanted and the PBM is then required
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
to pay those prices and at the end of
 
04:00:35.150 --> 04:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
the day it's the premium payers then who
 
04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
would face the increased cost for the
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
question being Claire yes thank you I
 
04:00:41.689 --> 04:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up so
 
04:00:45.050 --> 04:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
just for example on Amazon Amazon knows
 
04:00:47.090 --> 04:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
all when I buy things and it says hey
 
04:00:48.769 --> 04:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
this has been something you've bought
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
and here's a price change so in this
 
04:00:54.889 --> 04:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
industry is there any type of data that
 
04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
can provide the pharmacists the pharmacy
 
04:01:02.570 --> 04:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
owners that okay this is the the data on
 
04:01:05.330 --> 04:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
this particular drug that it's been
 
04:01:08.929 --> 04:01:08.939 align:start position:0%
going down down down down so be aware is
 
04:01:10.729 --> 04:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
there any type of you know notification
 
04:01:10.739 --> 04:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
there any type of you know notification
process

04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
or data involved as to trending trending
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
data that show that can provide them
 
04:01:21.769 --> 04:01:21.779 align:start position:0%
with a heads up in the future so like I
 
04:01:23.090 --> 04:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously there is a portal
 
04:01:24.889 --> 04:01:24.899 align:start position:0%
that pharmacies can take a look at to
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
see what the current MAC reimbursement
 
04:01:27.889 --> 04:01:27.899 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
as far as a trend going down like your
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
question is in that negotiated
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
contracted rate my response would be
 
04:01:39.769 --> 04:01:39.779 align:start position:0%
that's between the the psao which was
 
04:01:42.530 --> 04:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously and the PBM as well
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
as the pharmacy as well so they would
 
04:01:47.210 --> 04:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
have to go back and renegotiate the con
 
04:01:49.610 --> 04:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
that con contracted rate
 
04:01:52.250 --> 04:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to update that price I I
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
hope I'm answering your question
 
04:01:53.399 --> 04:01:56.510 align:start position:0%
hope I'm answering your question
correctly

04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.290 --> 04:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
so so you're not supposed to admit that
 
04:02:02.809 --> 04:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
as far as again the Mac price reflects
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
what the current market trend is so if
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
the trend is going down or up the Mac
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you thank you Steve you
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.849 --> 04:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
am I on yep my name is Steve cavadias I
 
04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
am also a pharmacist and I am also a
 
04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
pharmacy owner in Penacook
 
04:02:37.130 --> 04:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh I find all these and questions very
 
04:02:37.140 --> 04:02:38.330 align:start position:0%
uh I find all these and questions very
intriguing

04:02:38.330 --> 04:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
intriguing
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
and I I do have my own response to all
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
of them but I I can't remember them all
 
04:02:46.849 --> 04:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
but I would like to respond to your
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
question at the very beginning if this
 
04:02:52.490 --> 04:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
was going to increase the cost
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the statute the
 
04:02:57.650 --> 04:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
statute already says that they're
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to reimburse us at or above
 
04:03:00.540 --> 04:03:01.849 align:start position:0%
supposed to reimburse us at or above
cost

04:03:01.849 --> 04:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:03:03.910 --> 04:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for anything different
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're just asking for you to tell us
 
04:03:09.650 --> 04:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
where we can get that so there's
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
basically three primary wholesalers just
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
like there are three primary pbms that
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
are all involved with supplying the PBM
 
04:03:21.170 --> 04:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
owned pharmacies
 
04:03:23.929 --> 04:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
that are that the pharmacies use for
 
04:03:23.939 --> 04:03:25.130 align:start position:0%
that are that the pharmacies use for
secondaries

04:03:25.130 --> 04:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
secondaries
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
they also have their own pharmacies mail
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
order so so the concept of pbms not
 
04:03:34.130 --> 04:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
knowing the price of a drug whoever
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
asked that
 
04:03:38.570 --> 04:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
is beyond my comprehension
 
04:03:41.210 --> 04:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how they know that and or
 
04:03:43.490 --> 04:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
don't know that in addition to that with
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
the the the the way they come up with
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
the mac and they're they're checking all
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
these resources
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
well then why are they below cost and
 
04:03:55.790 --> 04:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really matter the statute
 
04:03:57.290 --> 04:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
says it's above cost and we're just
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
asking for well where is that when they
 
04:04:03.530 --> 04:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
say that it's cumbersome that that they
 
04:04:07.010 --> 04:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
cannot provide us this detail daily on
 
04:04:10.010 --> 04:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
hundreds of claims I get this person can
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
no longer get refills it has to go to
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
mail order this person can no longer get
 
04:04:16.130 --> 04:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
this product it has to be that product I
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
get all sorts of messages not one
 
04:04:22.849 --> 04:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
says Oh Let's help you find a place that
 
04:04:24.170 --> 04:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
can keep you in business because
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
although I enjoy taking care of people I
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
also have to pay my staff
 
04:04:29.040 --> 04:04:30.410 align:start position:0%
also have to pay my staff
so

04:04:30.410 --> 04:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:33.530 --> 04:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions we can I tried to
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.809 --> 04:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
you're fine Representative Vincent
 
04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I I don't want
 
04:04:49.610 --> 04:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
so you says they changed these prices
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
every 14
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
but what happens if you have a big
 
04:04:59.150 --> 04:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
demand for four months on ABC medication
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
and then you stock up on the first of a
 
04:05:05.570 --> 04:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
month and then hold on and then
 
04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
you got if you got 20 cases of a
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
medication but you have 10 left and then
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
they change the price
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
you're stuck with that pricing now you
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
lose correct correct
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you well and I can take this even
 
04:05:20.830 --> 04:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
further there is a PBM
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
that makes it an an auditable offense if
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
I buy a a product in bulk outside of the
 
04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
30-day window of the claim
 
04:05:36.530 --> 04:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
so now I'm restricted on negotiating for
 
04:05:38.210 --> 04:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
a better price
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
oh one more quick follow-up Mr chairman
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
very fast so we've looked at it going
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
down has it ever gone the other way and
 
04:05:49.969 --> 04:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
gone up I I can't I yes there are there
 
04:05:53.090 --> 04:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
are success stories of Mac changes
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh I have noticed recently that I lose
 
04:05:58.729 --> 04:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
Less on epinephrine injections or
 
04:05:58.739 --> 04:06:00.490 align:start position:0%
Less on epinephrine injections or
epipens

04:06:00.490 --> 04:06:00.500 align:start position:0%
epipens
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you and some of these losses are
 
04:06:04.490 --> 04:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
in the hundreds of dollars we're not
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:14.279 --> 04:06:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
04:06:19.370 --> 04:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
knowing how small pharmacies work being
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
a primary care provider I wrote a lot of
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for the pharmacy where we
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
worked at our hrsa but I wrote a lot of
 
04:06:28.370 --> 04:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
prescriptions for my homeless patients
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
for small pharmacies because the prices
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
were very often lower
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
my question to you is some of the things
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
that impacted us was that we didn't have
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
enough staff to be able to look up those
 
04:06:40.080 --> 04:06:41.030 align:start position:0%
enough staff to be able to look up those
sites

04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
sites
 
04:06:42.889 --> 04:06:42.899 align:start position:0%
we had a person that was working that
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
was able to do that for our Corporation
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
every day
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
um in the setting of a small Pharmacy
 
04:06:50.330 --> 04:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
can you give me an idea of what the
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
impact would be labor-wise having to
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
look up all that data well just to give
 
04:06:54.479 --> 04:06:55.490 align:start position:0%
look up all that data well just to give
you

04:06:55.490 --> 04:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
um an answer to how we manage that and
 
04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
maybe this will answer your question a
 
04:07:01.130 --> 04:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
is that we use our psao which thank you
 
04:07:06.530 --> 04:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
for telling me what the the abbreviation
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
meant because I didn't know
 
04:07:13.610 --> 04:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
um to do uh research and to
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
um to challenge these Mac prices
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
and so I I call my psao yesterday and
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
asked them some just some silly numbers
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
on on what this looks like so from the
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
time of December 16th to January 16th
 
04:07:35.410 --> 04:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
2926 appeals I believe
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
generally I asked them what is the
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
success rate and they say generally it's
 
04:07:46.729 --> 04:07:46.739 align:start position:0%
around five percent but last year it was
 
04:07:48.610 --> 04:07:48.620 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
04:07:53.290 --> 04:07:53.300 align:start position:0%
okay so when I look at the the
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
PBM that were on that list predominantly
 
04:07:59.090 --> 04:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's one of the bigger ones
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
and when I look at the top
 
04:08:02.640 --> 04:08:03.550 align:start position:0%
and when I look at the top
um

04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh a successful appeals in this past
 
04:08:10.250 --> 04:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
week it was only one PBM which of course
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
was a different one uh and and it's very
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
limited as as to the number
 
04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
so yes there are people working on this
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
on our behalf am I able to fill out a
 
04:08:29.330 --> 04:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
request based on a claim no it's hard
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
enough to do a prior authorization that
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everybody in this room is aware
 
04:08:35.689 --> 04:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
of that you need something and of course
 
04:08:38.450 --> 04:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
everybody has to jump through hoops
 
04:08:41.689 --> 04:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
um so there are there are ways of
 
04:08:44.150 --> 04:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
getting around this but I I cannot do it
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know we have so many requirements
 
04:08:49.250 --> 04:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
and laws and regulations that we have to
 
04:08:49.260 --> 04:08:50.389 align:start position:0%
and laws and regulations that we have to
follow

04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
and we do it without issue whereas we
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
have a law here that's already in effect
 
04:08:59.330 --> 04:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
and we have to beg to ask them to to to
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
please follow it and in the spirit of
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
all working together will tell us where
 
04:09:07.490 --> 04:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
where we can get this from don't make me
 
04:09:09.729 --> 04:09:09.739 align:start position:0%
go through the hundreds of of
 
04:09:12.410 --> 04:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
wholesalers to figure out where I can
 
04:09:14.809 --> 04:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
buy this and then restrict me afterwards
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that the new game
 
04:09:18.650 --> 04:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
that we have playing is that they're
 
04:09:21.130 --> 04:09:21.140 align:start position:0%
requiring specific
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturers for some generics that I I
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
can't even get or I can't get on
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
contract which violates a whole bunch of
 
04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
other contracts that I'm dealing with
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
to I think to that really gets to the
 
04:09:39.889 --> 04:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
problem here is that is the pricing is
 
04:09:42.290 --> 04:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
based on a negotiated contract and like
 
04:09:43.729 --> 04:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
I say it could have been a you know in
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
one employer Arisa they got that volume
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
discount and to apply it to every
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
business relationship that you have is
 
04:09:52.620 --> 04:09:54.349 align:start position:0%
business relationship that you have is
impossible

04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
um and so you know that I I'm not sure
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
how we can fix this problem because
 
04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
that's the nature of what pbms do is
 
04:10:05.150 --> 04:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
negotiate pricing and and so to
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate to you know as we all know if
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
you're if you're buying a hundred buying
 
04:10:11.809 --> 04:10:11.819 align:start position:0%
a case of something you're going to get
 
04:10:13.729 --> 04:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
a different price than if you're only
 
04:10:16.370 --> 04:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
buying one of it or small of it so if
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
you only have one particular uh client
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's in your community who needs this
 
04:10:24.969 --> 04:10:24.979 align:start position:0%
one obscure drug
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
and and insists on not getting it
 
04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
through the mail order but insist on
 
04:10:31.729 --> 04:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
buying it from you that you run this
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
risk of having to well that's one thing
 
04:10:36.170 --> 04:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
I have law that says that they have to
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
reimburse me above my cost
 
04:10:40.729 --> 04:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
they have to reimburse you that's what
 
04:10:41.750 --> 04:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
it says here
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
already the current law correct we're
 
04:10:46.490 --> 04:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
just asking to know where
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh where how to enforce it well no
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's another issue where no you
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to buy it where you have to know
 
04:10:55.490 --> 04:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
where to buy it from right but but they
 
04:10:57.370 --> 04:10:57.380 align:start position:0%
don't yeah
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
do they really know that that they that
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
that's the only way you can get that
 
04:11:05.689 --> 04:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
price is you got to buy a case of it not
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
just one of it but I'm not allowed to
 
04:11:11.210 --> 04:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
buy a case of it with another PBM right
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
because that violates that contract
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
right that's like I'm saying so it's
 
04:11:17.210 --> 04:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it it really is a challenge
 
04:11:19.849 --> 04:11:19.859 align:start position:0%
between a rock and a hard place here
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
well all they do is tell me where they
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
where I can buy it
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think you can obviously no
 
04:11:27.410 --> 04:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
no they they think they can say you can
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
buy it but the reality is even if you
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
were to call that wholesaler who had it
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
they say well that's fine but you got to
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
buy a case of it to get that price
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
in other words they're not factoring in
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
volume discount
 
04:11:40.620 --> 04:11:43.189 align:start position:0%
volume discount
no

04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.370 --> 04:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
well we do we are involved in buying
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
groups where we negotiate the best
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
prices that we can right it's not just
 
04:11:54.530 --> 04:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
me with my small store and Glenn with
 
04:11:57.290 --> 04:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
his larger store because you guys are
 
04:11:58.969 --> 04:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
not a writer you're all Independents
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
right correct correct Independence our
 
04:12:04.370 --> 04:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions our prices are very similar
 
04:12:07.370 --> 04:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
except for a little bit of volume
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
difference and pricing but but not
 
04:12:13.250 --> 04:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
significantly different
 
04:12:16.130 --> 04:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and and as I grow based on the need
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
occurring which is where this is where
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is you know I get those
 
04:12:23.570 --> 04:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
discounts but my losses continue to grow
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
as my business grows because of
 
04:12:32.090 --> 04:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
of some some silly little issues of you
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
know this is what we say the cost is
 
04:12:38.689 --> 04:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
we have determined that this is what the
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
cost is
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
we can look at some sort of compendium
 
04:12:45.410 --> 04:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
and do a discount off of that price to
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
come up with what Mac is
 
04:12:53.330 --> 04:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
they buy tons of drugs and know what the
 
04:12:54.769 --> 04:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
prices are
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
well well tell me well what okay what
 
04:12:59.809 --> 04:12:59.819 align:start position:0%
manufacture them that I can go to and
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
say okay you need to give me the same
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
price because
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we're just asking for
 
04:13:07.560 --> 04:13:09.170 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we're just asking for
information

04:13:09.170 --> 04:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:13:12.530 --> 04:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
you know and and and not part of this is
 
04:13:14.210 --> 04:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
is the next step is trying to figure out
 
04:13:15.769 --> 04:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
how do we get
 
04:13:18.110 --> 04:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
the state to enforce
 
04:13:21.050 --> 04:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
them to provide us
 
04:13:23.809 --> 04:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
oh at cost or above I'm not sure how
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
many people here are business owners or
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
have budgets but but selling things at
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
below costs is not a very good business
 
04:13:32.520 --> 04:13:33.650 align:start position:0%
below costs is not a very good business
plan

04:13:33.650 --> 04:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:13:35.330 --> 04:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
I mean I
 
04:13:37.250 --> 04:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know I only went to a couple schools
 
04:13:38.689 --> 04:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
well you theoretically you could say to
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
the customer I'm sorry I can't sell it
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
to you because I'm not going to get
 
04:13:44.290 --> 04:13:44.300 align:start position:0%
reimbursed enough well the point is
 
04:13:47.769 --> 04:13:47.779 align:start position:0%
that we're being forced down this road
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
of well how do we how do we stay alive
 
04:13:53.330 --> 04:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the numbers I mean
 
04:13:55.010 --> 04:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's not like Independents are growing
 
04:13:57.410 --> 04:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
every day pharmacies are closing I mean
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
even the chains are closing I got it I'm
 
04:14:02.809 --> 04:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
sorry okay representative Terry has one
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
more question so
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the Chairman's astute observation
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding but alongside and coming
 
04:14:13.250 --> 04:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
back to the response given to me by one
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the previous folks who was testifying
 
04:14:18.769 --> 04:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
the other Pharmacy owner
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
the question here is the problem is they
 
04:14:23.929 --> 04:14:23.939 align:start position:0%
won't tell you where you can get it
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
correct right now you never get the
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
feeling that what they would like is for
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
you to just go away
 
04:14:33.170 --> 04:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
and disappear well I think so everything
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
can be bail ordered that is for sure
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
correct okay let's just cut to the chase
 
04:14:44.050 --> 04:14:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:48.050 --> 04:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert has a
 
04:14:48.060 --> 04:14:48.769 align:start position:0%
okay representative Herbert has a
question

04:14:48.769 --> 04:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry he's he's right-handed
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
04:14:57.650 --> 04:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
I just want to I think what we're
 
04:15:00.790 --> 04:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
looking at is a very complicated uh
 
04:15:04.010 --> 04:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
semi-monopoly system which really isn't
 
04:15:06.010 --> 04:15:06.020 align:start position:0%
in competition
 
04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
and uh my question is is there a a
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
source that does in fact
 
04:15:18.370 --> 04:15:18.380 align:start position:0%
uh is such a large buyer of drugs that
 
04:15:22.610 --> 04:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
they get the best price the market will
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
well the the people there is there a
 
04:15:29.090 --> 04:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
source that buys that much yes so we buy
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
from the three largest wholesalers in
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
the country I used to buy from the
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
largest distrib distributor of generic
 
04:15:40.370 --> 04:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
drugs in the world
 
04:15:42.590 --> 04:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
okay so I would think
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
that their pricing would be pretty good
 
04:15:48.849 --> 04:15:48.859 align:start position:0%
yeah I was part of their uh organization
 
04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
through a um
 
04:15:55.849 --> 04:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.859 --> 04:15:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
franchise

04:15:58.309 --> 04:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
who was this that was McKesson McKesson
 
04:16:03.410 --> 04:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay and drug companies well well
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're a wholesaler
 
04:16:09.170 --> 04:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
and they also are psao
 
04:16:11.450 --> 04:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
that negotiate the prices for us and yes
 
04:16:13.849 --> 04:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
there is a there there's a cloud of
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
mystery there that why is it that are
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
you signing contracts when you know
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's not what you know the prices are
 
04:16:23.450 --> 04:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
higher you know there's many layers to
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
this onion we're just trying to find out
 
04:16:25.199 --> 04:16:26.269 align:start position:0%
this onion we're just trying to find out
where

04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:16:28.969 --> 04:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
they think we can get this
 
04:16:30.769 --> 04:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
um my further question but we're not
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
buying it from a a little wholesaler
 
04:16:35.570 --> 04:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
down the road that can't compete with
 
04:16:38.570 --> 04:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
big guys I'm competing with
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
the I'm using the same Distribution
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
Systems I'm using the same Source the
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
same Supply channels except going direct
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturers which is probably
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
what the mail orders are doing
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
just one further question further
 
04:16:51.359 --> 04:16:52.309 align:start position:0%
just one further question further
question

04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:52.319 --> 04:16:53.389 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
perchance does the federal government is
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
are they a customer
 
04:16:57.359 --> 04:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
are they a customer
yes

04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
it's called Medicare pardon me Medicare
 
04:17:05.929 --> 04:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
Medicare okay Medicare well we they also
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people in defense that uh
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
not on Medicare yet but correct well we
 
04:17:13.610 --> 04:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
have the state who's a very large
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
employer I'm just trying to get I'm just
 
04:17:19.070 --> 04:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
trying to identify where you may be able
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
to get the information on not just a
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
need to know basis but a portal that
 
04:17:25.319 --> 04:17:26.210 align:start position:0%
need to know basis but a portal that
shows

04:17:26.210 --> 04:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
shows
 
04:17:30.050 --> 04:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
all the pricing that's secret that well
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's the secret no the Dirty
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
Little Secret is not that anybody likes
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
each other there's that the whole point
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
of a negotiated price is that it's a
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated secret and so yes you're
 
04:17:42.050 --> 04:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you're basically asking the
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
PBM to tell us their special formula of
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
what website special price they got with
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
that one particular manufacturer and
 
04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
they don't want to tell you that can I
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
throw out a silly analogy that I thought
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
about this morning sure
 
04:17:58.010 --> 04:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
so the regulation states that they have
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
to pay us
 
04:18:02.450 --> 04:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
cost or better
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
now I have a lot of regulations that I
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
when I drive
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
there is nobody
 
04:18:11.150 --> 04:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
standing by the side of the road that
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
says stop the speed limit is going to
 
04:18:13.560 --> 04:18:14.570 align:start position:0%
says stop the speed limit is going to
change

04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:18:17.090 --> 04:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
look it up
 
04:18:19.490 --> 04:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
figure out what it is because down the
 
04:18:21.170 --> 04:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
road there's going to be somebody that's
 
04:18:23.450 --> 04:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
going to you know bag you if you're not
 
04:18:23.460 --> 04:18:24.290 align:start position:0%
going to you know bag you if you're not
right

04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
let's not put a sign up
 
04:18:28.969 --> 04:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna tell you and if you're
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
in a hurry you just blow by the guy
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to go you're not going
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
to know why is it that we all have to
 
04:18:37.250 --> 04:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
follow the rules
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
and here we have a proprietary situation
 
04:18:41.570 --> 04:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
that has to be secret and we have to
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
make it all convoluted and and and and
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have to jump through hoops to make
 
04:18:50.210 --> 04:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
sure that they are complying with the
 
04:18:50.220 --> 04:18:51.050 align:start position:0%
sure that they are complying with the
rules

04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
I think I think you look at an
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
Anti-Trust issue so well let's add a
 
04:18:56.929 --> 04:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
whole nother layer would you believe
 
04:19:02.570 --> 04:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:04.969 --> 04:19:04.979 align:start position:0%
I think I think we got this one thank
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
you so much oh you're welcome you did
 
04:19:07.969 --> 04:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
good job and I would be more than happy
 
04:19:10.130 --> 04:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions in the future we
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
will be having a subcommittee on this
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay having no more cards I will
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
on 383 and let's move right on to the
 
04:19:23.330 --> 04:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay next up uh house bill 426.
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
relative to regulations of Pharmacists
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
in charge and pharmacies you know it's
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.720 --> 04:19:48.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:19:48.370 --> 04:19:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee you're going to
 
04:20:00.050 --> 04:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
get all kinds of Pharmacy today
 
04:20:03.250 --> 04:20:03.260 align:start position:0%
but I promise you I won't be back
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
somehow I think I could be scheduled for
 
04:20:07.610 --> 04:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
another day I think you do yeah we'll
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
get this out of your way this one is
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
this the easy one this should be easy I
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
thought there was an easy one this
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
should be easy this should be easy I see
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of pink cards though so I think
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
that they should be all easy pick cards
 
04:20:18.420 --> 04:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
that they should be all easy pick cards
um

04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:24.410 --> 04:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
so before you right now is HB 426 so
 
04:20:28.010 --> 04:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
this bill actually was put forward as a
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
request from the Board of Pharmacy so in
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
addition to being a pharmacist I also am
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
vice president of the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
so the Board of Pharmacy has been
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
working since this summer
 
04:20:37.760 --> 04:20:39.610 align:start position:0%
working since this summer
to

04:20:39.610 --> 04:20:39.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
modernize some of our our Pharmacy
 
04:20:49.130 --> 04:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
Practice Act to delineate how a permit
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
is issued and I know this typically
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
isn't doesn't
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
isn't business
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
um but it does relate to how a business
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
in pharmacy
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
is granted a permit so right now the way
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
it stands in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
and RSA 318 when the permit is issued to
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy is actually issued to a
 
04:21:15.410 --> 04:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in charge or a pharmacist in
 
04:21:19.490 --> 04:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
charge is the one who actually is is uh
 
04:21:22.490 --> 04:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
um the the permit is issued to now the
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
concept of a pharmacist in charge goes
 
04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
way back to when most pharmacies were
 
04:21:31.490 --> 04:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
owned by Pharmacists and the state had
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
to have somebody to go to and hold
 
04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
responsible if there was an issue
 
04:21:41.330 --> 04:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
and uh so the issues that would arise
 
04:21:45.050 --> 04:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
that a pharmacist in charge would be
 
04:21:48.410 --> 04:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
responsible for could be as mundane as
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's hot and cold
 
04:21:51.769 --> 04:21:51.779 align:start position:0%
running water whether or not there was
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
adequate Staffing whether or not the
 
04:21:56.210 --> 04:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
roof leaked whether or not the door had
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
a lock on it whether or not the sign had
 
04:22:01.010 --> 04:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
letters that were three inches tall I
 
04:22:02.210 --> 04:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
mean that's the kind of stuff that's in
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy Practice Act I mean it's
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's it gets to be that mundane
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
the problem is you you get fast forward
 
04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
to the year 2023 and most pharmacies in
 
04:22:16.729 --> 04:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as we learn
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
about just a few minutes ago are not
 
04:22:21.530 --> 04:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
owned by individuals anymore they're
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
owned by corporations or by hospitals so
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
to have an individual pharmacist in
 
04:22:29.090 --> 04:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
charge be responsible for making sure
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
there's hot and cold running water when
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
many times that person has no authority
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
to call a plumber and hire a roofer or
 
04:22:40.969 --> 04:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
or call a locksmith this is just a
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
modernization of that so the Board of
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy asked to put this bill forward
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
and what this does is it delineates a it
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
takes out of the pharmacist in charge
 
04:22:55.490 --> 04:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
and it puts in a permit holder so
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
what we've done now is where their
 
04:23:00.170 --> 04:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
pharmacists in charge was responsible
 
04:23:02.450 --> 04:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
for certain activities and certain
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we've Rewritten the
 
04:23:06.889 --> 04:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
bill Rewritten 318 and put that
 
04:23:08.990 --> 04:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility under the permit holder
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
which essentially would be the owner or
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
that designated person within the bill
 
04:23:14.040 --> 04:23:15.950 align:start position:0%
that designated person within the bill
um

04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
this has come again this this has been
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
when we put this bill together we
 
04:23:23.689 --> 04:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
brought in a number of stakeholders this
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
has been supported like I said by the
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy I think
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from the New
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pharmacists Association or at
 
04:23:30.530 --> 04:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
least they've signed in New Hampshire
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association the chain
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
pharmacists uh have supported the CVS
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
has supported this this has been run by
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
um some of the folks down on Amazon it's
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
a wildly supported concept it's a it's a
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
modern concept uh and it's one that I
 
04:23:48.769 --> 04:23:48.779 align:start position:0%
think reflects uh the the current state
 
04:23:50.590 --> 04:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
in in the times so with that I would be
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that the
 
04:24:01.010 --> 04:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
so this this bill probably should have
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
gone to Edna and normally would have
 
04:24:07.250 --> 04:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
gone to Edna but I think that they had
 
04:24:09.530 --> 04:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
so many bills and they knew we were
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing Pharmacy bills so you guys love
 
04:24:13.849 --> 04:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy do we just we're getting a
 
04:24:14.929 --> 04:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
little more boned up on the pharmacy
 
04:24:18.170 --> 04:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
sure so but I don't think we have any
 
04:24:19.969 --> 04:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
particular questions right it's very
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward thank you good job
 
04:24:21.960 --> 04:24:23.229 align:start position:0%
straightforward thank you good job
okay

04:24:23.229 --> 04:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:29.450 --> 04:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh next is uh let's see do I have I have
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
I don't have any oh Gary Merchant
 
04:24:40.189 --> 04:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony which I won't
 
04:24:44.809 --> 04:24:44.819 align:start position:0%

04:24:46.610 --> 04:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
pleasure sometime this evening or some

other time I also have a
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony from an attorney who's
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
also a pharmacist Richard Burdette I'm
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill as well hold on
 
04:25:09.170 --> 04:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.050 --> 04:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Merchant
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a representative represented in
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
Claremont and Croydon which is Sullivan
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
County District 6.
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
prior to serving in the house I served
 
04:25:23.210 --> 04:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
on a New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
along with representative roachford for
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
a period of time
 
04:25:30.050 --> 04:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
of the 10 years the last two was serving
 
04:25:32.210 --> 04:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
as the president of the board
 
04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
this is really a simple
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
simple bill I'll just get it down to the
 
04:25:39.050 --> 04:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.570 --> 04:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
we need to find a way to align
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
accountability with authority
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
he who has the authority should be
 
04:25:46.080 --> 04:25:47.990 align:start position:0%
he who has the authority should be
accountable

04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
as representative protrude said
 
04:25:53.330 --> 04:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's a relic from the past
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
back in the 50s and 60s when a lot of
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
this came about
 
04:25:59.689 --> 04:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
the owner of the pharmacy
 
04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
was most likely the pick
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
so you had alignment between Authority
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and responsibility and accountability
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
however over the years
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
as independent pharmacies were acquired
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
as Corporate America expanded locations
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
that alignment has been eroded to the
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
point today where the pharmacists in
 
04:26:26.809 --> 04:26:26.819 align:start position:0%
charge still retains all the
 
04:26:28.490 --> 04:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
accountability to the board
 
04:26:32.450 --> 04:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
with extremely little if any Authority
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
they don't decide on the Staffing they
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
don't decide about the drugs what's
 
04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
stored in the pharmacy they really have
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
very little authority outside of showing
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
up to work and doing what they're
 
04:26:45.170 --> 04:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
04:26:47.330 --> 04:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example which is what
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
prompted a lot of this
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
we had a clap a case here in New
 
04:26:54.170 --> 04:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which a pharmacist in charge
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
in a hospital
 
04:26:57.649 --> 04:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
was held accountable
 
04:26:59.570 --> 04:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
04:26:59.580 --> 04:27:00.889 align:start position:0%
makes sense
however

04:27:00.889 --> 04:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:27:03.790 --> 04:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
we have documentation that they sent
 
04:27:06.889 --> 04:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
requests to senior leadership asking for
 
04:27:06.899 --> 04:27:08.809 align:start position:0%
requests to senior leadership asking for
resources

04:27:08.809 --> 04:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
so the issue that arose would not arise
 
04:27:14.570 --> 04:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
they were not supplied with the
 
04:27:14.580 --> 04:27:15.769 align:start position:0%
they were not supplied with the
resources

04:27:15.769 --> 04:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
but the way the law is written
 
04:27:21.469 --> 04:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
there is no Authority by the board
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
to hold a permit holder accountable
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
because they don't have accountability
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
they only have authority
 
04:27:30.050 --> 04:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
so what this bill fundamentally does
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
it goes back to aligning accountability
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
with responsibility
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
number two if you look at the statute
 
04:27:37.439 --> 04:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
number two if you look at the statute
today

04:27:38.630 --> 04:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist in charge is not only
 
04:27:43.370 --> 04:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
accountable for themselves
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're accountable
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
for all the pharmacists working within
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy
 
04:27:51.769 --> 04:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
why would one pharmacist be accountable
 
04:27:53.510 --> 04:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
over another pharmacist how they
 
04:27:53.520 --> 04:27:54.469 align:start position:0%
over another pharmacist how they
practice

04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't hold a position accountable
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
for another position
 
04:27:59.510 --> 04:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't hurt hold the nurse
 
04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
accountable for what another nurse does
 
04:28:04.490 --> 04:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
so why do we do that with Pharmacy
 
04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
so all I'm asking in support of the bill
 
04:28:10.250 --> 04:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
is for you both to think how do we align
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
fundamentally if you have the authority
 
04:28:15.769 --> 04:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
you have the accountability
 
04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll see about my testimony written
 
04:28:22.250 --> 04:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.990 --> 04:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
nice seeing you
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
okay do we have any questions I think
 
04:28:39.469 --> 04:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward this is
 
04:28:39.479 --> 04:28:41.269 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward this is
brain

04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
brain
 
04:28:44.530 --> 04:28:44.540 align:start position:0%
statute up to up to the current times
 
04:28:47.210 --> 04:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you very much uh Kathy
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
from the hospital Association so nice to
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
see you again nice to see you
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
04:29:04.849 --> 04:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Kathy Bazar
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
with thunderberg I'm the Executive Vice
 
04:29:07.490 --> 04:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
President New Hampshire Hospital
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
Association we represent all 26 acute
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
care hospitals in all specialty
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire
 
04:29:17.090 --> 04:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
we are in full support of House Bill 426
 
04:29:19.490 --> 04:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
and as already mentioned the the
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
alignment between a permit holder and
 
04:29:24.170 --> 04:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
allowing licensees to focus on their
 
04:29:26.210 --> 04:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
scope of practice is really the the Crux
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
um under the current statutory framework
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
all responsibilities of a pharmacy are
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
assigned uh to a pharmacy to a
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in charge which includes the
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
operations their own scope of practice
 
04:29:40.610 --> 04:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
and those that work in the pharmacy many
 
04:29:42.410 --> 04:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
times as already stated by
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford and Merchant
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
those operational decisions about how to
 
04:29:48.410 --> 04:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
run a pharmacy are made at a different
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
level not themselves and but
 
04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Board of Pharmacy
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
holds the pick solely responsible for
 
04:29:57.229 --> 04:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
everything we truly believe that
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
properly aligning Pharmacy operations as
 
04:30:01.610 --> 04:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the permit holder
 
04:30:03.490 --> 04:30:03.500 align:start position:0%
and allowing the individual
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
professionals to be responsible for
 
04:30:07.490 --> 04:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
their own actions and their scope of
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
practice is the most appropriate way to
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
structure Pharmacy and Pharmacy
 
04:30:13.490 --> 04:30:13.500 align:start position:0%

hi thank you good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:30:39.769 --> 04:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
Bob therio I'm the legislative chair of
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Society of Health
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
Systems pharmacists so we're a
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
professional organization that supports
 
04:30:51.769 --> 04:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
uh the professional interests of
 
04:30:53.450 --> 04:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists in all practice settings
 
04:30:56.050 --> 04:30:56.060 align:start position:0%
hospitals Community Pharmacy
 
04:30:59.689 --> 04:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
and Clinics and I'm here to support
 
04:31:03.410 --> 04:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
house bills 426. I think uh their
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rose Shredder Merchant
 
04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
and Kathy have framed uh the issue well
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh the pick language I've been a
 
04:31:15.290 --> 04:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
pharmacist for over 40 years and the
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
pick language was around when I became a
 
04:31:21.050 --> 04:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and so it is decades old and
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
archaic most pharmacies are either
 
04:31:28.490 --> 04:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
managed or owned by a district or
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
Regional or corporate level and and and
 
04:31:35.210 --> 04:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
most of the picks do not report to a
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacist I'm actually also the
 
04:31:40.849 --> 04:31:40.859 align:start position:0%
director of Pharmacy and a pick at
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
Wentworth Douglas hospital and I report
 
04:31:45.530 --> 04:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
to a chief nursing officer in our
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
hospital as part of a larger enterprise
 
04:31:50.889 --> 04:31:50.899 align:start position:0%
system so oftentimes decisions are made
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
outside of even our our Hospital scope
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
so as you can see the decision making
 
04:32:00.889 --> 04:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
and my authority and responsibility is
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um broad ranging and I don't always have
 
04:32:07.370 --> 04:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
the control that that I have as uh there
 
04:32:09.769 --> 04:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
was a case as a representative Merchant
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned of a controlled substance uh
 
04:32:14.030 --> 04:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
issue in the in the state of New
 
04:32:15.649 --> 04:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that pharmacist in charge
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
was held accountable and what came out
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
in part was the organization had not
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
renewed a contract for diversion
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring software and again that
 
04:32:30.490 --> 04:32:30.500 align:start position:0%
pharmacist was held accountable for that
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're
 
04:32:32.699 --> 04:32:33.229 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're
um

04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
aware of chapter 797 where sterile
 
04:32:40.070 --> 04:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
compounding most sterile compounding has
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
to be done in clean rooms clean rooms
 
04:32:46.250 --> 04:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
require large sums of money for hvacs
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
and to build a clean room can be in the
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
million money for hvacs and to build a
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
clean room can be in the millions of
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and if I violate a clean room uh
 
04:33:00.050 --> 04:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
statute it's my livelihood so bottom
 
04:33:03.170 --> 04:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
line and I think what this bill does is
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
put the employer employee relationship
 
04:33:09.890 --> 04:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
in line puts the accountability for the
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
permit holder where it should be and the
 
04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
accountability for my license where it
 
04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
should be so in essence I could lose my
 
04:33:19.369 --> 04:33:19.379 align:start position:0%
livelihood to be practiced as a
 
04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
pharmacist if I violated a pick or if my
 
04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
organization violated a pick
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%

um I'd like to spend a little bit of
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
time uh introducing the bill introducing

04:35:38.570 --> 04:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:35:40.490 --> 04:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I've been a practicing physician in
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
um for roughly 33 years I started my
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
career at Easter Seals I moved on to
 
04:35:49.310 --> 04:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
Concord Orthopedics my specialty is
 
04:35:51.289 --> 04:35:51.299 align:start position:0%
physical medicine and rehabilitation I
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
work with people with complex
 
04:35:52.561 --> 04:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
work with people with complex
disabilities

04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:35:54.240 --> 04:35:55.189 align:start position:0%
disabilities
um

04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
um all the disabilities I deal with
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
involve some element of pain so I become
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
a pain management specialist somewhat by
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
default somewhat by Design
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
um about 30 years ago I realized that we
 
04:36:11.570 --> 04:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
as a society don't treat these people
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
very well we stigmatize them and so I
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
became involved in advocacy first for
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
people with post-concussive syndrome
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
and then people with chronic pain and
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's been my passion for the last 30
 
04:36:26.929 --> 04:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
years as part of that I initiated and
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
helped write the first opioid
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
prescribing rules for the state I
 
04:36:33.769 --> 04:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
actually helped create the first the
 
04:36:36.490 --> 04:36:36.500 align:start position:0%
acupuncture practice act as well
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
I also
 
04:36:41.090 --> 04:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
um started two non-profits both devoted
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
to increasing access to therapies and
 
04:36:45.769 --> 04:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
and supporting the needs of people in
 
04:36:45.779 --> 04:36:46.570 align:start position:0%
and supporting the needs of people in
pain

04:36:46.570 --> 04:36:46.580 align:start position:0%
pain
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
about seven years ago I was asked by the
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
NFL players Association to chair their
 
04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
pain management committee and I've done
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
that for that period of time and I'm one
 
04:36:57.051 --> 04:36:57.061 align:start position:0%
of the lead authors on their best
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
practices guide for how we manage pain
 
04:37:03.170 --> 04:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
most importantly out of frustration I
 
04:37:04.970 --> 04:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
wrote a book called needless suffering
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
how Society fails those with chronic
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
pain it was published seven years ago
 
04:37:11.330 --> 04:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
and it's one of those yeah dub books
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
that basically tells us what we're doing
 
04:37:15.289 --> 04:37:15.299 align:start position:0%
right what we're doing wrong and how
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
through creative public policy we can do
 
04:37:19.849 --> 04:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
a lot better to help the people
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
um in need and basically it's because of
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
needless suffering that I wrote this
 
04:37:24.180 --> 04:37:25.131 align:start position:0%
needless suffering that I wrote this
bill

04:37:25.131 --> 04:37:25.141 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:37:27.529 --> 04:37:27.539 align:start position:0%
um and I would be lying if I told you
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
um that I alone wrote this bill it's a
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
um if you look on page two you list all
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
the organizations that sponsor this bill
 
04:37:39.529 --> 04:37:39.539 align:start position:0%
um I'm involved with most of these the
 
04:37:41.631 --> 04:37:41.641 align:start position:0%
one I want to draw your attention to is
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
the alliance to advance comprehensive
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
integrative pain management
 
04:37:47.990 --> 04:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
um that's a group out of Kansas City and
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
they represent over 92 National
 
04:37:52.250 --> 04:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
organizations including Health Care
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
Providers patient advocacy groups the
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense the VA and believe
 
04:37:59.570 --> 04:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
it or not insurers as well
 
04:37:59.580 --> 04:38:00.170 align:start position:0%
it or not insurers as well
um

04:38:00.170 --> 04:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:03.410 --> 04:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
we've understood since we in this
 
04:38:05.929 --> 04:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
country have understood since the 1980s
 
04:38:08.689 --> 04:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
the pain management is best done in a
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
multimodal integrative manner what that
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
means is that somebody's running the
 
04:38:16.010 --> 04:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
show and that we we provide a variety of
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
modalities simultaneously to help
 
04:38:20.410 --> 04:38:20.420 align:start position:0%
maximize outcome and Pain Management
 
04:38:23.209 --> 04:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
if you believe in eastern philosophy
 
04:38:25.970 --> 04:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
which I do that is written as far as 220
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
BC it would be wonderful if that's what
 
04:38:31.609 --> 04:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
we do but it's not what we do basically
 
04:38:34.250 --> 04:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
what we do in our culture is we pay for
 
04:38:36.949 --> 04:38:36.959 align:start position:0%
pills and procedures and and because of
 
04:38:39.170 --> 04:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
that that's what we provide patients and
 
04:38:41.929 --> 04:38:41.939 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not a very good way
 
04:38:43.609 --> 04:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
of going about things there's nothing
 
04:38:45.609 --> 04:38:45.619 align:start position:0%
integrative about it
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
none of these modalities really is shown
 
04:38:51.051 --> 04:38:51.061 align:start position:0%
any long-term benefit and it's a huge
 
04:38:54.529 --> 04:38:54.539 align:start position:0%
problem because in my world humbly and
 
04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat grandiosely I see my role as
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
standing up for the rights of 66 million
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
Americans who suffer from chronic pain
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
1.5 million people are in Hospice at any
 
04:39:07.689 --> 04:39:07.699 align:start position:0%
point in their life
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
the tens of millions of people that
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
suffer moderate to severe acute pain and
 
04:39:15.289 --> 04:39:15.299 align:start position:0%
also there's about 50 million post-op
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
patients per year all these people
 
04:39:18.890 --> 04:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
require some element of pain management
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that we're doing a
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
very good job with that so the system's
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
not working
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
and as of 2011 The Institute of medicine
 
04:39:30.890 --> 04:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
came up with a number that we quote over
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
and over again it's probably a lot
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
higher now but that costs our society
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
and loss productivity medical costs Etc
 
04:39:39.770 --> 04:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
650 million dollars a year so the point
 
04:39:42.250 --> 04:39:42.260 align:start position:0%
is what that we really need to do better
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
and what we've created for ourselves are
 
04:39:47.930 --> 04:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
a number of crises number one we have a
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
crises in over opioid prescription we
 
04:39:53.330 --> 04:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
simultaneously have a crisis in under
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
opioid prescription we have an epidemic
 
04:39:59.570 --> 04:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
of costly procedures we have a crisis of
 
04:40:01.630 --> 04:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
costly inefficient Health Care
 
04:40:03.890 --> 04:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
particularly those who suffer from
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
complex disabilities we have a crisis
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
dependency and lack of individual
 
04:40:11.448 --> 04:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
empowerment and that was a big issue in
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
our committee of Health and Human
 
04:40:14.510 --> 04:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
Services the other day trying to fix
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
that problem it also fuels the mental
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
health crises the likelihood a person
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
with chronic pain will successfully
 
04:40:23.810 --> 04:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
commit suicide is three times that of
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
the normal population Nation
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
nobody seems to care about that and that
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
really bothers me a lot it's something
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
that's really important seventy percent
 
04:40:34.730 --> 04:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
of people with chronic pain will have
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
comorbid depression and other and
 
04:40:39.050 --> 04:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorders and other things that
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
are very treatable that we don't treat
 
04:40:43.310 --> 04:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't help them with to address
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
these issues I'm going to read from all
 
04:40:48.770 --> 04:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.810 --> 04:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
to address these issues the Center for
 
04:40:53.208 --> 04:40:53.218 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and the health and human
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
separately created best practices guide
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
for pain management the CDC guide on
 
04:41:02.810 --> 04:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
opioid prescribing came out in 2016 was
 
04:41:05.630 --> 04:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
revised a couple months ago the HHS
 
04:41:09.530 --> 04:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
guide came out um in 2019 I was honored
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
to be part of all of those um
 
04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
um mostly with commentary
 
04:41:16.490 --> 04:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
um but the big thing that came out of
 
04:41:18.890 --> 04:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
these is yeah opioids have value but we
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
need to watch them but also that we need
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
to increase access to a variety of
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
therapies that we refer to as
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies including manual
 
04:41:29.570 --> 04:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
therapies restorative therapies which
 
04:41:32.530 --> 04:41:32.540 align:start position:0%
means exercise of some sort
 
04:41:36.650 --> 04:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Physical Therapy we neglect
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
the psychologic aspects of managing pain
 
04:41:41.208 --> 04:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
way too often and they're extremely
 
04:41:43.010 --> 04:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
critical in managing people with
 
04:41:45.050 --> 04:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
depression how to reform the way they
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
look at their pain things like that
 
04:41:51.530 --> 04:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
also Eastern forms of exercise are
 
04:41:53.448 --> 04:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
really amazing like I had a 90 year old
 
04:41:55.490 --> 04:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
lady come in to see me today that all I
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
needed to do to improve her balance was
 
04:41:59.690 --> 04:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
to get her in a Tai Chi program and
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
something very simple like that and and
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
we don't do that and so what happens we
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
give her Gabapentin she gets dizzy she
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
falls and now she's got a broken hip and
 
04:42:10.250 --> 04:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
a year later she's dead I mean that's
 
04:42:12.530 --> 04:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
just totally not exciting acceptable but
 
04:42:14.810 --> 04:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
that is the way we manage pain
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go over the details of
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
HB 303 I'll leave that up to you but
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say this is what it
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
does do and I'm going to say again this
 
04:42:26.448 --> 04:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
is a collaborative effort with a lot of
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
people all over the country I'm not that
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
legislatively smart these people are
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
much smarter than I am and we worked on
 
04:42:34.730 --> 04:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
this together which is really exciting
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
and these are people from all different
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
disciplines but what it does is
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
increases access to a broad array of
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
cost-effective evidence-based therapies
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
provided by licensed practitioners and
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
we've already went over the different
 
04:42:49.610 --> 04:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
modalities involved it empowers
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
individuals which is incredibly
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
important with the skills that they need
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
to control their lives it gives the
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
potential which is really important to
 
04:42:59.570 --> 04:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
prevent chronic pain because right now
 
04:43:01.490 --> 04:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
we cannot do that and we do not do that
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
and we do not do a good job of that
 
04:43:06.170 --> 04:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
also we've had a lot of discussions with
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
insurers about this issue and they're
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
exciting I really like talking to them
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
I've learned an awful lot about their
 
04:43:13.970 --> 04:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
side of the world but it creates some
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
level of transparency because what
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
they'll say is a lot of these services
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
are offered and I don't disagree with
 
04:43:20.690 --> 04:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
that but they're not offered in a
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
transparent way we the providers don't
 
04:43:25.010 --> 04:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
see that like if they have this
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
insurance what can I do for this person
 
04:43:28.850 --> 04:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
that person or the other person and that
 
04:43:31.490 --> 04:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
transparency issue is critical it
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
transitions away from expensive pills
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
and procedures that have limited
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
efficacy and you're listening to a
 
04:43:38.090 --> 04:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
hypocrite say this because I am an
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
Interventional pain specialist
 
04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
God bless me everyone it does not
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
eliminate allopathic therapies they
 
04:43:46.730 --> 04:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
still have their value but they need to
 
04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
be part of whole person care
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
so as a part of the comprehensive
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
addiction recovery Act of 2016 the VA
 
04:43:57.530 --> 04:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
was charged to create a charter program
 
04:43:59.690 --> 04:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
that would look at this to see can this
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
work and I just talked to Ben kligler
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
from the VA today to get their outcome
 
04:44:06.410 --> 04:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
data on that to make sure that I wasn't
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
missing something and Ben told me and
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
it's also published data so you can see
 
04:44:13.010 --> 04:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
this number one the people in their
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
program that provided access to these
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
services and when I did visit the VA
 
04:44:18.890 --> 04:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
here in Manchester they do have access
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
to Chiropractic acupuncture mindfulness
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
meditation all that stuff they found out
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's a 38 percent reduction in opioid
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
use and while I think some people need
 
04:44:32.448 --> 04:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
opioids every patient I've ever been on
 
04:44:34.610 --> 04:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
who has on them would rather not be on
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
them so it gave them an alternative
 
04:44:40.250 --> 04:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
strategy to manage their pain 30 percent
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in Interventional stuff that's
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
where you save the money if I'm not
 
04:44:46.730 --> 04:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
doing a thirty five hundred dollar
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
injection and this person can manage
 
04:44:50.810 --> 04:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
their pain without relying me that's
 
04:44:52.490 --> 04:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
what I want I want to go out of business
 
04:44:54.288 --> 04:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
that would be the best for me I know
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're a Commerce Committee and you're
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to promote business I want to
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
go out of business
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
less anxiety depression less medication
 
04:45:04.010 --> 04:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
use especially interestingly for psych
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
meds and improved quality of life
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
what I want to close by saying I want to
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
share a story I run a non-profit we're
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
looking at a whole life whole person
 
04:45:15.288 --> 04:45:15.298 align:start position:0%
approach to athletic perform or
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
participation pain is a huge issue that
 
04:45:21.050 --> 04:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
we deal with I did a focus group with a
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
bunch of NFL players who are on um
 
04:45:26.270 --> 04:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
uninjured reserve and the first question
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
we asked them which I already knew the
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
name of the answer to was do you trust
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
your doctor
 
04:45:34.850 --> 04:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
and the answer was an expletive no very
 
04:45:37.310 --> 04:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
loud and then the one guy looked at me
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
he was 20 years four years old said I
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't trust any doctor and it wasn't
 
04:45:44.090 --> 04:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
based on just him it was his family
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
experience dealing with pain and other
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
related issues and the re and then I
 
04:45:50.270 --> 04:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
said him I go why is that he goes
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
because all they're interested in is
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
giving me a pill or a procedure that I
 
04:45:55.490 --> 04:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
know isn't going to help me
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
and and they're more interested in their
 
04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
bottom line than they are in me
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
and then I looked at Milan what what do
 
04:46:04.730 --> 04:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
you do and then without being um at all
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna brag a little bit here but
 
04:46:08.810 --> 04:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
anyways without prompting at all he
 
04:46:11.208 --> 04:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
basically outlined hb303 all the
 
04:46:13.128 --> 04:46:13.138 align:start position:0%
modalities that he uses to manage his
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
pain he is an NFL player getting access
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
to care is not an issue but I've talked
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
to retired players where we did focus
 
04:46:22.970 --> 04:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
groups as well and they said it's a
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
shock when they leave that locker room
 
04:46:26.330 --> 04:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
for the last time and find out that they
 
04:46:27.948 --> 04:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
don't have access to these things that
 
04:46:29.810 --> 04:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
they've relied on their entire career to
 
04:46:29.820 --> 04:46:31.788 align:start position:0%
they've relied on their entire career to
function

04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
function
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
um this is an opportunity for us we have
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
been charged by patients families
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
providers governments agencies Etc to
 
04:46:40.750 --> 04:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
provide responsible
 
04:46:42.170 --> 04:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
patient-centered integrative
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary cost effective
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
broad-based care that's a run-on
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
sentence for those who suffer and who
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
too needlessly from chronic pain
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was developed in collaboration
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
with thoughtful mindful people who I'm
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
honored to represent many of whom are
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
here behind me today
 
04:47:01.080 --> 04:47:03.430 align:start position:0%
here behind me today
um

04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned if the HHS or
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
and the CDC have anything to do with it
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
we as providers are ready for this and
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
we would really like the insurers to
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
assist us in that process and I'll be
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:25.250 --> 04:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.530 --> 04:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
04:47:31.010 --> 04:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
this this one is
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
to get an opinion first of all it seems
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
like we're attacking the problem kind of
 
04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
like from the bottom instead of from the
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
top and as a result of that since so
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
many people in my age group
 
04:47:47.448 --> 04:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say yours but it is
 
04:47:47.458 --> 04:47:48.288 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say yours but it is
mine

04:47:48.288 --> 04:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
mine
 
04:47:51.050 --> 04:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
we might be closer than you think we're
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
not going to get any help out of
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
but just not you know so whatever laws
 
04:47:57.650 --> 04:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
we pass here
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
it people in my age group and on we're
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
not going to get anything from it
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
the second but my question then is this
 
04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
you mentioned licensed practitioners yes
 
04:48:10.190 --> 04:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
so I looked that up
 
04:48:12.650 --> 04:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:48:14.448 --> 04:48:14.458 align:start position:0%
the practitioners that you talk about
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
yoga uh chidung and a few other things
 
04:48:20.208 --> 04:48:20.218 align:start position:0%
they are not licensed that is somewhat
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
correct but this is how I would qualify
 
04:48:22.500 --> 04:48:23.690 align:start position:0%
correct but this is how I would qualify
that

04:48:23.690 --> 04:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
um I would take yoga out of this that
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
was kind of shouldn't have been in there
 
04:48:29.810 --> 04:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
okay the nice thing about yoga though is
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's available to anybody but I will
 
04:48:34.970 --> 04:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
tell you I I did talk to a Hindu yoga
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
master I don't know what they officially
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
call themselves and I asked them what
 
04:48:40.010 --> 04:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
kind of yoga do you recommend for back
 
04:48:42.650 --> 04:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
pain and he said I don't
 
04:48:44.810 --> 04:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
um we have a really strange idea of what
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
yoga is in the United States um it's not
 
04:48:49.010 --> 04:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
really what they think of in Hindu
 
04:48:51.650 --> 04:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
culture some of the movement patterns
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
really aren't good for those type of
 
04:48:55.490 --> 04:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
people but we've modified it a lot but
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
you can go online there's all sorts of
 
04:48:59.448 --> 04:48:59.458 align:start position:0%
access to it it's not a big deal to
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
access yoga Tai Chi maybe but um Qigong
 
04:49:05.090 --> 04:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
and things like that almost all the
 
04:49:06.890 --> 04:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
people I've known that do Qigong were
 
04:49:08.810 --> 04:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
instructed by acupuncturists who are
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
licensed and they would do that as a
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
part of their thing the acupuncturists
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
are but they themselves are not anybody
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
can hang a shingle out there and say I'm
 
04:49:17.690 --> 04:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
going to teach this stuff oh the state
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire say that again State of
 
04:49:21.770 --> 04:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you don't need a license
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
or a certification of any kind oh you're
 
04:49:27.530 --> 04:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
correct you're correct acupuncture you
 
04:49:29.690 --> 04:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
certainly do I thought that's what you
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
were saying I'm sorry no chidan you
 
04:49:33.410 --> 04:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
don't Tai Chi you don't and yoga you
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't that's where I'm having a little
 
04:49:37.970 --> 04:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
bit of a problem trying to as a as a
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
customer said say finding someone
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
legitimate and how would an insurance
 
04:49:44.690 --> 04:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
company find someone legitimate because
 
04:49:46.570 --> 04:49:46.580 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
supplying these people I could respond
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
to that in another way
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
um when we designed this bill I've been
 
04:49:54.770 --> 04:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
involved with insurers and talking about
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
this for a long time and I realize we're
 
04:49:58.368 --> 04:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
very much on different sides of this
 
04:50:00.610 --> 04:50:00.620 align:start position:0%
issue but I do think it's important
 
04:50:02.930 --> 04:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
societally to come together on these
 
04:50:05.090 --> 04:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
issues so I will say that this is a
 
04:50:07.250 --> 04:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
compromise bill it's nowhere's near what
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
I would like but it is what I know what
 
04:50:14.570 --> 04:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
what other states
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
I assume this is model legislation
 
04:50:21.170 --> 04:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's just being presented um Cindy
 
04:50:22.970 --> 04:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
Steinberg from the U.S Payne Foundation
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill with me and she
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
wrote a similar somewhat similar
 
04:50:29.090 --> 04:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
legislation in Massachusetts there's
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
other bills in other states there's a
 
04:50:32.810 --> 04:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
project going on in Vermont right now
 
04:50:36.288 --> 04:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
that the alliance advance and the VA is
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
very much involved in creating models of
 
04:50:41.570 --> 04:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
care like that I will tell you I I um
 
04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
I've been here for 33 years I've always
 
04:50:45.410 --> 04:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
believed in integrative care whether it
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
was handling stroke spinal cord injury
 
04:50:50.448 --> 04:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
pain whatever
 
04:50:50.458 --> 04:50:51.470 align:start position:0%
pain whatever
um

04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
when um when I started out we actually
 
04:50:58.430 --> 04:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
created this model by ourselves with no
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
oversight what I would what I mean
 
04:51:02.090 --> 04:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
there's no umbrella organization we
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
didn't call ourselves God's Gift of pain
 
04:51:05.208 --> 04:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
management or something we didn't have a
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
name we just did it and so what what
 
04:51:10.550 --> 04:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
I've tried to do is to replicate that
 
04:51:12.770 --> 04:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
model and I'm really frustrated by
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
barriers getting in our ways well this
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hospital doesn't want to work with that
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
hospital without private insurer it's a
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
crazy system you know if we're gonna
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
have a market-based system we need to
 
04:51:24.650 --> 04:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
have barriers that don't exist that we
 
04:51:27.650 --> 04:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
can collaborate with each other and part
 
04:51:29.570 --> 04:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
of this bill is also to break down those
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
you uh am I allowed to answer her other
 
04:51:40.570 --> 04:51:40.580 align:start position:0%
question that she comment of course okay
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't see I can't read that
 
04:51:47.150 --> 04:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
um we do have a talk our Healthcare is
 
04:51:53.930 --> 04:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
wrong it's it's it's a pyramid like that
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
read my book there's an entire chapter
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
on redoing the entire Health Care system
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
that focuses on management of problems
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
not proceduralizing it fragmentation is
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
a huge problem in our Health Care system
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
and it's because we're like that not
 
04:52:08.810 --> 04:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:52:12.410 --> 04:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative representative
 
04:52:14.208 --> 04:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
Sullivan sure go ahead
 
04:52:16.010 --> 04:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh yeah I just
 
04:52:18.170 --> 04:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
have one quick question which is if we
 
04:52:21.050 --> 04:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
already paid for a lot of these so at
 
04:52:22.010 --> 04:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
least some of these things that we pay
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
for like physical therapy and
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
chiropractor care that's generally
 
04:52:26.448 --> 04:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
considered normal normally covered by
 
04:52:28.970 --> 04:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
insurance companies so
 
04:52:31.810 --> 04:52:31.820 align:start position:0%
why what is the resistance to it now
 
04:52:34.368 --> 04:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
specifically if if what you say is true
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
that that um they could save money like
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
you said you could get this done for
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
whatever versus a 3 500 shot seems like
 
04:52:43.070 --> 04:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer so there's got to be a good
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
reason why we haven't moved to in this
 
04:52:47.150 --> 04:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
direction organically I think I would
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
have to defer that question of the
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
insurers I think I mean you you all know
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
I sat down and made a Venn diagram about
 
04:52:57.650 --> 04:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
our entire Health Care System about how
 
04:52:59.448 --> 04:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
all these little pieces fit into each
 
04:53:01.490 --> 04:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
other because there's a staying for
 
04:53:03.410 --> 04:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
every complex problem social problem
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's a solution that's neat simple
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
and wrong so I was trying to figure out
 
04:53:08.690 --> 04:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
like how all these things fit together
 
04:53:10.490 --> 04:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
and answer that question there's no
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
simple answer to that which is
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunate one of the things that I've
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
observed in all the years that I've been
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
here number one is 30 years ago when we
 
04:53:19.550 --> 04:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to communicate we actually picked
 
04:53:21.050 --> 04:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
up a telephone we don't do that anymore
 
04:53:24.050 --> 04:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
but which is a huge problem in medicine
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
because we don't communicate anymore but
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is that when we
 
04:53:31.010 --> 04:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
started out chiropractors would be
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
allowed to have almost an unendable
 
04:53:36.050 --> 04:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
number of visits with people and then
 
04:53:38.448 --> 04:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
then it was 20 visits then it was 12
 
04:53:40.730 --> 04:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
visits then some insurers at six visits
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
and other visits none then others you
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
need to have prior authorization that
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
will allow you five visits but after
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
five you have to submit another thing
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
and then when you do that at extend
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
extensive cost then you find out three
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
months later you've been approved to do
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
some more and by that time anything you
 
04:53:57.470 --> 04:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
started with is lost and I had to deal
 
04:54:00.288 --> 04:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
with that issue with acupuncture it it's
 
04:54:02.570 --> 04:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
not a good system and
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
and the crazy thing that we had talked
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
about earlier today is increa we don't
 
04:54:08.990 --> 04:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
pay for psych Service as well I think we
 
04:54:10.490 --> 04:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
all know that mental health in the
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
States and it's not just the New
 
04:54:13.550 --> 04:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's all the countries a
 
04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
problem access to care all these things
 
04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
are important um 20 visits is really
 
04:54:18.420 --> 04:54:20.090 align:start position:0%
are important um 20 visits is really
nothing

04:54:20.090 --> 04:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:54:21.410 --> 04:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you can answer it I'd be happy to
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
hear that was a very long answer for an
 
04:54:27.670 --> 04:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
so we will have a subcommittee and uh
 
04:54:33.288 --> 04:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
yes I can tell you why when we do the
 
04:54:36.650 --> 04:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay representative spear
 
04:54:38.448 --> 04:54:38.458 align:start position:0%
we touched on it but we didn't really
 
04:54:40.250 --> 04:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
but you didn't answer it and maybe you
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer but there were
 
04:54:42.240 --> 04:54:43.910 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer but there were
three

04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the yoga that uh chi dung and the Tai
 
04:54:51.770 --> 04:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
Chi are not licensed so how would even I
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
asking you as a personal question how
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
would I even find somebody since I don't
 
04:54:59.330 --> 04:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
know who's qualified and anybody can
 
04:55:02.270 --> 04:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
hang up a shingle I mean I tend to have
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
my little network of referral people
 
04:55:05.930 --> 04:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
that I trust
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
um but you're right I mean even an
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist I mean you can go to the
 
04:55:11.570 --> 04:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
board of licensure this or a doctor even
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
for that matter this I might trust some
 
04:55:15.530 --> 04:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
I don't trust but that's certainly true
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah with it but then I have a recourse
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
with these other folks I don't and so
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how you would expect an
 
04:55:25.128 --> 04:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
04:55:28.128 --> 04:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide them
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
um my answer to what would they go to
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah my answer is that those things
 
04:55:33.530 --> 04:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
should not have been in that bill so I
 
04:55:35.090 --> 04:55:35.100 align:start position:0%
would probably amend it to take those
 
04:55:35.100 --> 04:55:38.770 align:start position:0%
would probably amend it to take those
out

04:55:38.770 --> 04:55:38.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah in an Ideal World I would we have
 
04:55:44.448 --> 04:55:44.458 align:start position:0%
the same issue with personal trainers
 
04:55:46.490 --> 04:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
um exercise and restorative care is
 
04:55:48.590 --> 04:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
really important it's probably the most
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
important of anything in this bill we
 
04:55:52.910 --> 04:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
didn't include personal trainers because
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's no licensure and to be honest
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
for the same reason those three things
 
04:55:58.550 --> 04:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
should not have been in there for that
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
same reason
 
04:56:01.490 --> 04:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
but it's had that build in the past
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
what's that we've had that bill in the
 
04:56:06.610 --> 04:56:06.620 align:start position:0%
past yeah for personal trainers yes
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed that we've had that
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
legislation to mandate uh Health a third
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
party insurance reimbursement for for
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
personal trainers well for uh athletic
 
04:56:19.730 --> 04:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
trainers yeah is that some interest
 
04:56:21.288 --> 04:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
04:56:25.550 --> 04:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh I just have a
 
04:56:29.208 --> 04:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
question for of clarification on page
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh what page is this is one bill of the
 
04:56:35.930 --> 04:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
Bill of the bill yeah
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:56:45.050 --> 04:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
go ahead and say my video doesn't have
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
the lines on it no it doesn't it's so
 
04:56:49.010 --> 04:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's uh Roman numeral two under section
 
04:56:49.020 --> 04:56:50.510 align:start position:0%
it's uh Roman numeral two under section
one

04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:56:53.930 --> 04:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
um but it says uh
 
04:56:57.170 --> 04:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
shall provide for at least 20 visits and
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
shall include coverage for coordination
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
of Pain Management Services during the
 
04:57:03.050 --> 04:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
plan year and then it says for each of
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
the preceding Pain Management Services
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
to manage pain so proceeding would be
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
that list that we've been talking about
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes so the way I read this is one
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
interpretation could be it could mandate
 
04:57:18.550 --> 04:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
20 visits for each of those different
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
which could be you know I don't know 200
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
300 different visits is is that how you
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
meant that's not the intent the intent
 
04:57:27.770 --> 04:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
was 20 total
 
04:57:27.780 --> 04:57:29.890 align:start position:0%
was 20 total
okay

04:57:29.890 --> 04:57:29.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
be honest if I have a wish list it would
 
04:57:35.330 --> 04:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
be 20 for each
 
04:57:35.340 --> 04:57:36.890 align:start position:0%
be 20 for each
no

04:57:36.890 --> 04:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to change it
 
04:57:39.600 --> 04:57:40.670 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to change it
okay

04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
so uh representative who put in a bill
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
last year yes you're you're a rep so you
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
now last year your bill was yoga do we
 
04:58:02.030 --> 04:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
have yoga yes
 
04:58:08.090 --> 04:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:11.628 --> 04:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm representative manjipuri
 
04:58:16.250 --> 04:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
from Nashua Hillsborough 11. this is the
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
third term that this kind of bill with
 
04:58:23.770 --> 04:58:23.780 align:start position:0%
not my name on it this time
 
04:58:27.650 --> 04:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
has appeared so basically what this bill
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
is attempting to do is turn the Pyramid
 
04:58:35.090 --> 04:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
of Health Care System upside down if you
 
04:58:37.550 --> 04:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
all know how the nutrition thing was
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
pyramid with you know bottom was grains
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
and now it's upside down do the protein
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
on top and well fat so basically a
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
current a healthcare system is disease
 
04:58:51.958 --> 04:58:53.628 align:start position:0%
current a healthcare system is disease
based

04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
based
 
04:58:53.638 --> 04:58:55.070 align:start position:0%
based
and

04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:58.010 --> 04:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
treating the disease
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
so this attempts to Integrative Medicine
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking at a person not my left hand my
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
right hand The Specialist my right eye
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
go to the left eye specialist to treat
 
04:59:10.560 --> 04:59:11.650 align:start position:0%
go to the left eye specialist to treat
your

04:59:11.650 --> 04:59:11.660 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
left eye problem not the right eye kind
 
04:59:18.170 --> 04:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
of thing but this is looking at a whole
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
person who's dealing with pain and
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
preventive early intervention a holistic
 
04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
approach to what's available instead of
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
doing a piecemeal so
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
I've tried in several different forms
 
04:59:41.510 --> 04:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
first first term I presented it to
 
04:59:45.050 --> 04:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
introduced it to uh Health and Human
 
04:59:47.930 --> 04:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
Services and
 
04:59:47.940 --> 04:59:48.530 align:start position:0%
Services and
um

04:59:48.530 --> 04:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee and uh also worked
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
with one of the health health insurance
 
04:59:56.520 --> 04:59:58.970 align:start position:0%
with one of the health health insurance
folks

04:59:58.970 --> 04:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
folks
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
provider I won't name the name to do a
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
pilot how it can be impactful so
 
05:00:12.170 --> 05:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's different it's it's not very
 
05:00:14.810 --> 05:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
different but if you look at human
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
beings in what we are treating this
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense
 
05:00:19.680 --> 05:00:20.330 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense
um

05:00:20.330 --> 05:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
so I'll give you an example my husband
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
has a chronic back pain
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
and he has gone for multiple MRIs and
 
05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
you know his claustrophobic so they have
 
05:00:38.930 --> 05:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
to put him under to put them through CT
 
05:00:45.890 --> 05:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
scan or MRI and he dreads that and so
 
05:00:49.368 --> 05:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis is okay you do not have
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
any joint issue you do not have any uh
 
05:00:56.750 --> 05:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
tumor or anything thank goodness but
 
05:00:59.810 --> 05:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
they are not able to pinpoint what it is
 
05:00:59.820 --> 05:01:01.550 align:start position:0%
they are not able to pinpoint what it is
so

05:01:01.550 --> 05:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
they can do surgery
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
and other than taking medication he says
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
no I don't want to take painkillers
 
05:01:14.570 --> 05:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
extended period of time and so he has to
 
05:01:17.208 --> 05:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
function he's a public school teacher
 
05:01:19.730 --> 05:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
and he has to function as an individual
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
so finally he started going you know we
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
both are yoga practitioners and you know
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
we come from a place where yoga capital
 
05:01:31.850 --> 05:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
of the world
 
05:01:33.650 --> 05:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:01:37.128 --> 05:01:37.138 align:start position:0%
so this whole integrated approach it has
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
all taken uh in the manipulative
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
osteopathic manipulation he fixed the
 
05:01:47.330 --> 05:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
problem in two settings and to maintain
 
05:01:47.340 --> 05:01:48.770 align:start position:0%
problem in two settings and to maintain
it

05:01:48.770 --> 05:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
in that way was
 
05:01:56.208 --> 05:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
yeah yoga physical therapy and
 
05:02:00.288 --> 05:02:00.298 align:start position:0%
um chiropractor this is what it took
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
five years
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
of going through we had a good insurance
 
05:02:09.890 --> 05:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank goodness
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
and we could do that
 
05:02:17.390 --> 05:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
and the amount of money is spent on that
 
05:02:20.170 --> 05:02:20.180 align:start position:0%
if we had started this
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
intuitively say okay can we do this but
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't available it's not a
 
05:02:26.638 --> 05:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't available it's not a
mainstream

05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.288 --> 05:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
so these are I mean
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
this Integrative Medicine in the Eastern
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
medicine it is part of practice everyday
 
05:02:44.690 --> 05:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
practice how do I license
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
and make it quantitative
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
billable unit
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
is a challenge
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm persisting with that so I
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
give all kudos to
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel because he and I
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
have been sitting on this committee for
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
eight years now
 
05:03:08.878 --> 05:03:10.550 align:start position:0%
eight years now
so

05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
I would encourage if we can do a
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I can give you a lot of
 
05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
models that can work so I'm still
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
working on that to get some funding for
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
to do a pilot and show some significant
 
05:03:31.970 --> 05:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
evidence base it's like chicken or the
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
egg come first what comes first
 
05:03:38.810 --> 05:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
unless you have a pilot study or Pilot
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
to do it you can show an Evidence all
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
you have is anecdotal
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
so prevention is an ounce of prevention
 
05:03:51.948 --> 05:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
is better than a pound of cure it was
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
100 years ago it's today and it will be
 
05:03:57.890 --> 05:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
tomorrow thank you
 
05:04:00.170 --> 05:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a question representative
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
Yemen has a question
 
05:04:05.570 --> 05:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative benjibouti uh you you may
 
05:04:07.490 --> 05:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
remember you and I were seat mates for
 
05:04:09.650 --> 05:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
four years in the in the house so
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
well good to see you uh the previous
 
05:04:14.930 --> 05:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
speaker the prime sponsor said uh he
 
05:04:16.610 --> 05:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
considers removing he would consider
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
removing yoga Qigong and Tai Chi from
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
the bill is that your position
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
no what I would say is because there is
 
05:04:30.530 --> 05:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
no clear path of Licensing that appeared
 
05:04:34.208 --> 05:04:34.218 align:start position:0%
to kyoga okay there are therapeutic yoga
 
05:04:38.510 --> 05:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
providers that do exist but there is no
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
board but there are other states or
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
other places that have done it so I can
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
get you some information on that
 
05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.570 --> 05:04:53.580 align:start position:0%

05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for allowing me
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire acupuncture and Asian
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
medicine Society
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
and we do stand in support of this bill
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
HB 303
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're here today because we are Pain
 
05:05:55.730 --> 05:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
Care Specialists and it is our
 
05:05:57.708 --> 05:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
collective experience that acupuncture
 
05:06:00.650 --> 05:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
Qigong and Tai Chi when used together
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
with other pain management protocols
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
improve outcomes
 
05:06:07.010 --> 05:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
many of those have already been
 
05:06:09.530 --> 05:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned but um
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
I want you to just reiterate that every
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
Protocol no matter what it is for pain
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
management has its shortcomings and when
 
05:06:19.368 --> 05:06:19.378 align:start position:0%
it's used in conjunction with other
 
05:06:19.378 --> 05:06:20.690 align:start position:0%
it's used in conjunction with other
therapies

05:06:20.690 --> 05:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
we were able to reduce or avoid
 
05:06:24.770 --> 05:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
medications altogether
 
05:06:27.410 --> 05:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
we reduce negative side effects we speed
 
05:06:29.690 --> 05:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
up recovery
 
05:06:33.470 --> 05:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
we correct the root cause
 
05:06:37.070 --> 05:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
and we reduce anxiety and depression
 
05:06:40.128 --> 05:06:40.138 align:start position:0%
acupuncture is underutilized
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
less than nine percent of the insured
 
05:06:46.610 --> 05:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:50.448 --> 05:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
and listening to the others speak going
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
off script a little bit to address some
 
05:06:54.430 --> 05:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that have been brought up
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.120 --> 05:07:06.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
last night and this is a hard copy but
 
05:07:10.550 --> 05:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
also connected to it there's some
 
05:07:12.890 --> 05:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
research bullets I know your time is
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
very valuable and you don't always have
 
05:07:19.010 --> 05:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:21.490 --> 05:07:21.500 align:start position:0%
I'll let that pass around
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
and talk to speak to this specifically
 
05:07:27.128 --> 05:07:27.138 align:start position:0%
about Qigong that was raised
 
05:07:31.250 --> 05:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
I believe that although Qigong in New
 
05:07:35.410 --> 05:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not a licensed criteria
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists who are licensed were
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
trained at school
 
05:07:42.650 --> 05:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
to practice it and currently
 
05:07:42.660 --> 05:07:43.730 align:start position:0%
to practice it and currently
um

05:07:43.730 --> 05:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
if we're reimbursed by insurance for
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
acupuncture were not reimbursed for
 
05:07:48.360 --> 05:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
acupuncture were not reimbursed for
Qigong

05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
Qigong
 
05:07:53.690 --> 05:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
and yet it's medical uh protocol and so
 
05:07:55.850 --> 05:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
in thinking about that I would ask that
 
05:07:58.250 --> 05:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
you don't take Qigong out of this bill
 
05:08:00.190 --> 05:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
but in fact you would allow
 
05:08:02.990 --> 05:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists who are trained
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be reimbursed for this service also
 
05:08:12.110 --> 05:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:15.650 --> 05:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
and then if you draw your attention to
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
the second to last paragraph of the
 
05:08:19.208 --> 05:08:19.218 align:start position:0%
first page
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
also addressing the question that people
 
05:08:24.770 --> 05:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
over 65 who are on Medicare don't have
 
05:08:26.570 --> 05:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
access to acupuncture
 
05:08:28.850 --> 05:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's coming
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
um as of December you might not be aware
 
05:08:35.448 --> 05:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
that the no pain Act was passed at the
 
05:08:37.128 --> 05:08:37.138 align:start position:0%
federal level it become effective in
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
2025 and this will mandate at the
 
05:08:42.410 --> 05:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
federal level in Medicare that
 
05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
non-pharmaceutical and non-addictive
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
and then if you flip
 
05:08:52.798 --> 05:08:53.690 align:start position:0%
and then if you flip
um

05:08:53.690 --> 05:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:55.550 --> 05:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
to the back to the second research
 
05:08:57.890 --> 05:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
bullet that I have there
 
05:08:59.810 --> 05:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
you were asking if there's other models
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
out there that this has happened and Dr
 
05:09:02.760 --> 05:09:03.830 align:start position:0%
out there that this has happened and Dr
Nagel

05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
Nagel
 
05:09:05.448 --> 05:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
talked about some in the state but there
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
are actually five in the world that have
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
been looked at
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
um and two points of that you'll see
 
05:09:14.288 --> 05:09:14.298 align:start position:0%
that not only
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
the UK but Germany Switzerland China and
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
the US have models for this
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
but also in their research they came
 
05:09:26.930 --> 05:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
they noticed that the economics can
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
rarely be the only thing that's
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
considered we really have to look at the
 
05:09:34.368 --> 05:09:34.378 align:start position:0%
long-term outcomes of this
 
05:09:36.288 --> 05:09:36.298 align:start position:0%
and that's because it takes such a long
 
05:09:39.050 --> 05:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
time to fully understand the health
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
economics and in the meantime people
 
05:09:45.530 --> 05:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
also you may or may not know that
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
Medicare currently covers acupuncture
 
05:09:50.700 --> 05:09:52.430 align:start position:0%
Medicare currently covers acupuncture
however

05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
it's not really convenient since
 
05:09:56.570 --> 05:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists are not Medicare
 
05:09:56.580 --> 05:09:58.190 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists are not Medicare
providers

05:09:58.190 --> 05:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so under the current system it
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
covers low back injury
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
if it's Insidious
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
if it's more if the pain has been there
 
05:10:10.010 --> 05:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
for more than 12 weeks
 
05:10:10.020 --> 05:10:11.448 align:start position:0%
for more than 12 weeks
and

05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:13.610 --> 05:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
if you're seen by a medical doctor which
 
05:10:15.170 --> 05:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
we're not under the
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
license of a medical doctor
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
but the only way an acupuncturist can
 
05:10:22.970 --> 05:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
get reimbursement for Medicare at this
 
05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
time is if the medical doctor gets paid
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
and then pays the acupuncturist I don't
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
know any system or any medical doctor
 
05:10:33.170 --> 05:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
who's going to go through that
 
05:10:35.690 --> 05:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
so yes it's out there but only a medical
 
05:10:38.448 --> 05:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
doctor who performs acupuncture at this
 
05:10:40.368 --> 05:10:40.378 align:start position:0%
time are the ones who can get reimbursed
 
05:10:42.288 --> 05:10:42.298 align:start position:0%
by Medicare
 
05:10:44.750 --> 05:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's hopefully changing we do have a
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill that will be in the House of
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:49.920 --> 05:10:52.850 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:10:52.850 --> 05:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
the U.S house yes the federal house
 
05:10:58.310 --> 05:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and the last thing just to put out
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
there may be one of the most important
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
parts of this is that when Insurance
 
05:11:04.970 --> 05:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of these
 
05:11:04.980 --> 05:11:06.288 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of these
modalities

05:11:06.288 --> 05:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
modalities
 
05:11:08.930 --> 05:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
media grabs a hold of it
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
more people become aware of it more
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
people trust it more people will find
 
05:11:17.448 --> 05:11:17.458 align:start position:0%
access to it and then it'll spread and
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
then you'll see the economic economic
 
05:11:19.920 --> 05:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
then you'll see the economic economic
results

05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
results
 
05:11:28.330 --> 05:11:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.368 --> 05:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman my
 
05:11:33.170 --> 05:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
question is this protocol that you speak
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
about that uses several modalities of
 
05:11:35.878 --> 05:11:37.010 align:start position:0%
about that uses several modalities of
treatment

05:11:37.010 --> 05:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:11:37.020 --> 05:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
treatment
um

05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
if we were to permit say licensed
 
05:11:42.288 --> 05:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
acupuncture but omit the others is that
 
05:11:44.330 --> 05:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to cause a serious hardship for
 
05:11:45.770 --> 05:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
the treatment plans that you have
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
organized and have arranged that you
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
found effective
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to
 
05:11:52.080 --> 05:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to
um my

05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
um my
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
the way I work and patients that I work
 
05:11:55.980 --> 05:11:56.810 align:start position:0%
the way I work and patients that I work
with

05:11:56.810 --> 05:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:11:58.970 --> 05:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you two specific stories
 
05:12:01.310 --> 05:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
but very short
 
05:12:04.250 --> 05:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
when people have access
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
to acupuncture Qigong Physical Therapy
 
05:12:08.160 --> 05:12:10.128 align:start position:0%
to acupuncture Qigong Physical Therapy
Massage

05:12:10.128 --> 05:12:10.138 align:start position:0%
Massage
 
05:12:13.368 --> 05:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
yoga it's a wrap around service and
 
05:12:14.810 --> 05:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
people find the care that they need
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
because no pain is exactly the same
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
no person is exactly the same and what
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
their access
 
05:12:24.890 --> 05:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
what they're capable of is not the same
 
05:12:27.830 --> 05:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
so in two instances really quickly I
 
05:12:30.770 --> 05:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
work primarily with the geriatric the
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
senior population probably the average
 
05:12:35.810 --> 05:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
age of my patients is 75.
 
05:12:39.410 --> 05:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
I have one individual 80 years old he's
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
been on gabapentin for neuropathy
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
pain for over 30 years and the problem
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
with that is it causes dizziness and all
 
05:12:50.030 --> 05:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
of you know that dizziness is a high
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
risk for Falls
 
05:12:54.288 --> 05:12:54.298 align:start position:0%
and when we when you have a fall and
 
05:12:56.090 --> 05:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
you're 80 years old you're part of a
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
medical system and that's expensive
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
so his quest has been to reduce his
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
dizziness by getting off a Gabapentin
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
over the past year he's received regular
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
acupuncture he's in my Qigong class and
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
he's gone from 9 900 milligrams of big
 
05:13:14.570 --> 05:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
Gabapentin down to zero in a year and a
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
half he's no longer is it dizzy because
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
of Qigong his balance has improved and
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
because he's off Gabapentin he's no
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
longer dizzy so his quality of life has
 
05:13:24.360 --> 05:13:25.730 align:start position:0%
longer dizzy so his quality of life has
soared

05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
soared
 
05:13:28.850 --> 05:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
another person is 70 years old she was
 
05:13:30.970 --> 05:13:30.980 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with Insidious
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
nerve pain and spasticity
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
she was falling every single day and
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
walking with two walking sticks
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
um she ran into roadblocks she started
 
05:13:45.770 --> 05:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
to see me started my Qigong class
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
she only walks with a cane on occasion
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
her doctor has recently just told her
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
that if it weren't for Qigong and
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
acupuncture she would be in a wheelchair
 
05:13:55.080 --> 05:13:56.090 align:start position:0%
acupuncture she would be in a wheelchair
today

05:13:56.090 --> 05:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:03.050 --> 05:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
so is there any insurance company or any
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
employer that's now reimbursing you know
 
05:14:05.520 --> 05:14:06.948 align:start position:0%
employer that's now reimbursing you know
for

05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are insurance companies
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
um that do reimburse blue class and Blue
 
05:14:12.120 --> 05:14:13.250 align:start position:0%
um that do reimburse blue class and Blue
Shield

05:14:13.250 --> 05:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
Shield
 
05:14:13.260 --> 05:14:14.810 align:start position:0%
Shield
Cigna

05:14:14.810 --> 05:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
Cigna
 
05:14:16.730 --> 05:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing about that is
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
because they're not mandated those are
 
05:14:20.448 --> 05:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
writers and depending on the employer
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
they choose or
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
choose not to have the acupuncture
 
05:14:26.690 --> 05:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
writer or any other writer
 
05:14:28.368 --> 05:14:28.378 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't call it a writer what that
 
05:14:30.890 --> 05:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
is those are large employers that are
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
self-insured so they have decided to add
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that to their plans Okay so
 
05:14:38.330 --> 05:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandate so people are
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
choosing not the individual who's being
 
05:14:43.250 --> 05:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
insured but a bigger organization is
 
05:14:45.050 --> 05:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
choosing whether someone has access or
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
some large employers are doing it you
 
05:14:47.160 --> 05:14:47.810 align:start position:0%
some large employers are doing it you
have

05:14:47.810 --> 05:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:14:51.310 --> 05:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
yes and then on a personal experience
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
Cigna was in the state a couple of years
 
05:14:57.310 --> 05:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
back they were trying to get more
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists involved in the plan
 
05:15:03.250 --> 05:15:03.260 align:start position:0%
and yet they were offering different
 
05:15:07.010 --> 05:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists different reimbursements
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
different rates and so I can't say that
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of acupuncturists signed on to
 
05:15:13.490 --> 05:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
that because one the reimbursement was
 
05:15:16.730 --> 05:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
so low and then also the fact that they
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
were choosing to give different people
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
different reimbursements
 
05:15:25.490 --> 05:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:27.050 --> 05:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
take note George
 
05:15:27.060 --> 05:15:30.110 align:start position:0%
take note George
okay

05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:32.750 --> 05:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions thank you
 
05:15:36.050 --> 05:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
very much thank you okay so let's change
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
our Pace a little bit and hear from the
 
05:15:39.410 --> 05:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh so Heidi why don't you
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
05:16:03.170 --> 05:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
05:16:05.208 --> 05:16:05.218 align:start position:0%
is Heidi Kroll I work at Gallagher
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
Callahan and gartrell and I represent
 
05:16:08.448 --> 05:16:08.458 align:start position:0%
ahip which is America's health insurance
 
05:16:11.330 --> 05:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
plans we are the trade Association for
 
05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the health insurance carriers here in
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:16:16.788 --> 05:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the
 
05:16:19.128 --> 05:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
05:16:19.138 --> 05:16:20.330 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
um

05:16:20.330 --> 05:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:22.850 --> 05:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh as you might imagine we are opposed
 
05:16:25.970 --> 05:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 303 um for reasons which I
 
05:16:27.288 --> 05:16:27.298 align:start position:0%
will explain
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
um and we would respectfully request
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
that you find this bill in expedient to
 
05:16:30.840 --> 05:16:32.448 align:start position:0%
that you find this bill in expedient to
legislate

05:16:32.448 --> 05:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:16:34.610 --> 05:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost we do think that
 
05:16:37.250 --> 05:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
the bill is unnecessary we are not aware
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
of any other state where this extremely
 
05:16:42.430 --> 05:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
broad set of mandates exist
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
carriers in New Hampshire already do
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
offer a variety of health plans that
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
cover a range of treatment alternatives
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
to opioids both medications as well as
 
05:16:57.650 --> 05:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
medic alternative medications to opioids
 
05:17:00.850 --> 05:17:00.860 align:start position:0%
as well as non-medication options
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
and a variety of informational
 
05:17:05.570 --> 05:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
educational resources and materials as
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
well both to members and providers but
 
05:17:10.610 --> 05:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
as you might imagine carriers offer
 
05:17:12.410 --> 05:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
different plans with different covered
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
benefits which result in different
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
premiums and so members can choose the
 
05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
plan that best meets their needs and
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
their budgets
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
we did a little
 
05:17:27.650 --> 05:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of bills and I have
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
that later in my testimony we've had a
 
05:17:31.490 --> 05:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
number of bills over the years on this
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
topic most recently there was an ad hoc
 
05:17:36.170 --> 05:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
work group that was working on this over
 
05:17:38.330 --> 05:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
the summer as a result of a piece of
 
05:17:41.090 --> 05:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
legislation last year and we kind of did
 
05:17:44.030 --> 05:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
a little survey of our active members
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
here so Chiropractic Services Physical
 
05:17:49.850 --> 05:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
Therapy occupational therapy and tens
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
units seem to be universally covered
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
under a hip members standard plans
 
05:17:59.090 --> 05:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
coverage for acupuncture and gym
 
05:18:02.470 --> 05:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
memberships do vary by plan
 
05:18:05.570 --> 05:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
plans typically do not cover massage
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
outside of a covered Chiropractic PT or
 
05:18:10.560 --> 05:18:12.430 align:start position:0%
outside of a covered Chiropractic PT or
OT visit

05:18:12.430 --> 05:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
OT visit
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
meditation is not covered but it is
 
05:18:17.090 --> 05:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
included in the carriers Health and
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
Wellness Resources and I did bring a
 
05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
copy for myself but if you go on to any
 
05:18:25.368 --> 05:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
of the plans websites you will find that
 
05:18:28.430 --> 05:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
they have meditation and mindfulness
 
05:18:30.590 --> 05:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
resources that are made available to
 
05:18:33.610 --> 05:18:33.620 align:start position:0%
members and and to the public as well
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
including podcasts and things like that
 
05:18:40.128 --> 05:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
there's also a list at least that found
 
05:18:42.890 --> 05:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
one on Harvard Pilgrim's website it was
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
many many pages long about the
 
05:18:47.690 --> 05:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
alternative medications to opioids that
 
05:18:49.510 --> 05:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
they cover as well
 
05:18:52.430 --> 05:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
and of course a variety of Behavioral
 
05:18:54.610 --> 05:18:54.620 align:start position:0%
Health Services
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
as representative amond kind of picked
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
up on House Bill 303 lists approximately
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
by my count about 18 Services
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
which would are all seem to be qualified
 
05:19:08.810 --> 05:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
by the phrase including but not limited
 
05:19:11.810 --> 05:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
to indicating that there are unknown
 
05:19:13.730 --> 05:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
number of other services Beyond those
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
listed and we did have the same concern
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
that if you were to mandate coverage for
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 20 visits for each of the
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
services listed as well as those not
 
05:19:27.890 --> 05:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
listed but even if you try to narrow
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
that down if you were to do this across
 
05:19:32.448 --> 05:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
every single Health Plan offered by
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
carriers that would have upward pressure
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
on the premiums for everyone and the
 
05:19:40.368 --> 05:19:40.378 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does Echo
 
05:19:42.410 --> 05:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
that point
 
05:19:42.420 --> 05:19:43.670 align:start position:0%
that point
um

05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note because
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
because the bill looks to impose new
 
05:19:50.448 --> 05:19:50.458 align:start position:0%
mandates in the individual Market that
 
05:19:53.090 --> 05:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
exceed the state's Benchmark plan the
 
05:19:55.610 --> 05:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
state would also face a new Financial
 
05:19:55.620 --> 05:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
state would also face a new Financial
um

05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.770 --> 05:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
um there were some questions earlier
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
about this it is important to remember
 
05:20:06.050 --> 05:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
that the bill proposes to impose new
 
05:20:09.530 --> 05:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
mandates only on the fully insured uh
 
05:20:11.570 --> 05:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
individual small group and large group
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
markets which account for less than 25
 
05:20:16.910 --> 05:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire's market so in
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
addition to the fully insured there's
 
05:20:19.080 --> 05:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
addition to the fully insured there's
also

05:20:20.470 --> 05:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:20:22.550 --> 05:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
self-funded employer coverage there's
 
05:20:25.368 --> 05:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid military coverage
 
05:20:28.010 --> 05:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
people covered by out-of-state employers
 
05:20:30.288 --> 05:20:30.298 align:start position:0%
so that would not be impacted by this
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
man set of mandates and of course the
 
05:20:35.208 --> 05:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
uninsured so we're really talking about
 
05:20:37.010 --> 05:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
putting potentially some upward pressure
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
on premiums paid by New Hampshire
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
citizens who are in the individual
 
05:20:43.368 --> 05:20:43.378 align:start position:0%
Market or premiums paid by New Hampshire
 
05:20:47.810 --> 05:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
small to mid-size employers
 
05:20:50.208 --> 05:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
um another point is that covered
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
services from the plans perspective
 
05:20:55.550 --> 05:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
should always be evidence-based Services
 
05:20:58.010 --> 05:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
um and they're you know based on
 
05:21:00.550 --> 05:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
clinical and scientific the key word
 
05:21:02.930 --> 05:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
evidence-based right
 
05:21:05.208 --> 05:21:05.218 align:start position:0%
um and so uh there's a concern that this
 
05:21:08.090 --> 05:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
bill would override that important
 
05:21:11.090 --> 05:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
criteria and as some of you may know
 
05:21:13.010 --> 05:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
carriers do have independent review
 
05:21:16.570 --> 05:21:16.580 align:start position:0%
boards they're continually reviewing
 
05:21:20.090 --> 05:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
evidence and efficacy around medications
 
05:21:22.730 --> 05:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
and treatments and services and they
 
05:21:27.530 --> 05:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you've also touched upon this another
 
05:21:31.850 --> 05:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
concern we had is that
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
um there's mandates for coverage of
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
services that would not be provided by
 
05:21:38.510 --> 05:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
licensed and credentialed on clinical
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
providers and as we mentioned no medical
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
licensing or credentialing process for
 
05:21:47.810 --> 05:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
things like yoga chai Kong Tai Chi
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
aquatic exercise meditation training
 
05:21:54.890 --> 05:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
things like that and carriers networks
 
05:21:57.890 --> 05:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
are obviously a fundamental aspect of
 
05:22:00.410 --> 05:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage including the network
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy statutory licensing and
 
05:22:05.628 --> 05:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
credentialing requirements quality of
 
05:22:09.368 --> 05:22:09.378 align:start position:0%
care standards as you might recognize
 
05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know our stamp of approval on
 
05:22:13.970 --> 05:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
providers in the network means something
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the members and of course the
 
05:22:18.650 --> 05:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
negotiated reimbursement rates
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned when I first started
 
05:22:23.390 --> 05:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
we have had several bills
 
05:22:25.368 --> 05:22:25.378 align:start position:0%
um in the past as well as actually two
 
05:22:27.230 --> 05:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
others this session
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
um dealing with these similar issues
 
05:22:31.850 --> 05:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
um the two that are in this session
 
05:22:35.448 --> 05:22:35.458 align:start position:0%
actually are how we're trying referred
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
to house HHS
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
one is relative to alternatives to
 
05:22:40.798 --> 05:22:42.410 align:start position:0%
one is relative to alternatives to
opioids

05:22:42.410 --> 05:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
um it has five sections uh the first one
 
05:22:47.570 --> 05:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
is not an insurance mandate but the
 
05:22:50.208 --> 05:22:50.218 align:start position:0%
other four of five are and they look
 
05:22:52.970 --> 05:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
very very similar to this bill
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
um it's a sponsored by representative
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
Lundgren but representative Nagel is
 
05:22:58.990 --> 05:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
also a co-sponsor of that
 
05:23:01.730 --> 05:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
so just wanted to make you aware of that
 
05:23:04.550 --> 05:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill again that was House Bill 554 it
 
05:23:07.490 --> 05:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
does have an FN on it as well there's
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
another bill House Bill 666 establishing
 
05:23:12.970 --> 05:23:12.980 align:start position:0%
a commission to study
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
non-pharmacological treatment options
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
for patients with chronic pain that was
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
also sent to house HHS same two sponsors
 
05:23:25.550 --> 05:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
as House Bill 303 has that was an
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
outcome of House Bill 247 from last year
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
relative to treatment alternative to
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
opioids and as I mentioned
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
um that was actually a 2021 bill I think
 
05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
it was retained in a 2022 and they
 
05:23:41.208 --> 05:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
created an ad hoc group just kind of
 
05:23:43.128 --> 05:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
people willing to get together over the
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
summer which led to the idea of having a
 
05:23:48.970 --> 05:23:48.980 align:start position:0%
commission on this
 
05:23:51.230 --> 05:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
we've had two others I think or three
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
others in the past House Bill 1464 from
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
the 2019 session that was relative to
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage of yoga that was not
 
05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation by
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
this committee I believe on a vote of 14
 
05:24:07.550 --> 05:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
to 1 and that was when the Democrats
 
05:24:09.050 --> 05:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
were in the majority the current
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
chairman was actually not chairman at
 
05:24:12.190 --> 05:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
the time
 
05:24:15.650 --> 05:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
SB 708 relative to treatment alternative
 
05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
to opioids that died on the table and in
 
05:24:22.490 --> 05:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
2019 House Bill 610 again relative to
 
05:24:24.288 --> 05:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
treatment alternative to opioids that
 
05:24:28.250 --> 05:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
was it yelled by house HHS actually on a
 
05:24:30.310 --> 05:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
22-0 vote
 
05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
so we've covered this issue you know
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
lots of times in the past and I think
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that I've outlined here
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
today it's just given people some some
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
pause and some um
 
05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
heartburn I guess about going with such
 
05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
a broad mandate so I'm happy to answer
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
any questions and uh so given that this
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
bill only affects the small group we
 
05:24:52.730 --> 05:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
know it we would have to take the
 
05:24:55.010 --> 05:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
individual piece out because State's not
 
05:24:57.410 --> 05:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
going to pay cover that so if it only
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
the small group is there any benefit in
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
here that the small group I guess I'm
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
thinking we know the chiropractory is
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
covered up to 12 visits a year
 
05:25:10.970 --> 05:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
is there anything else is like uh
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture is there anything some that
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
is in the small group Market that
 
05:25:16.610 --> 05:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
someone could get that in the small
 
05:25:19.730 --> 05:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
group market today so the ACT
 
05:25:22.128 --> 05:25:22.138 align:start position:0%
the ACT varied by plan when we was when
 
05:25:24.890 --> 05:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
we surveyed um Harvard Pilgrim Anthem
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
and Cigna
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
um and I do know I think it was
 
05:25:30.050 --> 05:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
referenced by the prior speaker but um
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
at least in the case of one carrier
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
um did it maybe more did a full sweep of
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get acupuncturists to join the
 
05:25:37.920 --> 05:25:39.170 align:start position:0%
trying to get acupuncturists to join the
network

05:25:39.170 --> 05:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
network
 
05:25:41.330 --> 05:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
um last summer I think and and struggled
 
05:25:43.670 --> 05:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
with with that so fighting providers
 
05:25:46.850 --> 05:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
right but it varies by plan so not not
 
05:25:48.288 --> 05:25:48.298 align:start position:0%
everything so technically there's two
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
things now that's you know one is the
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic which we did mandate the
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
you know the 12 visits and then the
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
others but the acupuncture is now
 
05:25:57.120 --> 05:25:59.090 align:start position:0%
others but the acupuncture is now
voluntarily

05:25:59.090 --> 05:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
05:26:00.890 --> 05:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
it's in some plans and it's not in
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
others so if it's an important service
 
05:26:04.070 --> 05:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
for somebody that
 
05:26:05.448 --> 05:26:05.458 align:start position:0%
um right you know from an employer
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
perspective because I know in the past I
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
think once with natural pass
 
05:26:14.810 --> 05:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
I did May is may still in the statute or
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that did that get switched to showers
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
it may for a natural path to be your
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
primary care physician is that still in
 
05:26:22.430 --> 05:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
05:26:24.410 --> 05:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
would have to double check I don't
 
05:26:27.470 --> 05:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
recall it being changed from me but I so
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
that is something we have done in the
 
05:26:31.250 --> 05:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
past is just is put in May rather than
 
05:26:31.260 --> 05:26:32.390 align:start position:0%
past is just is put in May rather than
shall

05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
shall
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we did that for natural pass that's
 
05:26:38.690 --> 05:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.810 --> 05:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:26:44.810 --> 05:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
okay James
 
05:26:53.810 --> 05:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:53.820 --> 05:26:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:01.128 --> 05:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon hello
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank the committee for
 
05:27:05.390 --> 05:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify on behalf of the
 
05:27:06.970 --> 05:27:06.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiropractic Association
 
05:27:11.510 --> 05:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I am in favor of house bill 303.
 
05:27:11.520 --> 05:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
and I am in favor of house bill 303.
um

05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
my name is James Pamplin I've been a
 
05:27:16.970 --> 05:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
practicing chiropractor for over 20
 
05:27:19.368 --> 05:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
years in New Hampshire
 
05:27:22.550 --> 05:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
during that time I'm also a member of
 
05:27:23.448 --> 05:27:23.458 align:start position:0%
the board of the New Hampshire
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Association
 
05:27:29.448 --> 05:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
um during my 20 years practicing I have
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately seen a gradual decline in
 
05:27:37.128 --> 05:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:37.138 --> 05:27:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:42.190 --> 05:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
this has resulted in my practice
 
05:27:45.890 --> 05:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
canceling contracts for seven out of the
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
10 major insurance carriers
 
05:27:50.448 --> 05:27:50.458 align:start position:0%
the reason for this decision was based
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
on four issues
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
the first was that we are seeing higher
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
co-pays that are now
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
um exceeding the benefit payouts for
 
05:28:04.010 --> 05:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
each visit
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
so patients aren't getting much of a
 
05:28:07.850 --> 05:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
benefit from insurance when their
 
05:28:10.970 --> 05:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
co-pays are 40 50 60 dollars
 
05:28:14.170 --> 05:28:14.180 align:start position:0%
number two deductible
 
05:28:18.770 --> 05:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.780 --> 05:28:20.110 align:start position:0%
 
are

05:28:20.110 --> 05:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
deductible increases are now eclipsing
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
any cost and treatment plans that we
 
05:28:29.570 --> 05:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
would prescribe to our patients
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
number three related more specifically
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
to this bill is Insurance visits
 
05:28:34.620 --> 05:28:36.288 align:start position:0%
to this bill is Insurance visits
limits

05:28:36.288 --> 05:28:36.298 align:start position:0%
limits
 
05:28:36.298 --> 05:28:37.010 align:start position:0%
limits
um

05:28:37.010 --> 05:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
are less than what is needed in order to
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
relieve the patient's symptoms or
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
prevent relapses
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
number four again related to this bill
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that essential services like re-exams
 
05:28:53.930 --> 05:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
or extremity adjustings adjusting
 
05:28:53.940 --> 05:28:55.128 align:start position:0%
or extremity adjustings adjusting
um

05:28:55.128 --> 05:28:55.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:57.288 --> 05:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
especially with re-exams where it's
 
05:29:00.590 --> 05:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
required for patient safety
 
05:29:02.510 --> 05:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
um is no longer being reimbursed when
 
05:29:05.810 --> 05:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
services are done on the same day
 
05:29:08.990 --> 05:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
um these are fiscal or financial burdens
 
05:29:09.000 --> 05:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
um these are fiscal or financial burdens
to

05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:13.490 --> 05:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
most of your constituents
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
and they
 
05:29:15.000 --> 05:29:16.970 align:start position:0%
and they
um

05:29:16.970 --> 05:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
they pose
 
05:29:20.570 --> 05:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
a very
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
real and significant obstacle to
 
05:29:26.330 --> 05:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.340 --> 05:29:27.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:27.958 --> 05:29:30.708 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:33.530 --> 05:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Care is evidence-based it's
 
05:29:36.890 --> 05:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
been proven in many studies to be safer
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
05:29:43.250 --> 05:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:43.260 --> 05:29:43.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:29:43.788 --> 05:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:47.650 --> 05:29:47.660 align:start position:0%
and so the bottom line is is that
 
05:29:49.970 --> 05:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
your constituents shouldn't have to pay
 
05:29:52.250 --> 05:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
higher insurance premiums for less
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
quality Chiropractic Care
 
05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:01.490 --> 05:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
why I'm in support of this bill and I
 
05:30:05.690 --> 05:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
so what is in this bill that's different
 
05:30:10.730 --> 05:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
than the Chiropractic mandate that we
 
05:30:13.070 --> 05:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
already have in our statute
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
this uh promotes 20 uh Insurance uh
 
05:30:19.128 --> 05:30:19.138 align:start position:0%
visits but in terms of it doesn't solve
 
05:30:21.230 --> 05:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
the problem the co-pays deductibles and
 
05:30:22.550 --> 05:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything like that actually doesn't all
 
05:30:25.970 --> 05:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
it does is go from 12 to 20. it also uh
 
05:30:28.490 --> 05:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully will cover more services that
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
are essential like uh re-exams and uh
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
um extremely adjusting and and maybe
 
05:30:36.170 --> 05:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
some other answers isn't that in the 12
 
05:30:42.910 --> 05:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:44.810 --> 05:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
right just trying to understand the
 
05:30:44.820 --> 05:30:45.530 align:start position:0%
right just trying to understand the
difference

05:30:45.530 --> 05:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:30:48.770 --> 05:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
05:30:52.128 --> 05:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.530 --> 05:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
okay I'll switch back to an insurance
 
05:31:11.628 --> 05:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.128 --> 05:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee I see some familiar faces and
 
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
lots of new ones uh for the record uh
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
Peter Bragdon I'm a senior policy
 
05:31:20.170 --> 05:31:20.180 align:start position:0%
advisor with pretty strategies
 
05:31:22.128 --> 05:31:22.138 align:start position:0%
representing uh Harvard Pilgrim
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
Healthcare a not-for-profit health
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
insurance company I think perhaps the
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
only not-for-profit insurance company
 
05:31:29.448 --> 05:31:29.458 align:start position:0%
certainly the largest not-for-profit
 
05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
05:31:33.530 --> 05:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and though we're opposed to the bill
 
05:31:36.170 --> 05:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
we are strong supporters of non-opioid
 
05:31:39.410 --> 05:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
Pain Management Service as evidenced by
 
05:31:41.570 --> 05:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
the fact that we offer a wide variety of
 
05:31:43.930 --> 05:31:43.940 align:start position:0%
these services to our members already
 
05:31:46.730 --> 05:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
and we're opposed to the bill for for
 
05:31:48.530 --> 05:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
five reasons first of all and some of
 
05:31:50.330 --> 05:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
these were covered by by Heidi earlier
 
05:31:52.730 --> 05:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
so I won't go into much detail uh but
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
first we feel it's not needed because as
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
noted we already cover a wide variety of
 
05:31:59.270 --> 05:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
non-opioid Pain Management Services for
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
instance all of our plans cover Physical
 
05:32:04.368 --> 05:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
Therapy occupational therapy all of our
 
05:32:06.490 --> 05:32:06.500 align:start position:0%
individual and small group plans cover
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic acupuncture as well as we
 
05:32:12.650 --> 05:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
also cover a wide range of of non-opioid
 
05:32:14.690 --> 05:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
medications themselves as Alternatives
 
05:32:16.610 --> 05:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
so these are already provided we don't
 
05:32:20.570 --> 05:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
provide coverage for mediation services
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
provided by somebody external however as
 
05:32:25.128 --> 05:32:25.138 align:start position:0%
Heidi mentioned we do have a website
 
05:32:27.890 --> 05:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
available with a lot of resources on
 
05:32:30.650 --> 05:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
mindfulness and mediation resources
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
including articles and actual recordings
 
05:32:35.690 --> 05:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
of guided meditations so we provide
 
05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
Alternatives where we can especially on
 
05:32:40.610 --> 05:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
the area areas where it might be tough
 
05:32:42.050 --> 05:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
to find a as was brought up before
 
05:32:44.410 --> 05:32:44.420 align:start position:0%
licensed providers although
 
05:32:46.990 --> 05:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
chiropractors and acupuncturers
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists are licensed by the state
 
05:32:52.430 --> 05:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things on here that are
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
not and so we provide some resources to
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
help in that area the second reason
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're opposed is certainly creates
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
mandates and we feel mandates increase
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
costs one size does not fit all we offer
 
05:33:07.010 --> 05:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
a variety of plans with various benefit
 
05:33:09.288 --> 05:33:09.298 align:start position:0%
levels including different coverage
 
05:33:11.208 --> 05:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
levels for things allows us to meet the
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
needs of our our members while also
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
allowing them to meet their budgetary
 
05:33:14.638 --> 05:33:15.670 align:start position:0%
allowing them to meet their budgetary
needs

05:33:15.670 --> 05:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:33:18.110 --> 05:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
as mentioned before requiring Services
 
05:33:21.170 --> 05:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written for 20 visits for
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
each of a dozen or more different types
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
of services will certainly be a
 
05:33:27.948 --> 05:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
significant cost increase and as
 
05:33:29.570 --> 05:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned also would also impact the
 
05:33:31.190 --> 05:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
state budget because there's 50 000
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
people that get their insurance off the
 
05:33:35.330 --> 05:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
state exchange for which the state would
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay for any of these increased
 
05:33:40.368 --> 05:33:40.378 align:start position:0%
costs in premiums as a result
 
05:33:42.230 --> 05:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
number three reason lack of
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
credentialing licensing and oversight we
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
are strongly opposed to any coverage
 
05:33:48.050 --> 05:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
mandate where we would not be able to
 
05:33:50.510 --> 05:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
determine if the provider is safe and
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
qualified to treat our members as I
 
05:33:54.770 --> 05:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of these provide services
 
05:33:56.930 --> 05:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
on here are already licensed and we
 
05:33:58.610 --> 05:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
cover those so chiropractors
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists Etc but there's many that
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
are not
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
similar to that discussed before was the
 
05:34:08.570 --> 05:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
the need for evidence-based Services we
 
05:34:10.490 --> 05:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
have a duty to our members to make sure
 
05:34:12.288 --> 05:34:12.298 align:start position:0%
we are covering services that have been
 
05:34:13.850 --> 05:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
studied to determine they are effective
 
05:34:15.948 --> 05:34:15.958 align:start position:0%
and cost efficient because after all
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's those members who are paying for it
 
05:34:20.690 --> 05:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
so we look for evidence-based studies to
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
show that these are effective and
 
05:34:25.368 --> 05:34:25.378 align:start position:0%
efficient services and for many of these
 
05:34:27.530 --> 05:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
things list in the bill we are not aware
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
of any broad studies proving that these
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
servers are effective or cost efficient
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
and finally this bill goes beyond well
 
05:34:35.810 --> 05:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
beyond what other states do it was
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
represented to you that a similar bill
 
05:34:39.288 --> 05:34:39.298 align:start position:0%
is in uh has actually passed in
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the Massachusetts Law
 
05:34:43.550 --> 05:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
requires carriers to ensure they cover
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
at least two alternative medications and
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
at least three non-medication treatment
 
05:34:52.010 --> 05:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
options it doesn't specify which ones
 
05:34:53.448 --> 05:34:53.458 align:start position:0%
they have to cover it allows the
 
05:34:55.788 --> 05:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
carriers the flexibility they need to
 
05:34:57.890 --> 05:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
determine the mix of services this bill
 
05:35:00.830 --> 05:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
prescribes dozen or so treatments that
 
05:35:02.570 --> 05:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
have to be provided to everybody the
 
05:35:04.490 --> 05:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts bill is is nothing like
 
05:35:08.330 --> 05:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
this so for the reasons stated above we
 
05:35:11.150 --> 05:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
again we support alternatives to the
 
05:35:11.160 --> 05:35:12.250 align:start position:0%
again we support alternatives to the
pain

05:35:12.250 --> 05:35:12.260 align:start position:0%
pain
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
non-opioid pain Services about we feel
 
05:35:17.690 --> 05:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
this bill just does not does not get our
 
05:35:17.700 --> 05:35:18.590 align:start position:0%
this bill just does not does not get our
support

05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:35:19.970 --> 05:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions Mr
 
05:35:19.980 --> 05:35:21.288 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions Mr
chairman

05:35:21.288 --> 05:35:21.298 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:35:23.208 --> 05:35:23.218 align:start position:0%
so did Harvard support that
 
05:35:25.730 --> 05:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts bill I was not uh
 
05:35:26.810 --> 05:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
registered as a lobbyist in
 
05:35:28.510 --> 05:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you
 
05:35:32.448 --> 05:35:32.458 align:start position:0%
right well I guess the question is is
 
05:35:35.930 --> 05:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
were the in that mandate it was two and
 
05:35:38.810 --> 05:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
three were those things that you guys
 
05:35:38.820 --> 05:35:40.448 align:start position:0%
three were those things that you guys
offer

05:35:40.448 --> 05:35:40.458 align:start position:0%
offer
 
05:35:42.890 --> 05:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
would you be able to comply with that if
 
05:35:44.270 --> 05:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
we had passed that who passed that in
 
05:35:46.550 --> 05:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would you be if we'd be
 
05:35:48.410 --> 05:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
able to comply with it yeah because I
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
think we already do offer these
 
05:35:52.610 --> 05:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
Alternatives Bingo okay
 
05:35:59.448 --> 05:35:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:59.458 --> 05:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:03.708 --> 05:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
anybody who's done
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
um what I would call
 
05:36:09.730 --> 05:36:09.740 align:start position:0%
research on the exogenous
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
effects of not providing this uh these
 
05:36:17.350 --> 05:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
Services Research on what
 
05:36:19.730 --> 05:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
exogenous in other words Psych the oil
 
05:36:19.740 --> 05:36:20.930 align:start position:0%
exogenous in other words Psych the oil
industry

05:36:20.930 --> 05:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:36:23.570 --> 05:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay for the pollution
 
05:36:23.580 --> 05:36:24.708 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay for the pollution
that's

05:36:24.708 --> 05:36:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:36:27.230 --> 05:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
created by oil
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to think if anybody's and
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
and there are studies on that I was just
 
05:36:34.010 --> 05:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are any studies that
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
somebody attempted to
 
05:36:41.690 --> 05:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
um go into and do a study where the
 
05:36:44.270 --> 05:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
services are not provided
 
05:36:46.690 --> 05:36:46.700 align:start position:0%
and the impacts
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
that creates the costs that recreates uh
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
whereas they could do it uh you know
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
another study that would show that those
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
costs were ameliorated these are
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
external costs that are not put into the
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
budget is what I'm getting at right
 
05:37:06.050 --> 05:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
right so thank you I don't I'm not aware
 
05:37:08.930 --> 05:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
of a study that does that we get a lot
 
05:37:10.570 --> 05:37:10.580 align:start position:0%
of anecdotal
 
05:37:13.368 --> 05:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
uh in fact I don't know anybody that
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't give you an anecdote that uh
 
05:37:19.368 --> 05:37:19.378 align:start position:0%
yoga or stretching on you know on your
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
own in your living room has helped uh
 
05:37:24.590 --> 05:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
relieve pain so
 
05:37:26.270 --> 05:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
but nobody's it doesn't sound to me like
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
anybody's actually done a serious
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
academic uh look at these external costs
 
05:37:32.570 --> 05:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you for your question I'm
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
not aware of some of the the sponsor of
 
05:37:36.410 --> 05:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
this bill maybe uh can shed some light
 
05:37:37.970 --> 05:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
on that as well I will mention too
 
05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
something I know what I made during some
 
05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
of the testimony is you had a lot of
 
05:37:43.368 --> 05:37:43.378 align:start position:0%
anecdotal incidents brought up where
 
05:37:45.288 --> 05:37:45.298 align:start position:0%
somebody who is 70 years old got this
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
treatment and uh wanted me able to a
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
number of them they all the other ones I
 
05:37:50.570 --> 05:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
heard dealt with people on Medicaid this
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't affect anybody on Medicaid
 
05:37:54.590 --> 05:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare sorry Medicare not Medicare not
 
05:37:57.410 --> 05:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid not vets not large self-insured
 
05:38:00.050 --> 05:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
groups uh it was mentioned that only I
 
05:38:01.970 --> 05:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
think nine percent of people in the
 
05:38:04.010 --> 05:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
state qualify for coverage for one of
 
05:38:05.448 --> 05:38:05.458 align:start position:0%
these Services
 
05:38:08.090 --> 05:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
um but remember we're only dealing with
 
05:38:10.128 --> 05:38:10.138 align:start position:0%
individuals in small groups this is only
 
05:38:13.010 --> 05:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
less than 25 percent of and the carriers
 
05:38:14.090 --> 05:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
as far as I know Harvard Pilgrim
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
certainly does and I think all the other
 
05:38:16.550 --> 05:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
people in the small group and the
 
05:38:18.410 --> 05:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
individual Market already cover all
 
05:38:20.390 --> 05:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
these so you're really trying to address
 
05:38:22.368 --> 05:38:22.378 align:start position:0%
something that you to have no authority
 
05:38:25.368 --> 05:38:25.378 align:start position:0%
over a Medicare Medicaid veterans Etc so
 
05:38:27.050 --> 05:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
the answer is no nobody's done an
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
academic study on the external class I'm
 
05:38:31.970 --> 05:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
not aware of anything but not my
 
05:38:31.980 --> 05:38:37.368 align:start position:0%
not aware of anything but not my
expertise

05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay
 
05:38:42.050 --> 05:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
chairman okay uh Dr Dan from the
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic Association which
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's a very nice signature but I I don't
 
05:38:55.850 --> 05:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
know what that last name is it parents
 
05:38:57.890 --> 05:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's my best writing is that parent
 
05:39:00.288 --> 05:39:00.298 align:start position:0%
parent yes okay so I did get it thank
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you all thank you
 
05:39:04.490 --> 05:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
all for your time thank you for allowing
 
05:39:06.288 --> 05:39:06.298 align:start position:0%
me to present today
 
05:39:08.330 --> 05:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dr Daniel parent I am here
 
05:39:10.190 --> 05:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
I am the vice president of the New
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiropractic Association I am
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
representing my colleagues and my
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
patients your constituents in regards to
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
my support for uh House Bill 303 I think
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to focus on the 20 visit limit
 
05:39:25.430 --> 05:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
um chairman Hyundai I believe you
 
05:39:27.890 --> 05:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
spearheaded the 12 visit limit for us
 
05:39:30.650 --> 05:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
back sometime uh I was in the room okay
 
05:39:32.288 --> 05:39:32.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
05:39:35.448 --> 05:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
you actually voted for it because life
 
05:39:38.570 --> 05:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
here was that a company might choose not
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
to cover Chiropractic anymore once we
 
05:39:45.470 --> 05:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
mandated that 12 and sure enough Cigna
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
dropped it at the time
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
so that was my concern I understood
 
05:39:51.830 --> 05:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you well we appreciate your effort
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
on that just being in the room helped
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the 12 visit in my
 
05:40:00.770 --> 05:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
practice of 28 years what I find
 
05:40:02.810 --> 05:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
clinically is that people that come into
 
05:40:04.850 --> 05:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
chronic are acute pain it takes
 
05:40:07.730 --> 05:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 visits 10 8 10 12
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
visits to get them somewhat out of pain
 
05:40:11.810 --> 05:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
and get them somewhat functional the
 
05:40:13.128 --> 05:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
additional eight visits and that's
 
05:40:14.750 --> 05:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's all this is asking for is an
 
05:40:16.910 --> 05:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
additional eight which we're not asking
 
05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
for uh extended period after that but
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
eight will allow us the time to help
 
05:40:23.868 --> 05:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
them change lifestyle habits help them
 
05:40:26.090 --> 05:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
incorporate postural exercises help them
 
05:40:29.350 --> 05:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
utilize and incorporate lifestyle uh
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
things outside of the office to help
 
05:40:33.590 --> 05:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
them stabilize their conditions so
 
05:40:34.970 --> 05:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
they're not returning on a regular basis
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
with the same condition repeatedly over
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
and over and over again
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
I had something written out here but I'm
 
05:40:43.730 --> 05:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
going to digress a little bit we talked
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk much about lifestyle we
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
did earlier
 
05:40:48.288 --> 05:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
um two of the presenters talked about
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
lifestyle change and the upside down
 
05:40:52.930 --> 05:40:52.940 align:start position:0%
pyramid and while we might have
 
05:40:55.970 --> 05:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
additional drugs that might replace
 
05:40:55.980 --> 05:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
additional drugs that might replace
opioids

05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
05:40:59.690 --> 05:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
I still believe we're going in the wrong
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
direction if we take a look at lifestyle
 
05:41:02.040 --> 05:41:03.170 align:start position:0%
direction if we take a look at lifestyle
first

05:41:03.170 --> 05:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
and while they may or may not be
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
evidence-based in regards to the
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
efficacy of yoga my patients who do yoga
 
05:41:11.208 --> 05:41:11.218 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and incorporate it
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
into their daily routine and lifestyle I
 
05:41:15.890 --> 05:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
can guarantee you they're healthy I can
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee you they're healthy than those
 
05:41:19.990 --> 05:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
who sit all day sorry
 
05:41:23.930 --> 05:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
and listen to us okay Qigong the same
 
05:41:27.230 --> 05:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's when we start to when we start to
 
05:41:29.330 --> 05:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
give our patients the power to make
 
05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
their own choices outside of our offices
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
but also give them options that they may
 
05:41:35.150 --> 05:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
not be aware of
 
05:41:37.670 --> 05:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
with yoga with Qigong with Chiropractic
 
05:41:40.250 --> 05:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
with nutrition what are you going to do
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
for yourselves to help keep yourselves
 
05:41:42.530 --> 05:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
out of
 
05:41:43.970 --> 05:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
the system
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
because we know the system chases
 
05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
symptoms we know it does nothing for the
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
most part to help them become healthy
 
05:41:51.948 --> 05:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
and live their Lifestyles the way they
 
05:41:53.570 --> 05:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
should or want to
 
05:41:55.368 --> 05:41:55.378 align:start position:0%
I still believe that we're looking at
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
system from the wrong angle
 
05:41:57.120 --> 05:41:58.730 align:start position:0%
system from the wrong angle
now

05:41:58.730 --> 05:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:41:58.740 --> 05:41:59.868 align:start position:0%
now
I'm

05:41:59.868 --> 05:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:42:02.690 --> 05:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
in regards to evidence-based my question
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
is was there evidence-based research
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
that proved the efficacy and possibility
 
05:42:11.690 --> 05:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
the possibility of even the
 
05:42:13.850 --> 05:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
addictiveness of opioids
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
is there an evident evidence-based study
 
05:42:17.090 --> 05:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
that proved those things
 
05:42:18.650 --> 05:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
but they're still allowed to be put in
 
05:42:21.050 --> 05:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
and where my cousin's 16 year old son
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
had a football injury in high school
 
05:42:29.690 --> 05:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
and he's now dead
 
05:42:32.090 --> 05:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
from overdosing I'm sure there was
 
05:42:34.490 --> 05:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
evidence that said it's okay to give
 
05:42:37.010 --> 05:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
this 16 year old injured athlete a drug
 
05:42:38.930 --> 05:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
to mask his pain
 
05:42:40.550 --> 05:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
but not to deal with his life and his
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and deal with the issues that
 
05:42:43.368 --> 05:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
brought him in there in the first place
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
and and go towards the the issue itself
 
05:42:50.208 --> 05:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
instead of masking it
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
you could no longer get opioids so he
 
05:42:54.530 --> 05:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
ran to heroin
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.320 --> 05:43:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:43:00.410 --> 05:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're asking for much in
 
05:43:03.770 --> 05:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
this bill I know these things have been
 
05:43:05.448 --> 05:43:05.458 align:start position:0%
brought up before we talk about cost
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in regard in regards to
 
05:43:08.570 --> 05:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic we've been in front of this
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee numerous times showing
 
05:43:11.930 --> 05:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
research after research after research
 
05:43:14.208 --> 05:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
study that shows the cost effectiveness
 
05:43:16.128 --> 05:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
of Chiropractic Care
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
and it's evidence-based value
 
05:43:20.930 --> 05:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
yet it continues to get kicked down the
 
05:43:20.940 --> 05:43:21.948 align:start position:0%
yet it continues to get kicked down the
road

05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
road
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
because costs seem to be the issue
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
I don't believe costs to be the issue
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
if you start incorporating lifestyle
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and giving people the power to
 
05:43:33.230 --> 05:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
make their own choices outside of our
 
05:43:33.240 --> 05:43:34.430 align:start position:0%
make their own choices outside of our
offices

05:43:34.430 --> 05:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
offices
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a change in the
 
05:43:36.240 --> 05:43:37.368 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a change in the
system

05:43:37.368 --> 05:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
yet we don't do that
 
05:43:43.070 --> 05:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.010 --> 05:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
here take this take it home
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
but continue to sit continue to eat what
 
05:43:50.208 --> 05:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
you're eating don't exercise
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
don't meditate don't be mindful don't
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
okay it's our responsibility as
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
individuals to take care of ourselves
 
05:44:02.448 --> 05:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
but I think we need a better system to
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
guide us because most don't know where
 
05:44:06.530 --> 05:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
to go most don't know how to take care
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
of themselves we didn't come with it we
 
05:44:11.570 --> 05:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
didn't come with a with a owner's manual
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
if you will this I believe has
 
05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
spearheaded that
 
05:44:19.010 --> 05:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
we need to start incorporating into our
 
05:44:22.670 --> 05:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
society these types of things
 
05:44:22.680 --> 05:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
society these types of things
hey

05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
hey
 
05:44:25.730 --> 05:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
instead of relying on the same old same
 
05:44:25.740 --> 05:44:26.570 align:start position:0%
instead of relying on the same old same
old

05:44:26.570 --> 05:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
old
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
which is guys this place in the first
 
05:44:30.530 --> 05:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
place and if you want to talk about cost
 
05:44:32.330 --> 05:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness keep doing the same thing
 
05:44:35.570 --> 05:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
now costs continue to rise
 
05:44:37.490 --> 05:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
the deductibles go up the co-pays go up
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
our premiums go up
 
05:44:41.208 --> 05:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
so if we want to talk about cost
 
05:44:43.010 --> 05:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness this isn't working because
 
05:44:44.470 --> 05:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
our our
 
05:44:46.970 --> 05:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
costs per person
 
05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
continue to rise in regards to
 
05:44:48.600 --> 05:44:49.548 align:start position:0%
continue to rise in regards to
healthcare

05:44:49.548 --> 05:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
now that might be linked to business
 
05:44:52.368 --> 05:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
that might be linked to other things as
 
05:44:52.378 --> 05:44:54.770 align:start position:0%
that might be linked to other things as
well

05:44:54.770 --> 05:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:57.530 --> 05:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
but if we started educating our people
 
05:44:59.810 --> 05:44:59.820 align:start position:0%
our constituents our patients on
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
alternatives to take care of themselves
 
05:45:03.288 --> 05:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
better we might be in a different
 
05:45:03.298 --> 05:45:06.470 align:start position:0%
better we might be in a different
situation

05:45:06.470 --> 05:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
I thank you all that concludes my
 
05:45:10.310 --> 05:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
testimony if anybody has any questions
 
05:45:12.048 --> 05:45:12.058 align:start position:0%
please ask
 
05:45:13.850 --> 05:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you that was very compelling yeah
 
05:45:21.590 --> 05:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:21.600 --> 05:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
pharmacist

05:45:23.150 --> 05:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
05:45:23.160 --> 05:45:23.930 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
um

05:45:23.930 --> 05:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
alternative medicine
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
um there are several
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
not doctors
 
05:45:33.650 --> 05:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
um that will prescribe what you're
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
talking about how would an individual or
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
student or learn more about alternatives
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
to medication Tick Tock I'm just kidding
 
05:45:44.520 --> 05:45:46.990 align:start position:0%
to medication Tick Tock I'm just kidding
yeah

05:45:46.990 --> 05:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:45:48.948 --> 05:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
it sounds like if you don't go to a
 
05:45:51.708 --> 05:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
chiropractor you don't really or know
 
05:45:52.970 --> 05:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
someone that goes to a chiropractor
 
05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
right you don't get that understanding
 
05:45:57.770 --> 05:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
of alternative you know
 
05:45:59.690 --> 05:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
um not medicine because I don't believe
 
05:46:01.788 --> 05:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
it should be alternative medicine I
 
05:46:03.170 --> 05:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
think it should be Alternative Care
 
05:46:03.180 --> 05:46:04.570 align:start position:0%
think it should be Alternative Care
right

05:46:04.570 --> 05:46:04.580 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
where would that education come from
 
05:46:08.330 --> 05:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
you've got to find it
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
you've got to find it the same thing
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
with teaching my adult children about
 
05:46:13.850 --> 05:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
how to use their money and invest it
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
properly and not pay fees over fees over
 
05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
fees you've got to find ways to do these
 
05:46:18.660 --> 05:46:19.310 align:start position:0%
fees you've got to find ways to do these
things

05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's not it's it hasn't come to the
 
05:46:22.320 --> 05:46:23.330 align:start position:0%
it's not it's it hasn't come to the
Forefront

05:46:23.330 --> 05:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
Forefront
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's not of the media
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll say that it's not on the media
 
05:46:29.810 --> 05:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't teach it because they're funded
 
05:46:30.890 --> 05:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
by people
 
05:46:33.470 --> 05:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
that don't allow it to be taught
 
05:46:36.170 --> 05:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
so for us it's right now as individuals
 
05:46:37.490 --> 05:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
as practitioners in this room to support
 
05:46:38.448 --> 05:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:46:40.368 --> 05:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to do it and it's a small
 
05:46:40.378 --> 05:46:41.448 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to do it and it's a small
group

05:46:41.448 --> 05:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
but until this becomes mainstream we're
 
05:46:46.128 --> 05:46:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:48.288 --> 05:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:46:48.298 --> 05:46:50.930 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
thanks

05:46:50.930 --> 05:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.310 --> 05:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
oh we do have a question sorry
 
05:46:52.320 --> 05:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
oh we do have a question sorry
representative

05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.650 --> 05:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
I understand when you talk about going
 
05:47:00.350 --> 05:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
from 12 visits to 20 visits in order to
 
05:47:02.448 --> 05:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
get some maintenance and and and more
 
05:47:05.810 --> 05:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
but this bill is down at the insurance
 
05:47:09.170 --> 05:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
company level
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
how is that going to help
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
and many and several of the insurance
 
05:47:16.670 --> 05:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
companies already talked about they
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
cover some of these things in various
 
05:47:20.810 --> 05:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
different ways and that in fact the bill
 
05:47:23.810 --> 05:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
is only going to cover 25 percent of
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire subscribers anyway because
 
05:47:29.090 --> 05:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid they won't cover it
 
05:47:29.100 --> 05:47:31.788 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid they won't cover it
right

05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.650 --> 05:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
do you think that the medical profession
 
05:47:33.660 --> 05:47:35.690 align:start position:0%
do you think that the medical profession
itself

05:47:35.690 --> 05:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:43.730 --> 05:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
to inform people of these kinds of
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
things not insurance companies I'm not
 
05:47:49.610 --> 05:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
clear on why the insurance company is
 
05:47:52.250 --> 05:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for that as opposed to the
 
05:47:53.570 --> 05:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
medical profession right that's where
 
05:47:55.730 --> 05:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
I've learned everything from right
 
05:47:58.610 --> 05:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
I think I think we took an oath to take
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
care of our people right but then what
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
this bill puts the onus on the insurance
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
company and the I I believe that the
 
05:48:06.890 --> 05:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
bill puts some of the the onus which
 
05:48:08.570 --> 05:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
again in regards to cost Effectiveness
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
in Chiropractic is very minimal
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we've proven that we've brought
 
05:48:13.490 --> 05:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
those study to this to this committee
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
numerous times
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
um to answer your question in regards to
 
05:48:19.010 --> 05:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
as a health care professional
 
05:48:21.048 --> 05:48:21.058 align:start position:0%
it is our responsibility but I know a
 
05:48:22.730 --> 05:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
lot of Health Care Professionals that
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't exercise in a daily basis
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I've watched what they've what they
 
05:48:30.048 --> 05:48:30.058 align:start position:0%
eat and I watch how they don't get sleep
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
and meditate and be mindful and take
 
05:48:34.970 --> 05:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
care of themselves and stretch and
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
so again goes back to the question how
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
do people know
 
05:48:42.288 --> 05:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
some of the Physicians don't even know
 
05:48:44.990 --> 05:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know and it it takes it's it's a
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
journey really I think for most and
 
05:48:48.650 --> 05:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
you've got to figure out what works for
 
05:48:50.090 --> 05:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
you and what doesn't work for you as an
 
05:48:50.100 --> 05:48:53.628 align:start position:0%
you and what doesn't work for you as an
individual

05:48:53.628 --> 05:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you and I
 
05:48:58.730 --> 05:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
I so would you believe I think that some
 
05:49:01.490 --> 05:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
of this starts in medical school
 
05:49:03.770 --> 05:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
um that I think a lot of physicians in
 
05:49:05.208 --> 05:49:05.218 align:start position:0%
training and other people in the medical
 
05:49:07.250 --> 05:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
profession are not
 
05:49:09.590 --> 05:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
um given information they're not trained
 
05:49:11.810 --> 05:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
in these other methodologies and
 
05:49:13.788 --> 05:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
treatments so they don't they don't know
 
05:49:17.030 --> 05:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
about them my husband is 72 years old is
 
05:49:18.470 --> 05:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
a physician
 
05:49:20.330 --> 05:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
um he couldn't get a class of nutrition
 
05:49:22.610 --> 05:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
back in the day so I think some of that
 
05:49:25.250 --> 05:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
falls on on educating these people who
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
are in the profession to do that yeah I
 
05:49:30.048 --> 05:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
believe that too but in Chiropractic
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
College we didn't learn about meditation
 
05:49:34.128 --> 05:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
yet I practice it every day you know we
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
didn't learn about well we did learn
 
05:49:37.610 --> 05:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
about nutrition that actually learned a
 
05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
lot about it but
 
05:49:40.490 --> 05:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
um not as quite as well as I own it
 
05:49:40.500 --> 05:49:41.390 align:start position:0%
um not as quite as well as I own it
today

05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:49:43.850 --> 05:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
you know so I think this still is still
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
a lot missing in education that could be
 
05:49:45.840 --> 05:49:47.390 align:start position:0%
a lot missing in education that could be
improved

05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
improved
 
05:49:47.400 --> 05:49:48.048 align:start position:0%
improved
um

05:49:48.048 --> 05:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:48.058 --> 05:49:49.250 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:49:49.250 --> 05:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:49:51.650 --> 05:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
if we can help our patients and
 
05:49:53.448 --> 05:49:53.458 align:start position:0%
constituents and yourselves and
 
05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
everybody's sitting behind me make
 
05:49:56.930 --> 05:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
better choices
 
05:50:00.410 --> 05:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
to hopefully stay out of a system
 
05:50:03.410 --> 05:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
right that doesn't promote health and
 
05:50:03.420 --> 05:50:04.670 align:start position:0%
right that doesn't promote health and
well-being

05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
05:50:09.288 --> 05:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:17.570 --> 05:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:21.128 --> 05:50:21.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:24.410 --> 05:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for um the chance to speak
 
05:50:25.850 --> 05:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
briefly here
 
05:50:25.860 --> 05:50:28.070 align:start position:0%
briefly here
um

05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:30.350 --> 05:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
just making sure I'm muted I'm Sabrina
 
05:50:31.730 --> 05:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
Dunlap I'm director of government
 
05:50:35.930 --> 05:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
relations for anthem and I missed what
 
05:50:38.628 --> 05:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim had to say I'm guessing
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we Echo a lot of
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
um what Peter said certainly Echo a lot
 
05:50:45.410 --> 05:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
of what Heidi said I did want to just
 
05:50:49.490 --> 05:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we were among the people
 
05:50:51.170 --> 05:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
at the table for the like ad hoc
 
05:50:51.180 --> 05:50:52.788 align:start position:0%
at the table for the like ad hoc
committee

05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:50:54.730 --> 05:50:54.740 align:start position:0%
um we're certainly open to conversation
 
05:50:56.570 --> 05:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
we cover
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of services that are in the realm
 
05:51:01.850 --> 05:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
of pain management I think the licensing
 
05:51:03.890 --> 05:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
piece is key it's just a practical
 
05:51:06.350 --> 05:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
problem that if you have a provider
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's not licensed there's no way to
 
05:51:11.930 --> 05:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
really credential them and sort of bring
 
05:51:14.208 --> 05:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
them under Clinical Services so it's not
 
05:51:16.250 --> 05:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we're you know philosophically
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
opposed it's more of a practical issue
 
05:51:18.120 --> 05:51:19.490 align:start position:0%
opposed it's more of a practical issue
so

05:51:19.490 --> 05:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:22.128 --> 05:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to flag that and we do have
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
the board certified requirement in our
 
05:51:24.958 --> 05:51:33.170 align:start position:0%
the board certified requirement in our
statute

05:51:33.170 --> 05:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:36.048 --> 05:51:36.058 align:start position:0%
so so yeah and just to reiterate we do
 
05:51:38.750 --> 05:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
cover Chiropractic Services osteopathic
 
05:51:42.410 --> 05:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
manipulative treatment acupuncture OTP
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
um it's really when you get into yoga
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
Qigong Tai Chi and meditation
 
05:51:48.770 --> 05:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
um that those things are sort of outside
 
05:51:51.470 --> 05:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
the clinical realm at this point so
 
05:51:51.480 --> 05:51:52.368 align:start position:0%
the clinical realm at this point so
um

05:51:52.368 --> 05:51:52.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's all I have I'm happy to
 
05:51:56.448 --> 05:51:56.458 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I'm sorry I'm
 
05:51:56.458 --> 05:52:01.250 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I'm sorry I'm
rushed

05:52:01.250 --> 05:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.890 --> 05:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay you might want to chance to ask
 
05:52:03.900 --> 05:52:04.990 align:start position:0%
okay you might want to chance to ask

05:53:09.770 --> 05:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
bill because since the
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
um early 1980s I have been working to
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
try and integrate care and provide
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
multi-modal care of people with chronic
 
05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
pain and uh and sometimes with
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
co-occurring addictive disorders
 
05:53:24.650 --> 05:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
including opioid use disorder I have
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
served as director of an outpatient pain
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
service in an academic center I've been
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
privileged to work in the VA system for
 
05:53:34.548 --> 05:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
was privileged to work for 14 years and
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
I had been medical director of a
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
residential treatment center that
 
05:53:40.868 --> 05:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
actually was able to implement
 
05:53:43.610 --> 05:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
multimodal intensive integrative care
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
and see patients come off of opioids and
 
05:53:48.890 --> 05:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
in fact all medications and manage their
 
05:53:48.900 --> 05:53:49.788 align:start position:0%
in fact all medications and manage their
pain

05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
pain
 
05:53:51.708 --> 05:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
um through active Lifestyle Changes
 
05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
including medication meditation exercise
 
05:53:58.730 --> 05:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
and other modalities so I've had a lot
 
05:54:00.410 --> 05:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
of different perspectives on this and
 
05:54:02.448 --> 05:54:02.458 align:start position:0%
it's from that that I I really do
 
05:54:05.330 --> 05:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
support this work I've also had an
 
05:54:07.250 --> 05:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve as president of the
 
05:54:09.610 --> 05:54:09.620 align:start position:0%
American pain society which has been an
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary society that brings
 
05:54:14.208 --> 05:54:14.218 align:start position:0%
together people from different
 
05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
perspectives to treat pain and been in
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
advocacy for this
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill if it's passed
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm pleased to hear that most of the
 
05:54:25.490 --> 05:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying on behalf of
 
05:54:28.128 --> 05:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
it even the insurers like the spirit of
 
05:54:30.410 --> 05:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
the bill but it's the details that are
 
05:54:34.128 --> 05:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
hard to work out but from my perspective
 
05:54:36.650 --> 05:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
if this bill class it will markedly
 
05:54:38.330 --> 05:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
improve quality of life for people with
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
pain it will reduce Reliance and opioids
 
05:54:43.250 --> 05:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
for the treatment of pain and I believe
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
that it will likely actually reduce
 
05:54:48.530 --> 05:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
costs over the long run particularly for
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
people with chronic pain and why would
 
05:54:53.208 --> 05:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
that happen well
 
05:54:57.470 --> 05:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
um if we understand what pain is pain
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's acute such as surgical pain
 
05:55:02.570 --> 05:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
or that associated with medical
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
illnesses or severe trauma whether it's
 
05:55:08.030 --> 05:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
acute pain or whether it's chronic pain
 
05:55:10.190 --> 05:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
due to Chronic conditions that perk
 
05:55:12.830 --> 05:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
along or sometimes chronic pain we can't
 
05:55:16.850 --> 05:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
identify the cause of the the pain the
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
the tissue cause of the pain what
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the pain is it is an experience
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
and it's shaped by very diverse
 
05:55:27.470 --> 05:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
biological factors by environmental
 
05:55:29.570 --> 05:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
factors psychological factors and social
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
factors so whatever the originating
 
05:55:35.410 --> 05:55:35.420 align:start position:0%
cause usually in the tissue somewhere
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
that signal of of injury is sent through
 
05:55:42.470 --> 05:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
the nervous system and it can be either
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
Amplified or it can be turned down or
 
05:55:49.128 --> 05:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
inhibited at many points along the way
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
depending upon the chemical environment
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the body what drugs are present what
 
05:55:56.570 --> 05:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
levels of certain Natural Body chemicals
 
05:55:59.208 --> 05:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
like epinephrine or other other factors
 
05:56:01.250 --> 05:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
are present it can be changed as it
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
travels through the brain by Thoughts by
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
Feelings by cognitions and then it
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
arrives that the brain is either very
 
05:56:10.670 --> 05:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
severe or negligible depending upon how
 
05:56:12.288 --> 05:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
it's been processed by the nervous
 
05:56:14.890 --> 05:56:14.900 align:start position:0%
system and that's why we talk about
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
understanding the pain and and
 
05:56:21.048 --> 05:56:21.058 align:start position:0%
active role in managing the pain because
 
05:56:22.910 --> 05:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
there are things that individuals can do
 
05:56:25.850 --> 05:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
to really change completely the nature
 
05:56:26.890 --> 05:56:26.900 align:start position:0%
of pain
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we know that some people who have
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
serious tissue injury major trauma
 
05:56:35.448 --> 05:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
surgical recovering from major surgeries
 
05:56:37.850 --> 05:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes have little or no pain and
 
05:56:40.128 --> 05:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
other people where we can't even find a
 
05:56:41.930 --> 05:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
reason for the pain may experience
 
05:56:43.850 --> 05:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
enormous pain and people who have
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
chronic pain it may vary from day to day
 
05:56:48.288 --> 05:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
again depending upon contextual areas
 
05:56:51.670 --> 05:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
how they're feeling and what behaviors
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're engaged in so these diverse the
 
05:56:59.048 --> 05:56:59.058 align:start position:0%
diversity of
 
05:57:01.730 --> 05:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
Shapers of pain contributors to pain
 
05:57:04.368 --> 05:57:04.378 align:start position:0%
mean that in order to have an effective
 
05:57:06.410 --> 05:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
pain treatment plan we really have to
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
help understand the contributors to that
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
experience of pain and then have a
 
05:57:14.170 --> 05:57:14.180 align:start position:0%
really broad array of
 
05:57:18.410 --> 05:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
tools that we can use for tailoring our
 
05:57:20.330 --> 05:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
pain management pen to the particular
 
05:57:23.330 --> 05:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
individual I usually think of our Tools
 
05:57:25.250 --> 05:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
in large buckets and I think you've
 
05:57:26.410 --> 05:57:26.420 align:start position:0%
heard most of these but
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
psycho-behavioral treatments such as
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness
 
05:57:35.390 --> 05:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
there's a new one called pain re oh
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
recalibrating therapy where people
 
05:57:40.128 --> 05:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
actually turn off the signals of pain
 
05:57:42.048 --> 05:57:42.058 align:start position:0%
learn to turn off the signals of pain
 
05:57:44.030 --> 05:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
there are physical approaches that we've
 
05:57:45.890 --> 05:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
heard about physical therapy manual
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
therapies such as Chiropractic
 
05:57:50.208 --> 05:57:50.218 align:start position:0%
osteopathic manipulation and movement
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
therapies we've been discussing and
 
05:57:55.368 --> 05:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
importantly individualized exercise on a
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
regular basis the next third bucket
 
05:58:00.410 --> 05:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
medications and it's not just opioids
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
but diverse classes of medications that
 
05:58:04.190 --> 05:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
can be helpful and then finally the
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
interventionalist procedures which may
 
05:58:08.750 --> 05:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
include injection therapies stimulators
 
05:58:10.910 --> 05:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
and a variety of other things but no
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
single approach is right or even no set
 
05:58:15.530 --> 05:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
of approaches is right for any
 
05:58:17.570 --> 05:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
particular condition in any particular
 
05:58:19.730 --> 05:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
individual it has to be individualized
 
05:58:21.948 --> 05:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
we can't a priori decide what we're
 
05:58:23.810 --> 05:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
going to provide
 
05:58:26.750 --> 05:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
another key element though for chronic
 
05:58:29.590 --> 05:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
pain as for most chronic pain chronic
 
05:58:31.610 --> 05:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
conditions or diseases like
 
05:58:35.330 --> 05:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease or diabetes is
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
engagement in the patient in
 
05:58:38.690 --> 05:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
understanding the contributors to their
 
05:58:42.410 --> 05:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
condition and in having an active role
 
05:58:45.410 --> 05:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
in self-care of the condition this can
 
05:58:47.930 --> 05:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
reduce symptoms it improves function and
 
05:58:51.230 --> 05:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
improves quality of life and improves
 
05:58:53.448 --> 05:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of others treatments
 
05:58:55.730 --> 05:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
so we don't just continue on long term
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
on multiple medications or keep going
 
05:58:59.930 --> 05:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
back for more and more injections to get
 
05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
palliative relief
 
05:59:04.910 --> 05:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
we actually reduce the symptoms and are
 
05:59:07.368 --> 05:59:07.378 align:start position:0%
able to manage the pain over time
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
so historically as you know we've heard
 
05:59:11.330 --> 05:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
over and over today at least in the
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
beginning when I was still here I was
 
05:59:14.690 --> 05:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
hearing insurers readily pay for
 
05:59:16.670 --> 05:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
medications and procedures which are
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
often very expensive and often need to
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
be repeated or ongoing
 
05:59:24.350 --> 05:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
um and for reasons that I've never
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
understood going back to the 1980s it's
 
05:59:30.110 --> 05:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
much easier to get a series of very
 
05:59:31.970 --> 05:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
expensive injections
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
approved than to get 10 sessions of
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy with
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
mindfulness approved by a licensed
 
05:59:43.128 --> 05:59:43.138 align:start position:0%
provider that might obviate the need
 
05:59:45.650 --> 05:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
going forward for as much medication or
 
05:59:49.310 --> 05:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
injections or May in fact lead to no use
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
of these other procedures
 
05:59:52.558 --> 05:59:53.990 align:start position:0%
of these other procedures
so

05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:56.510 --> 05:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I am not persuaded by the insurance
 
05:59:58.670 --> 05:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
company the insurance Department's
 
06:00:02.030 --> 06:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis that says this bill will
 
06:00:04.128 --> 06:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
increase cost just because it makes more
 
06:00:06.850 --> 06:00:06.860 align:start position:0%
treatments available in fact my
 
06:00:09.770 --> 06:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
expectation is that this bill would
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
reduce costs by allowing us more tools
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
to tailor
 
06:00:17.930 --> 06:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
treatment to the individual's needs to
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
help coordinate that care because it
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
does ask for care coordination so that
 
06:00:24.170 --> 06:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's implemented in a way that's most
 
06:00:26.270 --> 06:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
helpful to the individual that we'd stop
 
06:00:28.490 --> 06:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
in wasting Investments on just a limited
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
range of treatments that may be more
 
06:00:32.570 --> 06:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
expensive and maybe less effective for
 
06:00:32.580 --> 06:00:34.548 align:start position:0%
expensive and maybe less effective for
individuals

06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:00:40.430 --> 06:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill will really allow us to
 
06:00:43.610 --> 06:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
implement an effective individualized
 
06:00:45.830 --> 06:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
treatment using a chronic disease
 
06:00:48.890 --> 06:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
management model which study after study
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
after study has shown improve outcomes
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
for across different types of conditions
 
06:00:57.048 --> 06:00:57.058 align:start position:0%
and quality of life for people with
 
06:00:59.230 --> 06:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
chronic illnesses including chronic pain
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
and in many situations they reduce
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
Health Care utilization fewer trips to
 
06:01:08.570 --> 06:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
the ER in crisis or to primary care or
 
06:01:11.770 --> 06:01:11.780 align:start position:0%
to our hospitalizations
 
06:01:16.788 --> 06:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
and less use of ongoing therapies with
 
06:01:20.990 --> 06:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
greater engagement in in self-management
 
06:01:23.090 --> 06:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
of the problem
 
06:01:25.730 --> 06:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
so um this isn't just my perspective
 
06:01:27.530 --> 06:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
virtually every organization that's
 
06:01:30.368 --> 06:01:30.378 align:start position:0%
issued paying guidelines has supported a
 
06:01:33.170 --> 06:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
multi-modal approach uh to paying care
 
06:01:35.448 --> 06:01:35.458 align:start position:0%
that addresses the whole person is quite
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
simply the standard of care as I think
 
06:01:38.930 --> 06:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
you've heard from many of the speakers
 
06:01:42.650 --> 06:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
today and uh I've been doing this for 40
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
years and I'd be really excited to see a
 
06:01:48.530 --> 06:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
change in the way we address pain in our
 
06:01:50.510 --> 06:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
state I think we can do it and I thank
 
06:01:52.368 --> 06:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
you very much and I'm very happy to
 
06:01:54.770 --> 06:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but I think so many
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
have been asked and answered you may
 
06:01:58.930 --> 06:01:58.940 align:start position:0%
have none left yes
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative spear has a question
 
06:02:04.850 --> 06:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
this is a question I've asked already in
 
06:02:08.448 --> 06:02:08.458 align:start position:0%
the in the past in this session and I
 
06:02:11.090 --> 06:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
I've had pain incidences over my
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
lifetime as I'm sure many of us do I was
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
a very Avid jogger and so as a result my
 
06:02:18.288 --> 06:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
hips don't work my knees don't work
 
06:02:20.330 --> 06:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
and I go I've got been to all kinds of
 
06:02:21.890 --> 06:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
doctors and
 
06:02:24.410 --> 06:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
but I have never heard a doctor talk
 
06:02:26.270 --> 06:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
about pain the way I've heard about a
 
06:02:27.530 --> 06:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
talk today
 
06:02:32.390 --> 06:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.628 --> 06:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
why isn't the medical profession pushing
 
06:02:37.610 --> 06:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
this as opposed to some individual
 
06:02:39.230 --> 06:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
doctors but the medical profession
 
06:02:41.930 --> 06:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to push the insurance
 
06:02:44.090 --> 06:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
companies to solve the problem because
 
06:02:46.490 --> 06:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
I've been to more kinds of doctors and
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
they never talk about it like this well
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
all I get is the usual typical stuff and
 
06:02:53.690 --> 06:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
then they give up one of the things that
 
06:02:55.730 --> 06:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
I've already heard I think you say or
 
06:02:58.010 --> 06:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
someone saying this room is education is
 
06:03:00.770 --> 06:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
a real problem we haven't historically
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
had a lot of Education in and on pain as
 
06:03:07.128 --> 06:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
part of Core Medical Training nursing
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
training Pharmacy training or anything
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
else we hear about it the drugs that you
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
use for pain you get it in Pharma
 
06:03:14.750 --> 06:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy but what is pain management
 
06:03:16.670 --> 06:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been
 
06:03:20.090 --> 06:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
um uh a course in itself or a focus in
 
06:03:21.770 --> 06:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
itself you know
 
06:03:24.650 --> 06:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and so that's part of the problem and
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
there is a big move within medical
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
education now to change that as it is
 
06:03:30.410 --> 06:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
for addiction because we also didn't
 
06:03:31.970 --> 06:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
have that that's another thing that
 
06:03:35.030 --> 06:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
we've sorely needed
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is if it can't be
 
06:03:38.990 --> 06:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
paid for we often don't pay attention
 
06:03:40.430 --> 06:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
for it because most of our patients
 
06:03:42.770 --> 06:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
can't afford to self-pay for things so I
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
think even doctors who are aware of the
 
06:03:45.718 --> 06:03:47.570 align:start position:0%
think even doctors who are aware of the
opportunities

06:03:47.570 --> 06:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
06:03:50.270 --> 06:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
um for different approaches to treatment
 
06:03:52.250 --> 06:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
don't know how to get them I think I
 
06:03:55.070 --> 06:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier you know I would be I
 
06:03:57.250 --> 06:03:57.260 align:start position:0%
mean I remember
 
06:04:01.010 --> 06:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
1986 or 7 doing epidurals and saying but
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to last unless I can
 
06:04:06.350 --> 06:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
get this but the effects of this may be
 
06:04:08.510 --> 06:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
helpful but unless I can get this person
 
06:04:10.788 --> 06:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
exercising and managing their stress
 
06:04:12.650 --> 06:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's not going to have any long-term
 
06:04:15.530 --> 06:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
effects but it couldn't get a cognitive
 
06:04:18.350 --> 06:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
behavioral Pain Group group set of group
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
sessions paid for
 
06:04:22.970 --> 06:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
so I think you know we tend to prescribe
 
06:04:25.610 --> 06:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
what we can what is realistic for the
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
patient so I think it's mutual I think
 
06:04:29.330 --> 06:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
it has to be both I agree with you
 
06:04:29.340 --> 06:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
it has to be both I agree with you
entirely

06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
06:04:33.410 --> 06:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:04:35.810 --> 06:04:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much okay thank you
 
06:04:40.910 --> 06:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:42.770 --> 06:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:04:42.780 --> 06:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
um

06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:46.430 --> 06:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
personally this is uh the Prelude to my
 
06:04:49.250 --> 06:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
question uh I find alternative uh
 
06:04:51.770 --> 06:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
therapies uh very helpful
 
06:04:51.780 --> 06:04:52.490 align:start position:0%
therapies uh very helpful
um

06:04:52.490 --> 06:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:52.500 --> 06:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:57.170 --> 06:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
my question goes to the limiting factor
 
06:04:59.090 --> 06:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it seems very open-ended and so let
 
06:05:04.970 --> 06:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
me explain what I mean by that
 
06:05:04.980 --> 06:05:05.868 align:start position:0%
me explain what I mean by that
um

06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:09.410 --> 06:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
the definitional section uh talks about
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral interventions and then it
 
06:05:14.150 --> 06:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
says including but not limited to and
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
then the manual treatments including but
 
06:05:18.048 --> 06:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
not limited to movement therapies
 
06:05:19.850 --> 06:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to so that's
 
06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
very open-ended so I've been to
 
06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
chiropractors that practice uh applied
 
06:05:25.138 --> 06:05:26.830 align:start position:0%
chiropractors that practice uh applied
kinesiology

06:05:26.830 --> 06:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
kinesiology
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
I've been to chiropractors that practice
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
something called one brain therapy
 
06:05:34.368 --> 06:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
which is maybe maybe you've never heard
 
06:05:37.128 --> 06:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
of that I've been to acupuncturists that
 
06:05:37.138 --> 06:05:38.270 align:start position:0%
of that I've been to acupuncturists that
practiced

06:05:38.270 --> 06:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
practiced
 
06:05:41.150 --> 06:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
the nambujra Pod allergy elimination
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
technique that's probably a pretty rare
 
06:05:46.670 --> 06:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
one and then one one therapy that is
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
enlisted here that's helped me in the
 
06:05:49.730 --> 06:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
past is something called the Alexander
 
06:05:49.740 --> 06:05:51.110 align:start position:0%
past is something called the Alexander
technique

06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
technique
 
06:05:54.048 --> 06:05:54.058 align:start position:0%
which isn't listed right so
 
06:05:57.830 --> 06:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
um those were all attempts to experiment
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know if they were going to
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
be successful most of them weren't
 
06:06:04.190 --> 06:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and so if we're going to raise
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
insurance rates by having an open-ended
 
06:06:09.530 --> 06:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
mandate shouldn't the other uh the other
 
06:06:11.690 --> 06:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
people paying into that pool
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
should should have a benefit to it as
 
06:06:15.530 --> 06:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
well right they shouldn't be paying for
 
06:06:16.690 --> 06:06:16.700 align:start position:0%
things that are
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
experimental that may not have any uh
 
06:06:23.330 --> 06:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
efficacy and so again back to the
 
06:06:25.788 --> 06:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
limiting factor question all these
 
06:06:27.650 --> 06:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
including but not limit to statements
 
06:06:30.470 --> 06:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
someone could put up a shingle
 
06:06:32.770 --> 06:06:32.780 align:start position:0%
um that claims to be a pain therapy
 
06:06:36.470 --> 06:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
modality and this spill I think as I
 
06:06:38.448 --> 06:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
read it would mandate that that
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
paint that that uh service would be uh
 
06:06:43.128 --> 06:06:43.138 align:start position:0%
have to be provided for because it's
 
06:06:45.410 --> 06:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
pain therapy so what is the limiting
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
factor how do we determine what
 
06:06:49.548 --> 06:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
something is effective at managing pain
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:57.048 --> 06:06:57.058 align:start position:0%
I believe it says effective
 
06:06:59.390 --> 06:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based therapies
 
06:07:01.490 --> 06:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know we can quibble
 
06:07:03.048 --> 06:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
about what's evidence-based and what's
 
06:07:05.390 --> 06:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
emerging evidence or evidence informed
 
06:07:08.330 --> 06:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
but I think that's where the discussion
 
06:07:10.070 --> 06:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
comes between the insurer and the
 
06:07:12.110 --> 06:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
provider show me that this has shown
 
06:07:15.410 --> 06:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
promise or has evidence and isn't just
 
06:07:18.890 --> 06:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
you know the latest you know let's
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
experiment with this and and people
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't get better I'm sorry I didn't
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
articulate that very well but I think
 
06:07:27.530 --> 06:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
um the discussion needs to be around
 
06:07:27.540 --> 06:07:29.208 align:start position:0%
um the discussion needs to be around
what

06:07:29.208 --> 06:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:07:31.310 --> 06:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
um whether something is evidence-based
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
or not whether it's demonstrated promise
 
06:07:37.730 --> 06:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
of efficacy in the people and be whom
 
06:07:39.170 --> 06:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's being used
 
06:07:39.180 --> 06:07:41.090 align:start position:0%
it's being used
just

06:07:41.090 --> 06:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:07:42.530 --> 06:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
06:07:45.170 --> 06:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
so so if it's a mandate uh that we're
 
06:07:47.390 --> 06:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
talking about here that we would need to
 
06:07:50.868 --> 06:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
Define that in the legislation would you
 
06:07:50.878 --> 06:07:51.770 align:start position:0%
Define that in the legislation would you
agree

06:07:51.770 --> 06:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
agree
 
06:07:54.288 --> 06:07:54.298 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
06:07:56.570 --> 06:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
I think
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
what level of evidence has to be present
 
06:08:01.250 --> 06:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
to call something evidence-based is open
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
to discussion I'm not sure that the
 
06:08:06.770 --> 06:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
legislature can Define that I think that
 
06:08:09.708 --> 06:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
might be a discussion for clinicians or
 
06:08:11.810 --> 06:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
for the insurance department or for
 
06:08:11.820 --> 06:08:13.310 align:start position:0%
for the insurance department or for
others

06:08:13.310 --> 06:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
others
 
06:08:17.090 --> 06:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
um who who look at evidence
 
06:08:18.770 --> 06:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
um but I'll give you an example it's
 
06:08:20.750 --> 06:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
interesting one of the things that isn't
 
06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned in here is that emerging pain
 
06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
treatment that I mentioned and Dave you
 
06:08:28.030 --> 06:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
may know the name of it but it's um pain
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
restructuring therapy or it's changing
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
cognition so that at the neurologic
 
06:08:35.448 --> 06:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
level you can block the pain with your
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
brain there's a new therapy out it has
 
06:08:40.910 --> 06:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
now four or five papers supporting its
 
06:08:40.920 --> 06:08:42.170 align:start position:0%
now four or five papers supporting its
use

06:08:42.170 --> 06:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
um and they're more larger trials
 
06:08:47.090 --> 06:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
underway whether that would yet be
 
06:08:49.070 --> 06:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
considered evidence-based I'm not 100
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure that's open to discussion but
 
06:08:54.048 --> 06:08:54.058 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that might five
 
06:08:56.330 --> 06:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
years from now be named in here but it
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
isn't yet because it's an emerging
 
06:09:02.208 --> 06:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
therapy with promise of efficacy do you
 
06:09:02.218 --> 06:09:03.788 align:start position:0%
therapy with promise of efficacy do you
see

06:09:03.788 --> 06:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:09:06.110 --> 06:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
but I agree with you you can't pay for
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
everything you need to have some
 
06:09:10.430 --> 06:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
evidence that it's helpful
 
06:09:10.440 --> 06:09:11.810 align:start position:0%
evidence that it's helpful
okay

06:09:11.810 --> 06:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:09:14.810 --> 06:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you I have two more cards yet left
 
06:09:17.810 --> 06:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
06:09:20.390 --> 06:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
well uh usually what I do is at the end
 
06:09:23.330 --> 06:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'll let you come up and clean up
 
06:09:37.610 --> 06:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon
 
06:09:44.090 --> 06:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to have a few
 
06:09:46.190 --> 06:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
moments to speak and I appreciate the
 
06:09:47.510 --> 06:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
fact that you guys have been sitting
 
06:09:50.628 --> 06:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
here all afternoon and dealing with many
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
many bills
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the reason I am here is going to
 
06:09:58.430 --> 06:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
probably sound like a unique and
 
06:10:00.350 --> 06:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
interesting one and probably one that
 
06:10:04.910 --> 06:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
you didn't expect but I appreciate all
 
06:10:06.770 --> 06:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
of the work that has been done on this
 
06:10:09.230 --> 06:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill I believe that this is an
 
06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the State of New
 
06:10:14.750 --> 06:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to start small and work up to
 
06:10:19.610 --> 06:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
actually covering a larger variety of
 
06:10:22.490 --> 06:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
groups and categories by starting with
 
06:10:23.470 --> 06:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
this Bill
 
06:10:25.970 --> 06:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm here because
 
06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was not brought
 
06:10:31.250 --> 06:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
up in this bill and one of the groups
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
that was not consulted or considered
 
06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
while drafting this bill is the
 
06:10:39.048 --> 06:10:39.058 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis community of the
 
06:10:42.410 --> 06:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire we currently have
 
06:10:45.890 --> 06:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
over 12 000 patients I believe actually
 
06:10:49.730 --> 06:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's closer to 14 000 plus now and out
 
06:10:52.970 --> 06:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
of that 70 percent of those patients are
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually on the program for pain chronic
 
06:11:03.288 --> 06:11:03.298 align:start position:0%
pain related issues of that we have 50
 
06:11:06.430 --> 06:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
percent uh 70 percent
 
06:11:08.448 --> 06:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
are for
 
06:11:11.810 --> 06:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
severe pain 50 are for chronic pain and
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
20 are for other degrees of severe pain
 
06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
in magnitude uh this bill should be
 
06:11:24.610 --> 06:11:24.620 align:start position:0%
amended to include therapeutic cannabis
 
06:11:27.490 --> 06:11:27.500 align:start position:0%
has an alternative treatment
 
06:11:30.730 --> 06:11:30.740 align:start position:0%
whether that be in regards to
 
06:11:35.150 --> 06:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
individuals getting the
 
06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
plant access to the plant that they need
 
06:11:40.970 --> 06:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
or whether that be having appointments
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis covered in the
 
06:11:46.850 --> 06:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
state currently this is not covered At
 
06:11:49.250 --> 06:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
All by insurance this is an
 
06:11:53.330 --> 06:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket cost that can be
 
06:11:57.288 --> 06:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
it's huge for patients
 
06:11:59.208 --> 06:11:59.218 align:start position:0%
um you know you you are looking at
 
06:12:00.770 --> 06:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
anywhere from
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollars a year to over
 
06:12:05.930 --> 06:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars a year out
 
06:12:09.770 --> 06:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
of pocket depending on the severity of
 
06:12:12.048 --> 06:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
your condition and what it is you
 
06:12:16.368 --> 06:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
require in order to successfully
 
06:12:21.610 --> 06:12:21.620 align:start position:0%
integrate back into a healthy lifestyle
 
06:12:27.250 --> 06:12:27.260 align:start position:0%
this has a direct impact on individuals
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times patients are left
 
06:12:34.910 --> 06:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
having to make decisions on whether they
 
06:12:37.250 --> 06:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
treat their health or whether they're or
 
06:12:39.368 --> 06:12:39.378 align:start position:0%
not they pay their bills
 
06:12:41.810 --> 06:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:12:45.410 --> 06:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
I've I've gone through this myself
 
06:12:47.708 --> 06:12:47.718 align:start position:0%
um you know what what good is it for me
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
to you know be able to pay this bill if
 
06:12:55.070 --> 06:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
on my will say my car what good is it
 
06:12:57.230 --> 06:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
for me to pay the insurance and pay the
 
06:12:59.510 --> 06:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance on my vehicle if I'm not
 
06:13:01.910 --> 06:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
physically capable of driving that
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle because I can't afford the
 
06:13:08.750 --> 06:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
medication that I need each month that
 
06:13:11.930 --> 06:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
allows my body to function
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we see a lot of individuals
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
that are put in those situations I
 
06:13:20.090 --> 06:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
realize that this bill does not cover a
 
06:13:22.670 --> 06:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
huge group of individuals in the state
 
06:13:26.410 --> 06:13:26.420 align:start position:0%
but as I seated this is an opportunity
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
to start small and hopefully create a
 
06:13:34.490 --> 06:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
trend that we see graduate to cover more
 
06:13:36.530 --> 06:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
and more individuals throughout the
 
06:13:39.650 --> 06:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
state I don't see this as being a huge
 
06:13:43.548 --> 06:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
issue in regards to how we cover it or
 
06:13:46.250 --> 06:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
how an insurance company deals with it
 
06:13:48.910 --> 06:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
because fortunately
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis has probably some
 
06:13:54.530 --> 06:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the strictest regulations in the
 
06:13:56.690 --> 06:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as far as how the
 
06:13:59.930 --> 06:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
program is run and operated which would
 
06:14:02.930 --> 06:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
make it extremely easy to work with
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies in order to be able
 
06:14:09.230 --> 06:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
to help patients and to get coverage
 
06:14:11.230 --> 06:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
that they need for this
 
06:14:15.288 --> 06:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
I realized that there is still a lot of
 
06:14:19.368 --> 06:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
stigma and even discrimination in
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
regards to therapeutic cannabis use in
 
06:14:25.910 --> 06:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state but that needs to not be an
 
06:14:28.610 --> 06:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
issue right now just because a person
 
06:14:31.490 --> 06:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
chooses an alternative method for health
 
06:14:34.250 --> 06:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
care they should not be discriminated
 
06:14:37.250 --> 06:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
against having coverage for their health
 
06:14:40.128 --> 06:14:40.138 align:start position:0%
care choices and leaving therapeutic
 
06:14:42.530 --> 06:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis off of this bill
 
06:14:44.810 --> 06:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
does that
 
06:14:48.048 --> 06:14:48.058 align:start position:0%
um I have had the pleasure to sit on the
 
06:14:50.208 --> 06:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
06:14:52.730 --> 06:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
board as the patient representative for
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire we have had a
 
06:14:57.948 --> 06:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
listening session we have spoken to
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
patients we have spoken with
 
06:15:03.470 --> 06:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries we have you know gone above
 
06:15:06.470 --> 06:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
and beyond in trying to find out what it
 
06:15:10.368 --> 06:15:10.378 align:start position:0%
is our patients need and the number one
 
06:15:13.490 --> 06:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
issue that is always raised is
 
06:15:13.500 --> 06:15:14.948 align:start position:0%
issue that is always raised is
affordability

06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
this bill if therapeutic cannabis is
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
added to it allows the beginning of that
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
to start taking place so that more and
 
06:15:28.910 --> 06:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
more individuals can receive some sort
 
06:15:32.270 --> 06:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
of financial relief they can pursue
 
06:15:36.048 --> 06:15:36.058 align:start position:0%
their quality of life and they can have
 
06:15:38.288 --> 06:15:38.298 align:start position:0%
control over their health care
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
I have not unfortunately
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
had very good luck when it comes with my
 
06:15:47.208 --> 06:15:47.218 align:start position:0%
own health care and using modern
 
06:15:51.070 --> 06:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
medications and modern medicine
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
I was very lucky to be introduced to
 
06:15:58.670 --> 06:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and as a result I
 
06:16:02.448 --> 06:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
walked in this room by myself I can sit
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
here and speak to all of you and address
 
06:16:06.350 --> 06:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
06:16:10.190 --> 06:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
and I can take care of my children and
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
my family before I found therapeutic
 
06:16:15.530 --> 06:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis the only options I was given
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
were opioids or surgery that had a very
 
06:16:22.788 --> 06:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
high chance of leaving me in even worse
 
06:16:26.090 --> 06:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
conditions than what I already was I had
 
06:16:28.910 --> 06:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
to use canes sometimes I couldn't even
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
pull myself up to walk
 
06:16:36.350 --> 06:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
I I don't necessarily hold that against
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
the medical professionals but I do think
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies and medical
 
06:16:45.230 --> 06:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
professionals sometimes maybe tie their
 
06:16:48.070 --> 06:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
own hands when it comes to exploring
 
06:16:51.350 --> 06:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment options for their
 
06:16:51.360 --> 06:16:52.510 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment options for their
patients

06:16:52.510 --> 06:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
patients
 
06:16:55.970 --> 06:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know I am very fortunate to live a
 
06:16:59.208 --> 06:16:59.218 align:start position:0%
much better lifestyle than I did I wish
 
06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
that there were more options for
 
06:17:06.948 --> 06:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
a patient to be able to have some sort
 
06:17:09.650 --> 06:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
of financial relief and I would really
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
like this committee to take that
 
06:17:14.810 --> 06:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make a change to do
 
06:17:17.628 --> 06:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
something as a first and to amend this
 
06:17:24.890 --> 06:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:26.510 --> 06:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
06:17:28.730 --> 06:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'll admit I just looked this
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
up but um I think one of the problems
 
06:17:33.350 --> 06:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we may have at the state level is
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that this is still a schedule one drug
 
06:17:38.930 --> 06:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
at the federal level and which may make
 
06:17:43.128 --> 06:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
it very difficult for any state to um to
 
06:17:45.530 --> 06:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
allow insurance to cover it so that
 
06:17:47.150 --> 06:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
might might have to be dealt with it
 
06:17:50.990 --> 06:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
there before we can we can do that
 
06:17:54.110 --> 06:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
and to that I would respond with that
 
06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
there has been a memo that has been
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
issued for several years even during the
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Trump Administration even during the
 
06:18:06.530 --> 06:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration that says a state
 
06:18:10.430 --> 06:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
is allowed to do as they choose in
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
regards to therapeutic cannabis and that
 
06:18:17.090 --> 06:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
the federal government will not stand in
 
06:18:18.190 --> 06:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
their way
 
06:18:22.548 --> 06:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
and this is an opportunity we do not
 
06:18:25.850 --> 06:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
have the federal government storming New
 
06:18:25.860 --> 06:18:27.048 align:start position:0%
have the federal government storming New
Hampshire

06:18:27.048 --> 06:18:27.058 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:18:30.170 --> 06:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
and reading our dispensaries or
 
06:18:32.448 --> 06:18:32.458 align:start position:0%
incarcerating our patients
 
06:18:35.390 --> 06:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
you know this is an opportunity to do
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
something in regards
 
06:18:39.948 --> 06:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
to making a change
 
06:18:42.470 --> 06:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up please for the question you
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
mean Claire yeah and you know I I'm
 
06:18:46.430 --> 06:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
actually all in favor of of
 
06:18:48.288 --> 06:18:48.298 align:start position:0%
um insurance coverage
 
06:18:50.448 --> 06:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
um this just so you know but I I think
 
06:18:52.910 --> 06:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
it would be worthy to find out why
 
06:18:54.530 --> 06:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
um despite the fact that it's legal in
 
06:18:56.868 --> 06:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
37 states that insurance is not covering
 
06:18:58.670 --> 06:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
it I think that might be the next step
 
06:19:03.010 --> 06:19:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:04.930 --> 06:19:04.940 align:start position:0%
who knows
 
06:19:07.730 --> 06:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
the world of marijuana is uh
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
who knows how far they're gonna let us
 
06:19:10.080 --> 06:19:11.390 align:start position:0%
who knows how far they're gonna let us
go

06:19:11.390 --> 06:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
go
 
06:19:13.448 --> 06:19:13.458 align:start position:0%
get any other questions
 
06:19:18.048 --> 06:19:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:21.230 --> 06:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
Vicki Irwin
 
06:19:37.670 --> 06:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:39.708 --> 06:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll go with last but not least
 
06:19:42.048 --> 06:19:42.058 align:start position:0%
that's it all right I won't keep you
 
06:19:44.208 --> 06:19:44.218 align:start position:0%
long um as you said my name is Vicki
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
Irwin I am a licensed acupuncturist here
 
06:19:47.930 --> 06:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I am a
 
06:19:49.548 --> 06:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire acupuncture
 
06:19:51.170 --> 06:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
and Asian medicine Association although
 
06:19:54.048 --> 06:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
I am not representing them today and I'm
 
06:19:56.990 --> 06:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
also the new chairperson for the back um
 
06:19:59.868 --> 06:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
Board of acupuncture licensing so I kind
 
06:20:03.350 --> 06:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
of wanted to introduce myself as a put
 
06:20:05.570 --> 06:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
some names with some faces and I'd love
 
06:20:07.010 --> 06:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
to be a sounding board for folks later
 
06:20:08.930 --> 06:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
although technically today I am
 
06:20:10.670 --> 06:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
testifying as a professional not on
 
06:20:13.190 --> 06:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the licensing board
 
06:20:14.330 --> 06:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
um but I did want to take a moment to
 
06:20:15.890 --> 06:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank all of you for listening all day
 
06:20:17.390 --> 06:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
today and to the committee members that
 
06:20:19.128 --> 06:20:19.138 align:start position:0%
had worked so hard behind the scenes to
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
put this bill together my predecessor
 
06:20:23.690 --> 06:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
Cindy tyrogetti tried to bring me up to
 
06:20:27.048 --> 06:20:27.058 align:start position:0%
speed on this as well as hb66 which is
 
06:20:28.910 --> 06:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
not today's topic of discussion but
 
06:20:31.070 --> 06:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
something I'm excited to see coming down
 
06:20:32.810 --> 06:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
the line as well
 
06:20:34.850 --> 06:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm excited to see this bill to come
 
06:20:36.230 --> 06:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
together I do own and operate
 
06:20:37.548 --> 06:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
Acupuncture Center of Southern New
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire out of Nashua New Hampshire
 
06:20:41.150 --> 06:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I perform better than 1700
 
06:20:44.150 --> 06:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
treatments a year most of these are on
 
06:20:47.030 --> 06:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
folks with chronic pain a handful of
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
them are actually recovering addicts
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
that are just looking for an alternative
 
06:20:52.128 --> 06:20:52.138 align:start position:0%
to their an alternative to pain
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
medications unfortunately so many of
 
06:20:56.030 --> 06:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
those folks are lacking adequate
 
06:20:58.368 --> 06:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for Alternatives like
 
06:20:58.378 --> 06:20:59.810 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for Alternatives like
myself

06:20:59.810 --> 06:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:21:01.368 --> 06:21:01.378 align:start position:0%
um but I do direct Bill insurance
 
06:21:03.770 --> 06:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
companies whenever I can the vast
 
06:21:05.390 --> 06:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
majority of my practice is in fact
 
06:21:08.628 --> 06:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh billing
 
06:21:10.610 --> 06:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I have a small handful of prompt pay
 
06:21:13.010 --> 06:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
folks or or self-pay folks and I enjoy
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeing them but uh insurance is the bulk
 
06:21:18.170 --> 06:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
of my business while I'm grateful to see
 
06:21:19.730 --> 06:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
a growing number of insurance policies
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
that do offer some acupuncture benefits
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
I watch my patients carefully budgeting
 
06:21:25.850 --> 06:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
their visits or their units that they're
 
06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
allowed for the year to try to stretch
 
06:21:30.650 --> 06:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
them out over the course of the year
 
06:21:33.110 --> 06:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I really think they're um lifestyle
 
06:21:35.270 --> 06:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
or quality of life would be greatly
 
06:21:37.128 --> 06:21:37.138 align:start position:0%
improved even by adding just a few
 
06:21:38.750 --> 06:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
additional visits per year like the 20
 
06:21:41.448 --> 06:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
that this bill is asking for a lot of my
 
06:21:43.850 --> 06:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
folks have kind of in the 10 to 12 range
 
06:21:45.230 --> 06:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
I can usually get them feeling a whole
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
lot better but then they drop off
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
because they've run out of benefits and
 
06:21:50.570 --> 06:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
a year later their back saying so I was
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
feeling great but now I don't
 
06:21:54.350 --> 06:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
and we're sort of starting over from
 
06:21:56.930 --> 06:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
scratch in a manner of speaking I
 
06:21:58.430 --> 06:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually think allowing a few extra
 
06:22:00.048 --> 06:22:00.058 align:start position:0%
visits with me would be much more
 
06:22:01.730 --> 06:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
advantageous to the insurance companies
 
06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
then sending them to somebody like our
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
colleague Dr Nagel
 
06:22:07.970 --> 06:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
a 3 500 shot for heaven's sakes you
 
06:22:11.930 --> 06:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
um the average amount that I built out
 
06:22:15.650 --> 06:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
for two sets of needles is 117 for a one
 
06:22:17.150 --> 06:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
hour visit
 
06:22:19.850 --> 06:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of shots
 
06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
um at any rate
 
06:22:21.600 --> 06:22:22.190 align:start position:0%
um at any rate
um

06:22:22.190 --> 06:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:24.350 --> 06:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
I do believe that increasing the
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
coverage and a nice multimodal approach
 
06:22:28.970 --> 06:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
like this bill is calling for uh would
 
06:22:31.128 --> 06:22:31.138 align:start position:0%
benefit individuals in pain a great deal
 
06:22:32.570 --> 06:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
and also has the potential to decrease
 
06:22:34.430 --> 06:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
the burden of opioid addiction that the
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
state is currently condemning with so I
 
06:22:38.510 --> 06:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I'm happy to
 
06:22:44.150 --> 06:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:46.490 --> 06:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
I guess we're all questioned out I guess
 
06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you thank you
 
06:22:52.788 --> 06:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
okay representative you can wrap it up
 
06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:04.670 --> 06:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
right because that's that's really yeah
 
06:23:06.288 --> 06:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
gonna turn your mic on
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
because that is the reasoning I mean uh
 
06:23:12.048 --> 06:23:12.058 align:start position:0%
in terms of we actually even have
 
06:23:13.910 --> 06:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
another requirement that you have to be
 
06:23:15.770 --> 06:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know board certified but then we
 
06:23:18.288 --> 06:23:18.298 align:start position:0%
back off on that when we go so I I'm not
 
06:23:20.270 --> 06:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm not gonna challenge you by
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
asking you what your understanding of
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine is but I uh in
 
06:23:26.810 --> 06:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
my book there's a subsection called
 
06:23:28.730 --> 06:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Edison myths and
 
06:23:30.530 --> 06:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
realities because when I started looking
 
06:23:32.570 --> 06:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
at it I didn't I it turned out I didn't
 
06:23:34.368 --> 06:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
have a clue what it was so I went on
 
06:23:36.770 --> 06:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
asked my colleagues and I the number of
 
06:23:38.270 --> 06:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
doctors who actually knew what
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine is was like
 
06:23:43.250 --> 06:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
close to zero and and so I don't expect
 
06:23:45.770 --> 06:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
the insurers to be any better but what
 
06:23:48.410 --> 06:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
what what it is it's the use of the
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
entire body of the medical literature is
 
06:23:53.690 --> 06:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
applied to the individual circumstances
 
06:23:55.730 --> 06:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
of a patient so we're getting back to
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
this patient-centered thing a couple
 
06:24:00.288 --> 06:24:00.298 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a gentleman who
 
06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
apparently had nothing better to do than
 
06:24:03.470 --> 06:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
he looked at a thousand medical
 
06:24:05.208 --> 06:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
questions that were in the Cochrane
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
collection which is the largest
 
06:24:08.090 --> 06:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
collection of evidence based in the
 
06:24:10.730 --> 06:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
world on medical questions he found out
 
06:24:12.530 --> 06:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
that only three percent of medical
 
06:24:15.708 --> 06:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
questions were answered beyond a shadow
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
of a doubt which means 97 percent of the
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
questions in medicine are not answered
 
06:24:20.400 --> 06:24:21.590 align:start position:0%
questions in medicine are not answered
sufficiently

06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
my concern is this and we brought this
 
06:24:25.730 --> 06:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
up at the ad hoc group when that issue
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
came up before I don't mind using the
 
06:24:30.470 --> 06:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
evidence we have to try to do the best
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
we can to say what works and what
 
06:24:34.250 --> 06:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't but what I do demand is that we
 
06:24:36.170 --> 06:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
use a Level Playing Field in doing that
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:24:40.970 --> 06:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
surgeons use pedicle screws on a regular
 
06:24:43.128 --> 06:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
basis to do spinal fusions there is
 
06:24:45.288 --> 06:24:45.298 align:start position:0%
virtually no evidence to support that
 
06:24:46.850 --> 06:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
practice for the in the degenerative
 
06:24:49.730 --> 06:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
spine at all I hate to imagine how much
 
06:24:51.830 --> 06:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
money we spend every year to pay for
 
06:24:51.840 --> 06:24:52.670 align:start position:0%
money we spend every year to pay for
that

06:24:52.670 --> 06:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:55.490 --> 06:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
but then when we have uh the ACT there's
 
06:24:57.470 --> 06:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
a blanket on the name of it there's an
 
06:24:58.970 --> 06:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
acupuncture thing that looked at the
 
06:25:01.610 --> 06:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
evidence on 107 acupuncture 117
 
06:25:04.368 --> 06:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
conditions and found that it was valid
 
06:25:05.930 --> 06:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
for that well when they were struggling
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
to to approve that we're not dealing
 
06:25:09.708 --> 06:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
with a Level Playing Field so all I want
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
the insurers to do is say you know what
 
06:25:13.788 --> 06:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to use the same system of
 
06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
analysis for acupuncture chiropractic
 
06:25:18.170 --> 06:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
massage which are all done by licensed
 
06:25:19.970 --> 06:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
therapists as we would for a spinal
 
06:25:21.890 --> 06:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
surging doing
 
06:25:21.900 --> 06:25:22.730 align:start position:0%
surging doing
um

06:25:22.730 --> 06:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:25.310 --> 06:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know a pedicle screw fixation or me
 
06:25:28.128 --> 06:25:28.138 align:start position:0%
Dave Nagel doing one of his 63 000
 
06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
epidurals which for example there is
 
06:25:31.970 --> 06:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
virtually no evidence to support any
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
long-term efficacy of an epidural
 
06:25:36.530 --> 06:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
steroid injection unless you combine it
 
06:25:38.390 --> 06:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
with another modality the only paper
 
06:25:41.090 --> 06:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
that ever showed efficacy was in 1998
 
06:25:44.510 --> 06:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
and they used epidural injections with a
 
06:25:46.368 --> 06:25:46.378 align:start position:0%
combined approach of behavioral therapy
 
06:25:47.930 --> 06:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
and physical therapies was all three
 
06:25:50.750 --> 06:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
things together not just one so that's
 
06:25:52.490 --> 06:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking for you guys and you
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
know that we've talked about that before
 
06:25:56.690 --> 06:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
and I think that when you use that term
 
06:25:58.250 --> 06:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's really important you know what
 
06:25:59.930 --> 06:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I don't even see it
 
06:26:01.730 --> 06:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
in the bill anyway so it's not but
 
06:26:02.990 --> 06:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's you you're right you're
 
06:26:06.770 --> 06:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
right so I wasn't going to go but no I
 
06:26:08.990 --> 06:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
think the um
 
06:26:11.448 --> 06:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
the big issue in all these years that
 
06:26:13.310 --> 06:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
I've been sitting here on this committee
 
06:26:13.320 --> 06:26:14.810 align:start position:0%
I've been sitting here on this committee
is

06:26:14.810 --> 06:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:26:17.690 --> 06:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
um is when they what I would interpret
 
06:26:19.490 --> 06:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
the evidence base when they're saying is
 
06:26:21.890 --> 06:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
eminent base is that there were some uh
 
06:26:25.070 --> 06:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
studies in which you had a control group
 
06:26:27.410 --> 06:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
right and you know how few of those
 
06:26:30.590 --> 06:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
those are those randomized all I know is
 
06:26:32.270 --> 06:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
that that's what they you know they want
 
06:26:34.690 --> 06:26:34.700 align:start position:0%
they want is to you know
 
06:26:37.670 --> 06:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
most of the you want placebos involved
 
06:26:39.770 --> 06:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
most of the studies that I've ever used
 
06:26:41.930 --> 06:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
to support what I do George Eng you
 
06:26:43.128 --> 06:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
don't know George angler doesn't matter
 
06:26:43.138 --> 06:26:44.270 align:start position:0%
don't know George angler doesn't matter
so

06:26:44.270 --> 06:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:26:45.890 --> 06:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
um he's an important person trust me but
 
06:26:48.048 --> 06:26:48.058 align:start position:0%
anyways he said was my personal
 
06:26:50.330 --> 06:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
experience and my and that but the other
 
06:26:51.948 --> 06:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
thing is a lot of times it's just some
 
06:26:53.750 --> 06:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
letter to the editor that changes the
 
06:26:55.730 --> 06:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
way everybody does everything you know
 
06:26:57.650 --> 06:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's scheduled D evidence it's not
 
06:27:01.128 --> 06:27:01.138 align:start position:0%
schedule a evidence so anyways I'm done
 
06:27:03.250 --> 06:27:03.260 align:start position:0%
it's great thank you very much
 
06:27:05.628 --> 06:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh I hope you feel like we you've got a
 
06:27:08.090 --> 06:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
good hearing
 
06:27:08.100 --> 06:27:09.230 align:start position:0%
good hearing
good

06:27:09.230 --> 06:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:27:12.350 --> 06:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
all right for the members uh I Paula did
 
06:27:14.150 --> 06:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
you have a handout
 
06:27:17.150 --> 06:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
and uh sorry about this I'll take you so
 
06:27:19.670 --> 06:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
so uh we are going to be you know
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
getting closer to doing our subcommittee
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
so please now that you've heard all
 
06:27:26.270 --> 06:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of different kinds of bills make
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
sure you let me know which subcommittee
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
you would like to be on because I I want
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
to get that put to bed fairly soon
 
06:27:32.878 --> 06:27:34.788 align:start position:0%
to get that put to bed fairly soon
otherwise

06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
06:27:36.590 --> 06:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
um have a have a great weekend because
 
06:27:39.190 --> 06:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
we're not coming in tomorrow
 
06:27:43.070 --> 06:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm just um wanted to mention I'm
 
06:27:44.930 --> 06:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
Paula minahan I think I met you last
 
06:27:47.390 --> 06:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
week and I didn't have this packet
 
06:27:49.850 --> 06:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
available but I just wanted you to take
 
06:27:51.948 --> 06:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
it home and review it it has some
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
interesting information about your
 
06:27:57.708 --> 06:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state and my card is
 
06:27:59.690 --> 06:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
here and I'm happy to answer any
 
06:28:01.610 --> 06:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have about any of
