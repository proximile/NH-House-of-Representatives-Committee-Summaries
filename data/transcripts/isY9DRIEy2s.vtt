me today
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
as you've heard i've been here before
 
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.909 align:start position:0%
as you've heard i've been here before
for

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
many mental health reasons
 
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.230 align:start position:0%
many mental health reasons
the

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
data that i'm showing to you shows that
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
we allow 12 year olds and up to seek
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment without
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
a parent's consent that's a federal law
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the charts you'll see
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
all these 50 states that allow this 10
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
treatments without a parent's consent
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
14 years and up and i'm simply asking
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
for talk therapy which is the least
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
invasive treatment there can be now
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
um in the bill you'll notice that there
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
may need to be an amendment
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
to just say talk therapy
 
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
to just say talk therapy
because

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want
 
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
we don't want
any

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
drugs being prescribed without a
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
parent's permission
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on that and we also
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't want any
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
nefarious things going on such as
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
forcing a child to
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
transition without a parent's consent as
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're simply asking for the least
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
invasive which is just talk therapy
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
since we already allow
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
12 year olds to go seek therapy
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
basically but they have we're basically
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
sending a message that they have to be
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
addicted to substances first and i think
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
we should get ahead of that
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
um on december 7th you'll notice
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
the united states surgeon general
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
published their findings on youth mental
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
health for the country
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
the published statement is a wake-up
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
call to our state and the rest of the
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
nation while mental health challenges
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
have continued to escalate among youth
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
for the past decade the pandemic has
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
only exacerbated this issue
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to start
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
writing some stuff down but here we go
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic one in five children
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
ages 3 to 17
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the last decade high school students
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
who reported feelings of hopelessness
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
increased by 40 percent that is more
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
than one in three students
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
there was a 36 36 percent increase in
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%

among youth ages 10 to 24 in the u.s
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
increased by 57 percent
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire suicide is the second

three weeks for inpatient treatment
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
averaging six children waiting before
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%

i come before you today pleading with
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
that this legislative body to pass this
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill as the evidence shows this is
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
merely a housekeeping bill to combat
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
this health emergency some of the policy
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
members of the body that are willing to
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
work on this issue but if you can see
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
per the rsas that i showed you that
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
allow 12 years old and sti treatment to
 
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.629 align:start position:0%
allow 12 years old and sti treatment to
happen

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
we could this bill could be as simple as
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
just housekeeping those two statutes and
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
putting in talk therapy
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
as a reasonable
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
as a reasonable
request

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
so i open
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%

suicide a year ago
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
and uh my my big problem with this is uh
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe

from the
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
graduate at the bottom half of that
 
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.670 align:start position:0%
graduate at the bottom half of that
class

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the parents need to have need to
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know need to need to be able to
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you i'm a little bit um
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
confused i apologize representative are
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
you saying that
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
you it's okay for 14 year olds to have
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
um sti treatments without a parent's
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
consent and have substance use treatment
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
disorder at age 12 but it's not okay to
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
get talk therapy
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
i i think that i think parents should
 
00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
i i think that i think parents should
have

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh you can't ask him a question
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
a point of clarification then i'm sorry
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
what i i believe the parents should have
 
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
what i i believe the parents should have
have

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
some have all say
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
i guess that's not a question but thank
 
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.269 align:start position:0%
i guess that's not a question but thank
you

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i just have a
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
question about the payment issue
 
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.189 align:start position:0%
question about the payment issue
um

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
in lines 12 to 14.
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh we lay out the
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bill lays out the idea that the
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
trading facility may build the insurance
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
as applicable
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
and then call payments paid from the
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated care fund
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the concern i have is it was
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
are you aware that this will
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
the information will still get back to
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
the parent because they'll receive an
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
explanation of benefits okay so it's not
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
so much confidentiality just having the
 
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.030 align:start position:0%
so much confidentiality just having the
financial

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.269 align:start position:0%
financial
coverage

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
i was a bit intrigued you said that
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
we're looking to reimagine our health
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
care system and i was just curious
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
where you're trying to take the
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare system here in new hampshire
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do some housekeeping i
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
mean if we're allowing 12 year olds to
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
go seek substance use disorder treatment
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
which is counseling and other methods of
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
help and we're allowing 14 year olds to
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
go seek sdi treatments without their
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
parents permission and help which those
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
two things in my opinion are more
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
invasive than talk therapy
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up um my follow-up is that that
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
seems like housekeeping not reimagining
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
the healthcare system and you had made
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
that statement in your in the beginning
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
of your your statements i can strike
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
reimagining and just say housekeeping
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking this question
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
line 24 emergency services
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
am i correct to believe that you're
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
emergency services providing
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
therapy or talk therapy or whatever it
 
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.710 align:start position:0%
therapy or talk therapy or whatever it
is

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
but you're not
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
you're not suggesting that hospitals
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
would actually be able to admit somebody
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
for mental health care
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
no i would not want to deny any
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner if there is a health
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
emergency to
 
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.509 align:start position:0%
emergency to
um

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
assist in going to the emergency room
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
just like any other practitioner would
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
say on their voicemail if this is an
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
emergency please contact your nearest
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
emergency room i hope that it would it
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
would function as that
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.629 align:start position:0%
would function as that
follow-up

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
okay so i think i understand so if this
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
would happen in an emergency room
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
allow somebody to
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
consent to those services at 16 years
 
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.949 align:start position:0%
consent to those services at 16 years
old

00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
but if i'm reading this correctly you're
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that this bill would
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
allow them to be admitted for
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services in that hospital if
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
they had a
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
if they had a psychiatric floor
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
i believe they would still need to get
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
parent permission to be admitted yeah
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
this is strictly for talk therapy
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
four second question follow-up question
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm looking on page two about the
 
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.230 align:start position:0%
i'm looking on page two about the
uncompensated

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
care fund
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
medicaid and uncompensated care fund
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
which i have no understanding of
 
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.190 align:start position:0%
which i have no understanding of
so

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
is there somebody following you who can
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
kind of talk specifically about what
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
that is and how it works and whether
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
this would actually
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
be a realistic way to pay for
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
some of these services
 
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.710 align:start position:0%
some of these services
yes

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
as i stated
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
i i hope that this body can focus on the
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
policy and that there are finance
 
00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
policy and that there are finance
members

catherine rogers representative rogers
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
has committed to working on the budget
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:16.310 align:start position:0%
for this
specifically

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
and can maybe it cannot be here today
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
for health reasons as as you all
 
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
for health reasons as as you all
understand

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
often the policy and the finance are
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
intertwined and overlapping and this is
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
why i as chair of this speak with
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
the chair of finance division three on a
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
regular basis because of that overlap
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that the numbers here
 
00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:39.750 align:start position:0%
so i don't see that the numbers here
um

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
with all due respect i was told by a
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
member in finance that
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
this could be looked at and managed and
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
if we're already paying for it
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
with the laws that i passed around
 
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.110 align:start position:0%
with the laws that i passed around
for

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
sdis and
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
substance use i'm sure that
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
again housekeeping we could add talk
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
therapy into those segments as well i
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
accept that thank you sorry
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i actually
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
have a question of the chair because as
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
as drafted it's very clear
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the sponsors
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
is to expend funds on this which makes
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
sense because it's a new service and i
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
wonder why there is no fiscal note
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever attached to it
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if perhaps
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
lba could be
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
asked why there isn't because
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
for this to be
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
looked at by finance it has to be an
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
early bill and i don't think it's been
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
designated as an early bill unless i'm
 
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.549 align:start position:0%
designated as an early bill unless i'm
mistaken

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:48.470 align:start position:0%
it is not
okay

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
i i think that's
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
it is of concern to me that that wasn't
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:12.950 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing
 
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing
the

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm just saying this for
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
clarifications in case i'm not catching
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
it all
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why you think a child
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
should be able to seek treatment
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
talk therapy
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
without parental consent is incest are
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
there other
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes my personal reasons
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'll list them again
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
my best friend in high school was gay
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
and is gay and wasn't accepted by his
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
own parents so they could never he could
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
never talk about it you could never talk
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
about it in high school but was teased
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
anyways so never formally came out for
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
many years suffered many shames
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
my other friend started sex work around
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
12 years old in middle school
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
and another one of my friends was on
 
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.549 align:start position:0%
and another one of my friends was on
assistance

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
and her father was
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
substance use for alcohol and used all
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
their assistance money for that
 
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:14.950 align:start position:0%
their assistance money for that
so

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
with these cases you're going to find
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
that these parents
 
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
that these parents
they

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
they it's not that they can't give
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
consent they're not even being parents
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
so how can we
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
help the kids that are living on their
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
own taking care of themselves
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
manage and cope with everyday
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
decision makings that
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
normal adults should be making not
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
children how can we provide them another
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
resource for the life that they've been
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
given already the hand that they've been
 
00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:47.669 align:start position:0%
given already the hand that they've been
given

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
how can we just allow them somebody to
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
follow up now
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
um in the in the case of of
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
um incest
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
and in the case of the
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh father
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
who was drinking away all the monies
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
those two things i see is
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
are criminal events and i would imagine
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
that they would be having
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
a state caseworker
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
assigned to them
 
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.190 align:start position:0%
assigned to them
um

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
that that is part of i think the parents
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
would automatically be involved
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
um because you want to get that child
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
away from the the one parent that's or
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
sibling that's the problem
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
those that i would
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:03.669 align:start position:0%
 
prepare

00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i know that teachers go through
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
training already to hopefully recognize
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
would it not be better to
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
help augment
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
that so that the parents can come in
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
if if it's for instance if it's um
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
a sexual orientation
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
i would think that
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
the parent being part of the counseling
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
would help that child more
 
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.190 align:start position:0%
would help that child more
um

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
because then that child would know
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
better how to
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
speak to their parents about this and
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the parents then could learn more about
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
how to
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
see what their child's going through
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
so so many of these things i see the
 
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.590 align:start position:0%
so so many of these things i see the
parent

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
as being beneficial to the overall
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
counseling situation
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
of that child is
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking from a place of of that a
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
parent should do things when i'm talking
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
from a place of reality where i've seen
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
parents don't do things and i am coming
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
from a background where there's not
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
enough caseworkers in our state and the
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
caseworkers we do have are overloaded
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that if you go talk to a parent for
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
20 minutes they can hide their problem
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
very easily to stay on assistance and
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking to children as a best
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
friend to all these people that don't
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to tattle on their family members
 
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.630 align:start position:0%
want to tattle on their family members
because

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
that they carry that because they don't
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
want anybody to get in trouble and have
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
it be them their fault and in also some
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
cases that if they were to go to foster
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
care it would be even worse for them so
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
it um i again i don't see the harm and
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
talk therapy when we offer so many other
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
invasive treatments without a parent's
 
00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:04.710 align:start position:0%
invasive treatments without a parent's
consent

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.190 align:start position:0%
consent
representative

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
would i be wise
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
to listen to one of my staff members
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
who's a family systems therapist
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
that secrets
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
are dangerous
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
and that it's sooner or later those
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
secrets come out in sometimes not a
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
controlled setting
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
that family systems talk therapy
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
is generally speaking far superior
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
but in those cases where the parent is a
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
bad actor we've got a more serious
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
problem going on here and needs some
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
kind of further intervention am i to
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
believe my staff member who says that to
 
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.390 align:start position:0%
believe my staff member who says that to
me

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
you're to believe that
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
family counseling is very beneficial
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
that isn't a reason to take away
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
personal therapy
 
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.149 align:start position:0%
personal therapy
and

00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
again when family members can't make it
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
to family therapy there has to be
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
another option provided
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
my question is about these these
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
children who are worried about getting
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
their parents in trouble my first
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
thought was that except in the case of
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
the sexuality these are all issues of
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting so if they needed
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
access they could speak to one of their
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
teachers and fortunately it's a
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
different world than you and i grew up
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
in and now there's a lot of allies for
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
people in the school system for gender
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
issues so there is somebody that they
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
can go to when that is an issue within
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
the home my question to you is if the
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
concern is that that children are
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
avoiding care because they're worried
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
their parents will get in trouble that
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
doing this gives them false comfort and
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
might create a larger problem if they go
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
and do this talk therapy and then their
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
patient their parents have the have the
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
authorities called on them because of
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
their neglect or criminal conduct and if
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
those secrets leading to that could lead
 
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:55.830 align:start position:0%
those secrets leading to that could lead
to

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
a potentially very bad outcome in the
 
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.950 align:start position:0%
a potentially very bad outcome in the
home

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative um so
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
in in in the
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
event that a child does say stuff i
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
as representative folsom made quite
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
aware that we should actually have an
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
intervention if it is that bad and if
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
i did some research the only people they
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
can tell our school teacher or school
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
nurse it's not investigated and it's not
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
a steady flow of treatment and it's not
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
a support system that you can count on
 
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.190 align:start position:0%
a support system that you can count on
and

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.310 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
when we're all we're very worried about
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
secrets and all these things we should
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
be worried about the numbers that are
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
increasing with committing suicide for
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
children because those are the real
 
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.190 align:start position:0%
children because those are the real
secrets

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
secrets
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
that can't come back
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to try something new
 
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to try something new
here

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh so
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh going back to the
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know evidence-based practice of
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
involving the whole family in
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
talk therapy
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's the direction that dcyf has sort
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
of taken over the years they
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
the their first resort when even in
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
cases of abuse and neglect
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
they will try to bring in a therapist
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
in home
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um to work with the parents and the
 
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.029 align:start position:0%
um to work with the parents and the
children

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i think for those cases where it's
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
the secrets are so severe that it would
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
warrant um further intervention that you
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
know those children would be removed
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
from that dangerous situation and could
 
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.310 align:start position:0%
from that dangerous situation and could
um

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
continue talk therapy you know
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
unencumbered by the worry of the parents
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
so my question
is

00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know how does when we have those
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
systems in place and the evidence is
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
that most most children benefit from the
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
parents being involved in that kind of
 
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.269 align:start position:0%
parents being involved in that kind of
therapy

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
how does that um
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know how does that uh justify
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
removing the rights of parents of most
 
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.269 align:start position:0%
removing the rights of parents of most
children

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be aware and to consent to such
 
00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
to be aware and to consent to such
treatment

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative cushman
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
i would think that if
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
a really healthy family
 
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.230 align:start position:0%
a really healthy family
or

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
aim to be healthy a very caring parent
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
parental figure
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
would always want to do what's best by
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
their kid
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
and would always
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the best care
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
and if they for whatever reason didn't
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable going to them
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
they would want them still to get the
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
care that they needed and that is
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what i've heard from most of the
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
parents in my district
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
and again when you have a family that's
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
so involved that's rarely the case where
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
a kid would go off and need to seek this
 
00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:56.549 align:start position:0%
a kid would go off and need to seek this
service

00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
but there is a reason why our numbers of
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
child suicide are increasing and i think
 
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.389 align:start position:0%
child suicide are increasing and i think
that

00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
it would shame us to not try something
 
00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:09.269 align:start position:0%
it would shame us to not try something
new

00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question i have a couple
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
one is are you aware that parents who
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
have often had their children removed
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
because of serious issues
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
still have the right to object
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
so a child who needs
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
needs counseling
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
is not permitted
 
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
is not permitted
i

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't have to deal with dcyf when
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
when i got divorced but my ex was so mad
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
about my son going to a counselor he
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
sued the counselor so counselor was
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
afraid to see him anymore so he said he
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't so i can see the need for this
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
kind of this kind of law especially
 
00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
kind of this kind of law especially
since

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm curious as to why you chose
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
16 maybe that's already part of the
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
current law because that's pretty old
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
if i've had it my child wasn't 16 at the
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
time when he needed he represented to
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
finish the question and let the
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative answer please um thank
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
you representative gay um yeah i i
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
brought this bill in 2020
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
and i had it for 12 and i pleaded with
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
before this body as i am here today and
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
requested that we have something and
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
something's better than nothing and that
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
if if whatever you felt was more
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable to passing if that meant
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
raising the age then i would do it but i
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
do believe it should be 12 because all
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
the things that i said
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
12 years old is when those things start
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
but again 16 is better than nothing
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
are we too um suspect i mean excuse me
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
wrong word are we to expect
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
that should this bill pass you will be
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
back with another bill
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
um lowering the age
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
to 12. i hope so okay thank you
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman thank you for calling on
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
me this is actually a question for you i
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if there was a pink
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
card from someone at the department of
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
health and human services that might
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
help us understand the uncompensated
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
care and medicaid fund there does not
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
sorry to be late and miss your early
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
part of your testimony
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
several different pieces of legislation
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
are doing the same thing and that is
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
adding additional professional
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals
 
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.269 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals
and

00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts as to where
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
these people are going to come from
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
because at this point
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
all of these mental health facilities
 
00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:09.590 align:start position:0%
all of these mental health facilities
are

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
organization are looking for staff
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
and this adds on to that list
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
and thank you for
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
your concern thank you representative
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right which is why i
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
was before this body fighting for people
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
to keep their out of state mental health
 
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.710 align:start position:0%
to keep their out of state mental health
professionals

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
now will counsel the extra people
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
needing counseling in our state
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
that reduces the number of counseling
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
spots available in their state does it
 
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
spots available in their state does it
not

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
it does not especially
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
since you're over telehealth if you have
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
an open slot and you can virtually help
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
somebody all over the world i don't see
 
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.669 align:start position:0%
somebody all over the world i don't see
how

00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
how they would be losing slots
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a better funded mental
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
health statewide program so they have
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
more mental health practitioners and
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
they have enough to share
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
so you would would you be suspecting
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
then that there are some states where
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's so many mental health counselors
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
they have time to spare and could um
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
telehealth are people is that your
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion and i think that the um
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
a member of health and human services
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
department said that around 42 of our
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens are relying on on
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
out-of-state mental health care
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
providers via telehealth
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman would you believe
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
that after practicing as a
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist for over 30 years in new
 
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist for over 30 years in new
hampshire

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:46.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire
and

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
attending countless ethics um
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
conferences where this kind of thing is
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
where the age of consent is discussed
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and after recently contacting the
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
director of um adolescent services and
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
the ceo of my
 
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.349 align:start position:0%
the ceo of my
local

00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
community mental health center that
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
after all that i am still not clear on
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the age of consent as it currently
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
stands without this bill
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
and would you agree that
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
this would provide some clarity about
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
whether people 16
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
and 17 would be able to access services
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
on their own thank you so much
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative and um thank you for
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
sending me that question
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
earlier as well
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes this is with all due respect we
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
should be protecting our own
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
health care professionals as well if
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
there isn't if there's a a
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
just an ambiguous dark hole where a law
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're putting the state at risk we're
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
putting the professionals at risk we're
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
putting the families at risk and the
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
children at risk we're doing nobody any
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
favors by continuing to ignore
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative cushman
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
um is there any risk to
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
having children
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
alone behind closed doors with an adult
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
who their family doesn't know when their
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
family doesn't know that they're there
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative cushman
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah any closed door between i would say
 
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.829 align:start position:0%
yeah any closed door between i would say
yes

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
if you just for clarification you're
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about licensed
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
therapists though
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
um via telehealth i i don't think if
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
they're a trusted
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
member in their own state
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
under the same licensing rules as we
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
heard earlier last week that there
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
should be concern
 
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.349 align:start position:0%
should be concern
and

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know that these children
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
are getting treated for what they're
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
trying to see somebody for
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
but as someone that was put in a private
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
room with a teacher and threatened i can
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't always trust
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
the adult and you need to go somewhere
 
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
the adult and you need to go somewhere
else

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and and first of all i just
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
like to say that i really appreciate
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
your continuing efforts to bring to
 
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.030 align:start position:0%
your continuing efforts to bring to
light

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
light
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
the huge need that there is out there
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
for care
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
for people who are not receiving it so
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's item number one
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to the specifics of the
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill and i think this is a conversation
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
we had last time as well and i'm still
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
the bill provides that the facility
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
it provides that let's see
 
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
it provides that let's see
uh

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
the parent or legal guardian shall not
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
be liable to pay for any treatment
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this section which is good
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
because they didn't contract for it so
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay for it
 
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay for it
but

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
my concern is the part about if the
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
miner is current under a parent or
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
guardian's insurance the treating
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
facility may build that insurance as
 
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.790 align:start position:0%
facility may build that insurance as
applicable

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that if things between
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
the parent and the child
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
are so broken that this child needs
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
assistance without the parents
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
involvement which indicates a pretty
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
high level of dysfunction on the
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
parental side
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it very risky
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
an insurer stepping in and then
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
the parents getting an explanation of
 
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.710 align:start position:0%
the parents getting an explanation of
benefits

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
which arrives at the home
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
at a time when there aren't other
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
safe people around
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm still wrestling with that and
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
how do you envision that playing out and
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
how do we safeguard
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
part of the minor's care
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much representative
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
weber since that was a main point of
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
contention and the last time i brought
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
this bill forward was payment which is
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
the only reason why i put that in there
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
to alleviate the burden off of the state
 
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
to alleviate the burden off of the state
but

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
i believe that you're right the privacy
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
would outweigh the burden and the state
 
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.230 align:start position:0%
would outweigh the burden and the state
should

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
be able to provide for a child that is
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
suffering that amount and i would be
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
amenable to amending that out
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
follow up yes i just had one other
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
question because we have
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
i have heard the use term talk therapy
 
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.069 align:start position:0%
i have heard the use term talk therapy
used

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i have heard the word counseling
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
used and i just wondered is there a term
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
of art that we should be using
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
when we want to specify that this child
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
is talking to an adult but the adult is
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
not prescribing
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the child
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that a definition would be
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
very valuable and that is again i
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
brought up at the beginning
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
since we we don't want providers giving
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
children medication you know without
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
parental consent that that should be
 
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.550 align:start position:0%
parental consent that that should be
defined

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
i agree to that
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
i i did the best i could i'm not a
 
00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
i i did the best i could i'm not a
lawyer

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
that is a bad excuse but
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
i did try to change it and address a lot
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that were brought
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
forward the first time i brought this
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
megan murray i represent the district of
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
um hillsborough 22 that is amherst
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i come before the body as not only a
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislator but a parent
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i would like
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
regarding this is the experience that i
 
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.190 align:start position:0%
regarding this is the experience that i
had

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
again sitting before the members of a
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
last year hearing folks similarly aged
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
that would be addressing this bill who
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
were around 16 years of age
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
many of the things that they shared with
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
us at that listening session did
 
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.150 align:start position:0%
us at that listening session did
stem

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
stem
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
from a desire to have the ability to
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.510 align:start position:0%
from a desire to have the ability to
independently

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
seek care whether it was peer support or
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
their own ability to seek
 
00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.430 align:start position:0%
their own ability to seek
um

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
talk therapy
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the event most 16 year olds at this
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
point have the ability to drive work
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
have a job
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
and are are becoming independent members
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
of their communities
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
and preparing for
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
graduation or grad school or trade
 
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
graduation or grad school or trade
schools

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
and i do believe
 
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.430 align:start position:0%
and i do believe
that

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
just like there would be an ability to
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
seek treatment for sti
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
treatments or sud which oftentimes does
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
have a mental health component to it
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
that this makes good sense
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
adolescents 16 years and older
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to seek
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
and as a parent
 
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
and as a parent
i

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
see that there are
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.710 align:start position:0%
situations where
[Music]

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
my child or another
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
had as had been testified to in in
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
milford at the round table discussion
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
where an individual seeks an outside
 
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.790 align:start position:0%
where an individual seeks an outside
independent

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
third party person to bounce something
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
off of that they are going through
 
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.630 align:start position:0%
off of that they are going through
um

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
and to that end i do seek that they're
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
like that this would be one
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
viable option to allowing
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
those who are 16 and older to be able to
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
do so and i'll happily take any
 
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.829 align:start position:0%
do so and i'll happily take any
questions

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative you mentioned various
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
things that a 16 year old can do such as
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
drive and hold a job
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
how many of those are truly
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
independent that is they live on their
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
own they pay all the bills or are they
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
not under the roof protection and
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
probably legal liability of their
 
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.870 align:start position:0%
probably legal liability of their
parents

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
so we're not quite as independent just
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
because one can drive and have a job are
 
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
because one can drive and have a job are
we

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
well to your point i i do
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
agree that there is a certain level of
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
independence well yet not being fully
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
independent i do agree to that however
 
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:03.190 align:start position:0%
independent i do agree to that however
um

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
there are many situations where
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
those who are of that age are in
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
situations that may require them
 
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
situations that may require them
to

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
that they have experiences outside of
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
the home and their family that might
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
require that they need to seek
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
treatment or therapies
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so for that it's simply asking for
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
talk therapy it's not asking for
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
medication in the event that there would
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
they would then
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
have to make that decision to notify
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
families i am assuming if it required a
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you mr chairman and thank
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in the state of
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who is under 18 requires
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
parental permission to get a driver's
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
do believe that that is the requirement
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
but yes i i also do believe that in the
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
somebody's health and mental health is
 
00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:17.270 align:start position:0%
somebody's health and mental health is
healthcare

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
is in need of being addressed i think
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
we should be making every effort to
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
allow that to be as barrier-free as
 
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.430 align:start position:0%
allow that to be as barrier-free as
possible

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
hello there we go
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
i know you can go online and download
 
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.630 align:start position:0%
i know you can go online and download
uh

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
apps for talk therapy
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
can you please
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
tell me how they
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
go about
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
keeping it in
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
with the laws of each state do they do
 
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.069 align:start position:0%
with the laws of each state do they do
they

00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
like if i tried to get on as a 12 year
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
old would they stop me from being able
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
to access the help that's
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
given on the app
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely sure of the question
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
when you said they
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
the people who run the apps
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not a website or content developer
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
so i do not know how that would exist in
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
that framework
 
00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
that framework
follow-up

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
so if they are available online and you
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
can download an app what would stop a
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
minor from being able just to get the
 
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.150 align:start position:0%
minor from being able just to get the
therapy

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.109 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
to your point i
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
i do not know how many apps are
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
available out there and we're not just
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about telehealth
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
talk therapy so
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah this is getting off the point about
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
a minor receiving health treatment
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
without parental consent
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
interesting question
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say this thread
 
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say this thread
no

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
that the teens who need this bill
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
do not have the protection of their
 
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.309 align:start position:0%
do not have the protection of their
parents

00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:47:24.319 --> 00:47:25.430 align:start position:0%
parents
and

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
school counselors are not necessarily
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
trained in more than counseling about
 
00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
trained in more than counseling about
school

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
question i do agree
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
that there are individuals seeking
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
further treatments in care who are 16
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
years of age or older
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i do agree that there are
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which school counseling
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
they're seeking
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
clarity and care outside of the school
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
counseling setting
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and else thank you
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um i noticed
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
inside of the list of places this can
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
occur one of the places that i think
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
may want to be considered
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
is the school itself there are school
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
psychologists and so forth that exist
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
but in the bill here is written that has
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
been left out if you look at line
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
and eight i think
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
the public schools any school system
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
if they also have the ability to treat
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
would that be something that
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
we should consider
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
to that end i did i want to go back
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
again to the very
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
eye-opening experience that i had
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
hearing individuals in milford new
 
00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:43.990 align:start position:0%
hearing individuals in milford new
hampshire

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
who did
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
some of them were school counselors some
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
of them were school social workers who
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
also stated that there was a large need
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
to expand resources and options
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
available for
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up or second question
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
again clarification on the question or
 
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.430 align:start position:0%

clarification
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
are you saying we should or should not
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
add schools to the list of facilities i
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense that that if that
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
first step
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
for an individual seeking care or
 
00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.109 align:start position:0%
for an individual seeking care or

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
but there are often times where it
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%

staters
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm here in support of this bill
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
as you've heard i believe there are some
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
amendments that may make it a stronger
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill but the spirit of it and the
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
underlying policy is important and
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
should be supported
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
new futures supports house bill 1409
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
because it is clear that youth need
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care treatment
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are healthy and safe
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire 15.08
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
of youth have reported having a major
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
depressive episode in the past year this
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
is higher than the national average
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's clear from these numbers that that
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
minors and teenagers in this instance
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
would benefit from having mental health
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
treatment access
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
without parental consent if their
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
parents are not supportive
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
um there is clearly
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
a as the surgeon general mentioned and
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
as representative klein knight mentioned
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
in her testimony
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
and an epidemic of mental health crisis
 
00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:14.069 align:start position:0%
and an epidemic of mental health crisis
in

00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
across the nation and in new hampshire
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is clear that we should be removing
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
boundaries and barriers to receiving
 
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.750 align:start position:0%
boundaries and barriers to receiving
treatment

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so this is one way that children
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
should be or could be able to receive
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
treatment without their parents consent
 
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:32.540 align:start position:0%
if their parents are not supportive
 
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
if their parents are not supportive
[Music]

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care treatment
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
supports the overall overall health and
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
well-being of a child or
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
in this instance a teenager
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
and would provide long-term better
 
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.230 align:start position:0%
and would provide long-term better
outcomes

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
when treatment is available early on
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's more effective and typically
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
better long-term outcomes than if
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
treatment is
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
given at a later stage in a mental
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
health crisis or
 
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
health crisis or
diagnosis

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
as proposed this bill would help improve
 
00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:06.549 align:start position:0%
as proposed this bill would help improve
the

00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
um health and wellness wellness of new
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire's youth um and any amendments
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm happy to review and and provide
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
comment on later but i believe as the
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill is written the spirit of it
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
should be considered and supported by
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
this body thank you and i'm happy to
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh we've certainly heard compelling
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's a need for uh
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
greater access to um mental health care
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
for youths
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
i guess the there's a disconnect though
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
because the issue at hand here is
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
and at what point does the problem
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
outweigh the problem of
 
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.990 align:start position:0%
outweigh the problem of
of

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
students being blocked from access
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
by parents
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
how big of a problem is it do we have
 
00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:00.470 align:start position:0%
how big of a problem is it do we have
any

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh information on how any statistics on
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
children who report that their parents
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
won't let them get that because it seems
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes we need to provide access so um but
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
is there really a problem other than the
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
worst case scenarios that we're pointing
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
out from from over our life experience
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
is there really a problem with parents
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
blocking access to mental health care
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
for their children
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative i don't have specific
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
specific statistics on that issue um but
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to review and see if i can get
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
some for you
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
um i think i'm also not a representative
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't have constituents that i
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
speak to on a daily basis but i think we
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
should hear from the representatives who
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
have spoken and said that this is an
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue in their communities
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
and understand that this is probably a
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
more widespread issue than we realize
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor uh sorry
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you mr chair and thanks for
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just uh uh some
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
idea uh or
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
can you provide us an idea about uh
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
any rule that might be already in place
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh say a child
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
comes um talks about a particular
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
problem uh about how long that can go on
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
or is there within the
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
statute or code of ethics for the
 
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.309 align:start position:0%
statute or code of ethics for the
profession

00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
saying that they can only see them once
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
or twice and then they must notify or is
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
there anything internal
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
that would terminate or
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
impact that ongoing care
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your question um i
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
am not aware of any rule that currently
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
exists in the mental health
 
00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:44.069 align:start position:0%
exists in the mental health
practitioners

00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
rules um or in the state
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
rsas that that
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
handle that problem but that's
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
potentially something we could support
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor for your testimony
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
in some of the round tables in milford
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
since i represent milford
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes i'm i'm aware that we have a crisis
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
for mental health
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
but i don't think this bill is going to
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
help us to solve the issues that we have
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
and my other concern is that a lot of
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
towns around milford
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance systems they don't have ent
 
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.630 align:start position:0%
ambulance systems they don't have ent
services

00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
over area
 
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.870 align:start position:0%
over area
and

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
my concern is how about any of these
 
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.150 align:start position:0%
my concern is how about any of these
kids

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
in these
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
areas where they don't have
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
these medical assistants
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
how about if any of these kids that they
 
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.870 align:start position:0%
how about if any of these kids that they
get

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
a crisis because of the medication
 
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.150 align:start position:0%
a crisis because of the medication
sometimes

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
even adults we can develop an um
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
worse sentence when medication
 
00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:27.109 align:start position:0%
worse sentence when medication
in

00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:28.390 align:start position:0%
in
these

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
towns in in the rural areas they don't
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
have those
 
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:34.549 align:start position:0%
have those
um

00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
those systems that they need so for me i
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
we need to consider those things too
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
and um i feel like this is like um
 
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.510 align:start position:0%
and um i feel like this is like um
putting

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
doctors and pharmacies in the risk to
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
lawsuits because
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
taking away a lot of the rights from
 
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.750 align:start position:0%
taking away a lot of the rights from
parents

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
i get it you know a lot of kids you know
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have the same relationship as
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i had with my kids growing up
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
but but i think this is not the solution
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
for that reason i i oppose this bill
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
would you take a question or two for
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
sure would you
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
in your opinion believe
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill while it might provide
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
some short-term
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
help to some
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
un-strengthen the family system
 
00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.309 align:start position:0%
un-strengthen the family system
yes

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative leon
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're saying that
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other problems that are
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
creating barriers to access to care and
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
do you think it's more important to look
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
at those before we look at breaking
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
those parent-child bonds for sure you
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
know it is incredible um you know to to
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
take the time to learn you know that
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to to help these families
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
to build the relationships that they
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
need and um
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
we know that we need more social workers
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
we know that we we have more um mental
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
health um
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
doctors and in in hospital they have a
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
crisis of beds and stuff like that so
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
those are the areas that i believe that
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
we can work on
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
instead of then try to get those parents
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
rise away from them or like you know
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
instead of then help and to build a
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
relationship taken away from from those
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
relationships that in the future you
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
know we want to have kids that they can
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
be able to come to the parents and be
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
able to be open and have those
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
relationship but
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
for me i feel like this has taken away
 
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.589 align:start position:0%
for me i feel like this has taken away
that

00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
that moment that we that we need as a
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
parents to build relationship with our
 
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.670 align:start position:0%
parents to build relationship with our
kids

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome sing no further
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.390 align:start position:0%
anybody from dhhs who might provide
information

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the record
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
my name is john williams i'm the
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
director of legislative affairs and uh
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
hp 1409 comes before you obviously the
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors are working to try to gain
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
greater access to certain mental health
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
treatment for for certain minors however
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
my commentary here today is specific to
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
starting on page three or rather page
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
two uh starting on line three which uh
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
starts section three of the bill on
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and medicaid fund
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware that the
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
department working along with the
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
important hospitals out there identified
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
either uninsured or medicaid where
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's uncompensated care to
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
try to do our best to providing needed
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
resources to critical access hospitals
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
and hospitals in nature so essentially
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
what you see starting on line three all
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
the way down to the bottom of page 34 is
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
existing law and the reason why they had
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do that is to show the proper
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
placement for the one amendment to this
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
section or rather to the um subparagraph
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it's a very long
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraph so going to page three
 
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:24.870 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraph so going to page three
the

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
text again all the way from sec from
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to 21 our existing law and you
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
can see all the specifics that they're
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
identifying for the use of uncompensated
 
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.390 align:start position:0%
identifying for the use of uncompensated
care

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
the bills sponsor or at least the office
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
of legislative services and and
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
providing uh for a
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
provision in a new roman subparagraph d
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
starting on line 22 through line 23
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
again so page 3 line 22 123 to pay for
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
deductibles copays and uncovered
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
services pursuant to the newly created
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 135 c 68 which is identified in
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
section 1 of the bill
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
of interest is that the department did
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
not receive from the legislative budget
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
assistance officer requested doing a
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
financial analysis nor did the
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
department of insurance for some of the
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who were here
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
in 2020 you may recall there was a very
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
similar bill
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1616
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
which was relative to
 
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.470 align:start position:0%
which was relative to
the

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
the
access

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
miners to to visit mental health
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
practitioners the bill was referred to
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
interim study before this committee
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
and but the department did was provided
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
an opportunity as well as the insurance
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
department to provide commentary on that
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
bill although that bill on a quick read
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe had anything provisions
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
for uncompensated care we did identify
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
that there would be an increased
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
utilization expected as a result of
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and i think it's fair to say
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
without a more thoughtful analysis that
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
we'd anticipate greater utilization uh
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
under this legislation uh for for the
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill if it were to go forward the
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
question here though is mechanically how
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
would this work and would have benefited
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
us to actually have reviewed this and i
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
certainly can take it back to our
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
division for medicaid services director
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
lipman and his staff to find out what
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences may be
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
but the devils are always in the detail
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the concern is around the mechanics
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
to pay for deductibles co-payment
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
co-payments and unins rather uncovered
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
services pursuant to the rsa
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
135 c 68 doesn't isn't clear to us
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
exactly how that would work since
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
currently it's designed specifically for
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
uninsured and medicaid
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
specific to making hospitals and related
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
facilities whole so
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
you can see mechanically where we would
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to really look into seeing whether
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
this does anything at all uh or how this
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
this would work um so with that that
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
concludes my commentary and like i said
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
at the beginning i could answer one of
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
the two questions i am here on behalf of
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber has a question for
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr williams and
 
01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr williams and
um

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
this has been a long process and a
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
really intractable one and i commend the
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative for sticking with it and
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
i understand her frustration having been
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
told the last time around
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
that there needed to be funding
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to now be told that the
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms are have haven't been
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
reviewed because somewhere
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
between ols and lba there was a slip and
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
nobody was notified that this bill had
 
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
nobody was notified that this bill had
significant

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts and significant insurance
 
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.589 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts and significant insurance
impact

01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
which is not her fault but
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think is
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
a reason for us to explore our systems
 
01:03:58.079 --> 01:03:58.950 align:start position:0%
a reason for us to explore our systems
but

01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's a long
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
prelude to the question which is
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
if we simply stripped out everything in
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
this bill except a sentence that said
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
minors may consent
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
at age 16
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
to receiving mental health services
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
providing such services
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
do not include medication which
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
was one of the big sticking points
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
what would the department's position be
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
and and reference weber thank you for
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
i would have to say that we would need
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
to see the specifics of the language to
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
provide you with a thoughtful response
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
to that commentary because i could just
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
make the
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
statement today that by removing section
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
three of the bill certainly you remove
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
the concern regarding the mechanics
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
behind the use of uncompensated care
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much further
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh beyond the other
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
folks who are
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
provider community for mental health
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
could probably better than i answer your
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
question on on trying to draw up a bill
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
that comports with
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
um law
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
and accomplishes a goal without
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
encroaching upon uncompensated care
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
if you wish i'm all set thank you very
 
01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:25.910 align:start position:0%
if you wish i'm all set thank you very
much

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
if we were to leave
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
section 3
 
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.589 align:start position:0%
section 3
in

01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering since i know nothing about
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
the uncompensated care and medicaid fund
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if that is
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
you said it was provided to hospitals
 
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.470 align:start position:0%
you said it was provided to hospitals
currently

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
is that provided to hospitals on an
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
aggregated basis
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
like not specific billing for specific
 
01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.069 align:start position:0%
like not specific billing for specific
clients

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
clients
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
and would this be
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
if that is the case would this be very
 
01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.789 align:start position:0%
if that is the case would this be very
different

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism for people
 
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism for people
for

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.010 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.270 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
mental health clinicians actually
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
and chairman pearson in response to
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro's questions
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
the world of uncompensated care and
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
compensated funds and i have lived part
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
of the journey on watching legislation
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
is an extremely complex world and i am
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
definitely not the person you should be
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
having a conversation with on the
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
interplay between not only our agency
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as well as revenue rather
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
also has a piece as you see embedded in
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
the rsa 84 i believe it's a d that's in
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
the section that's cited um i i know
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
director lipman
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
would probably be
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
in a good position to identify somebody
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
who you give you a high level tutorial
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
on uncompensated care but it is very
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
complex and very high level and beyond
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
the scope of what's in this bill today
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor thank you
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
we've got two final cards
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
and we're way over time the chair
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:25.190 align:start position:0%

testifying about a bill that i think has
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
some real potential for good
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
if we can get out of our own way
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
to address a couple concerns and forgive
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
me for jumping around a little bit
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
but a lot has been said that i think
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
i am not a mental health expert i have
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
had limited
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
experience myself but i think
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
there are two sides to this from what i
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
understand there's the clinical side
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
and the uncompensated care side and i
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
did not plan on touching on that but
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
we'll very briefly
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
as somebody who does work uh
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
peripherally in healthcare and uh
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
there's a practical and political side
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
and i think the best place to start is
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
by clearing up some myths
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
are presumed in a bill like this in
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
terms of impact on family structure
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
number one family structure is a
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
personal thing it
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
exists at your kitchen
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
dinner table it exists in your living
 
01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.229 align:start position:0%
dinner table it exists in your living
room

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
it is not the government's role
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
to dictate what that looks like and i
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
think to use that as an excuse to
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that access to care is gonna
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know have a negative impact on
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
relationships between parents and
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
children is ignoring the fact that if
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
we've gotten that far those
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
relationships are already broken
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
if anything talk therapy is going to
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
strengthen those relationships these are
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
certified clinical professionals
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
who are obligated by law not to report
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
um any
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
content from those conversations unless
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
imminent physical harm
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
is uh you know is a reality for that
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
child i have an eight-year-old daughter
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 16 this should be a
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
12 or 14 year old
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know wave of parental consent
 
01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:18.390 align:start position:0%
uh you know wave of parental consent
um

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
i would gladly let my eight-year-old do
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
talk therapy there is no damage in it
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know that's like me saying that
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
if i put a rain jacket on
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh right now and walk outside i can
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
assume it's gonna start raining
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
not only is it not gonna rain
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
but if unexpectedly it did i would be
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
better equipped to not get wet
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's what talk therapy is and that's
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
what proactive pre-emptive mental health
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
care is
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
so we need to be real about that right
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
now and dispel the myths
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is not an encroachment on family um
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
extending the same liberties and
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
freedoms to our children that we would
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
sit here in this room and claim to
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
protect for ourselves
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
sense to jump into a couple questions
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
that were asked um i think it was
 
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.950 align:start position:0%
that were asked um i think it was
representative

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
delemus

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
delemus
 
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
delemus
okay

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um i i can confirm uh in
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
response to your question to
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative murray that
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
when you do a telehealth application or
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
digital application for mental health
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
there is a parental
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
consent form that is required and you
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be denied access to that unless
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
you forged it in which case uh you know
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
any number of mechanisms would be
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
triggered that would probably uh defeat
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose you know that we're all
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
after here
 
01:10:35.679 --> 01:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
after here
um

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
no worries um with regard to
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
the concern over uncompensated care
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
i mean this may sound crass but we have
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
a system in place for this when a child
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
shows up at the er unaccompanied by an
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
adult however rarely that occurs thank
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
god the child is treated often even
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
adults who qualify for new hampshire
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
health or medicaid and new hampshire are
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
retroactively enrolled when they have a
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
serious medical issue
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
which skirts what should happen but
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's the best we got sometimes because
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let people die on the
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
front steps of the emergency room nor
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
should we allow unnecessary suicide to
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire
 
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.630 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire
so

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to someone who's not in
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
government and this may be easy for me
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get in the weeds on
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and medicaid
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment and eobs
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
um i would offer a suggestion that
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps a parallel um or follow-up
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
amendment should be uh you know explored
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh by the persons in this room and
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this bill to potentially um
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
create if it doesn't already exist and
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
might be a question for the gentleman
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
from health and human services um an
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
auto medicaid enrollment mechanism that
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
would occur uh for a minor
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh attempting to seek mental health care
 
01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
uh attempting to seek mental health care
services

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
um i also don't think
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
costs and the impact on the health care
 
01:11:59.679 --> 01:12:00.709 align:start position:0%
costs and the impact on the health care
structure

01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
suggested you know in this room i mean i
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
think you know what we're really after
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know you're looking at a couple
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
different scenarios here one is that or
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
maybe three scenarios
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario which is um
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
the child is in realistically the
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
majority of the children who are
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
impacted by this bill
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
are probably part of a population who
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
are likely never going to get parental
 
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
are likely never going to get parental
consent

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
so we should tell the truth
 
01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
so we should tell the truth
um

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
in which case many of those kids may
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
already be enrolled in medicaid and new
 
01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
already be enrolled in medicaid and new
hampshire

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
health um the other you know outcome
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
here is i think the concern that we hear
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit which is well there you
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
know we're going to have government in
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
our our living room and
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have uh the salem witch
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
trials all over again and you know kids
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
are going to be crying wolf to cause you
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
know drama or rebel against their
 
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
know drama or rebel against their
parents

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
number one back to a prior point
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you follow that train of thought to
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
fruition it's not going to work that way
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know that's not the way clinical
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
mental health is built and number two
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the case and that kid needs
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment anyway you know
 
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment anyway you know
so

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
where are we at you know um
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
the the other you know thing that i can
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
see happening
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
um you know would be
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
god forbid greater access and
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
participation in
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
proactive brand of mental health and
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's actually good for everybody
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
um this is a suicide prevention bill
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that would you know if we
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
had better access in the state you know
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
we obviously have a serious staffing
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh shortage in terms of mental health as
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
well so we certainly should be accessing
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
um surplus of mental health care
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
providers in other states that's just
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
common sense you know the wait list in
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about also existing in a
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
state that is very unwilling to regulate
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
not only gun
 
01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
not only gun
possession

01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
possession
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
but but sale um certainly it's
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
unconscious going off topic and you have
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
one minute left fair enough but this is
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
very relevant especially if we're
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussing letting college students
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
carry on campuses then we should
 
01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.709 align:start position:0%
carry on campuses then we should
probably

01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
match it with mental health access
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
i'll finish up
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
so i think we've covered most of our
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
i think conflating the right to drive
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
with the right to health care
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
is a reach at best
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i will end with one statement
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you believe in liberty if you believe
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
in free speech including the freedom of
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
confidential speech to a therapist if we
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe in the right to pursue happiness
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
as it best suits our needs our goals our
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
dreams including for our children then
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
we must believe in those things for our
 
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.189 align:start position:0%
we must believe in those things for our
children

01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
let's not be such foolish hypocrites
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
who would preach liberty but refuse to
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
practice it
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the same moment we fool ourselves
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
into believing it doesn't apply
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes as our last person
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
speaking to the bill russen chester from
 
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:18.390 align:start position:0%
speaking to the bill russen chester from
bedford

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
committee members i will keep it brief
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
i am a former child protective service
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
worker in the state of new hampshire and
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is not only a violation of
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
parental rights um and
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
further destroys transparency and
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
working together cooperatively with
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
families but it also puts our children
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
at significant risk
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i understand the
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
representatives intent behind the bill
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
but the reality is is that the parents
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
that are not going to consent
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
are the ones that we need to be worried
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
about those are the ones that when that
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
parent gets that letter in the mail
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
and says
 
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.070 align:start position:0%
and says
you

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
what did you do why did you do this
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
where's the where's the
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
where's the support
 
01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:17.270 align:start position:0%
where's the support
telehealth

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
um the other thing with regards to
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
telehealth with regards to telehealth
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
and talk therapy you do not need a
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
master's degree in most of our
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding states to practice
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
telehealth therapy you do not need a
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
degree even a bachelor's degree in
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
psychology or social social um
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of child development
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to speak a little bit as a
 
01:16:38.239 --> 01:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to speak a little bit as a
parent

01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
i had a stepdaughter who was
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
significantly traumatized in her very
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
young life
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
i took her out of that environment and i
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
i brought her into a really wonderful
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
environment my opinion she agrees still
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
to this day which is good
 
01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.630 align:start position:0%
to this day which is good
however

01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.950 align:start position:0%
however
um

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
my stepdaughter
 
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.550 align:start position:0%
my stepdaughter
was

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
had what they call transference
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
so when she started going through
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
um when she started being exposed to
 
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:13.990 align:start position:0%
um when she started being exposed to
uh

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
the child education or um sex education
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
classes and things like that i was made
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
aware as the parent she chose to go
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
through those classes i expected that
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
there would be some fallout from it
 
01:17:26.719 --> 01:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
there would be some fallout from it
um

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
i did not
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
identify her as a sexually reactive
 
01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.870 align:start position:0%
identify her as a sexually reactive
child

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
or a child that had significant mental
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
health issues she was going to therapy
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
three days a week
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
because it was that significant
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
however the school system
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
saw certain behaviors because they had
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
eight hours of training on how to
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
recognize problems
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
they took it upon themselves to not only
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
call child protective services but to
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
put my step-daughter into an out-of-home
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
placement for three days
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
and during that time she was further
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
abused the bottom line is that's the
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that this bill does for
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
the children of new hampshire
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
i know that wasn't the intent
 
01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
i know that wasn't the intent
um

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
and uh but i just wanted to make sure
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
that you folks understood there was
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
another side and a significant
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
consequence to a bill like this
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony and
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%

bill 1409
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
and let's take a minute or two breather
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%

yes

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%

01:21:41.679 --> 01:22:30.709 align:start position:0%
 
however

01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:44.709 align:start position:0%

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.629 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
my name is amanda bolden i represent
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough district 12 which is ward 5
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
um i passed around an info packet with
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
just a few
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
items of interest related to the bill
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll go over that in a little bit
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that there are
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that you can do without
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
parental consent in new hampshire once
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
you turn 16.
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
among them you can engage in sex acts
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
with a partner of any age you can become
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant you can impregnate another
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
you can raise your own child
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can obtain and use narcan to stop an
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
opiate overdose
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
you can seek and obtain a divorce you
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
can drop out of school
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of things
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
you that you that we entrust
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
16 year olds to make an independent
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
decision on
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
um and these are things of much greater
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
inconsequential importance than an fda
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
approved vaccination
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me that people age 16 and
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
older can make an informed decision
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
about vaccination
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't aimed at parents who
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
will object to vaccination based on some
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
scientific or health concern
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
or due to religious preference but at
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
parents who will never consent because
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
they are unavailable to the child
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
in manchester it's estimated that there
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
are between 300 and 750 homeless
 
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.270 align:start position:0%
are between 300 and 750 homeless
teenagers

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
teenagers
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
there have been many situations in
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
recent years due in large part to the
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic in which children are
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
effectively abandoned to manage their
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
own lives in the emotional and physical
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
absence of their parents
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
teachers in new hampshire schools have
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
seen many students who are unkempt with
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
overgrown hair clothes clearly in need
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
of laundering no access to a computer
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
for homework etc personally i serve on
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
the board of a non-profit that provides
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
winter coats to children all over new
 
01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
winter coats to children all over new
hampshire

01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a great demand every year
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
we have many programs in our state which
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
provide food to children every day so
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
that they can feed themselves over the
 
01:29:40.719 --> 01:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
that they can feed themselves over the
weekend

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
because their parents will not feed them
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
this type of program is referred to as
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
68 hours of hunger as this represents
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
the period of time that the child is out
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
of school over the weekend and thus
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
lacks access to food
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
during the early stages of the coveted
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
shutdowns when schools were completely
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
closed there was a massive effort in
 
01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.629 align:start position:0%
closed there was a massive effort in
manchester

01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i imagine other towns to use the
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
school buses to deliver breakfast and
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
lunch around the city as thousands of
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
manchester children rely on school for
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
their meals on a daily basis
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
and of course i've yet to meet a child
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
who made it through remote learning
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
without failing multiple classes as the
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
support structure they needed as
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
students was unavailable to them at home
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
in our state if a child can obtain a
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
dose of narcan and deploy it on their
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
unresponsive overdosing parent they
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
should also be able to obtain a desired
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
and age-appropriate vaccine
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
i agree that there are many things that
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
a person age 16 should not be able to do
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
without parental consent
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
because those activities would be
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
harmful to them but if a teenager is
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
focused on their health and would like
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated the law shouldn't stand
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
in their way
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
and some of the things
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
that i included in this packet
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
the bill for your reference
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
on the next page
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
a list of states that allow
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
minors to make health care decisions for
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
themselves related to vaccines
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
in varying degrees
 
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.390 align:start position:0%
in varying degrees
also

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
a piece from the new hampshire bulletin
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
that specifically states that children
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
must have parental consent to be
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in new hampshire
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
and it specifies that a permission form
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
must be signed by a parent or guardian
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
if they're having their vaccine
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
administered in the absence of their
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
parent for example
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
at the mobile vaccine clinic that's
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
specified in the
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the article
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
the next piece that i shared with you is
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
an article from manchester inklink salem
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
police charged couple with
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh living in filth and squalor with
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
child endangerment in this particular
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
situation i guess these folks
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
i mean they're
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty um but i
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
guess these folks had adopted multiple
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
children of varying ages
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
some of them 16 and 17
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
who were essentially completely
 
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.149 align:start position:0%
who were essentially completely
neglected

01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
neglected
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
and were not unable to
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
get regular health care among other
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
issues and it wasn't until a school
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
nurse noticed the bed bug bites and the
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
filthy filthiness of the children that
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
someone intervened
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then on the next page i wanted to
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
highlight that
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines are generally available for
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
free in new hampshire
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:32:10.719 --> 01:32:11.510 align:start position:0%
for children
and

01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
also if you're interested
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine schedule recommended by the
 
01:32:15.679 --> 01:32:17.030 align:start position:0%
the vaccine schedule recommended by the
cdc

01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
for people 18 and under and you can see
 
01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:21.430 align:start position:0%
for people 18 and under and you can see
that

01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
if someone reaches the age of 16
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.510 align:start position:0%
and i
is

01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.590 align:start position:0%
is
desiring

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
desiring
 
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.030 align:start position:0%
desiring
vaccines

01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
that they have not yet received in their
 
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.709 align:start position:0%
that they have not yet received in their
lives

01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
um due to some kind of neglect on the
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
part of a parent
 
01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.470 align:start position:0%
part of a parent
um

01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would be potentially all of the
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines that would have been
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
recommended by that time
 
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.790 align:start position:0%
recommended by that time
um

01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.669 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that are only recommended
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
at age 16 and up
 
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
at age 16 and up
are

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the influenza and covid19 vaccines
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
and i think covid they have it now for
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
all ages or down to five maybe
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
so my point is that if you reach the age
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
of 16
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
and require more than a flu vaccine it
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
is through neglect in my opinion and so
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to enable
 
01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
i'd like to enable
children

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
who don't live in a supportive
 
01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.510 align:start position:0%
who don't live in a supportive
environment

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.030 align:start position:0%
environment
to

01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
make some limited health care decisions
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
for themselves if they'd like to and i
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
think that's the entirety of my
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to take any questions
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:39.430 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
representative

01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to ask
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
this question which quite honestly in my
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
mind i've got like three questions
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
trying to form it into one
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
how does a 16 year old understand
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
understand adverse effects of a vaccine
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
and what kind of proof goes along with
 
01:34:05.199 --> 01:34:07.270 align:start position:0%
and what kind of proof goes along with
that

01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question how does a 16
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
year old understand the results and
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of engaging in sex
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
how do they understand the consequences
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
of engaging in sex with someone 20 or 30
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
hard to discuss the issue of consent
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's a complex and very philosophical
 
01:34:29.199 --> 01:34:31.030 align:start position:0%
it's a complex and very philosophical
discussion

01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
because in my opinion consent should
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
largely depend on the individual person
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't be age-based
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
because you know i have a 15 year old
 
01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.229 align:start position:0%
because you know i have a 15 year old
daughter

01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
she's learning to drive
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm terrified and i make the
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
my husband won't let me ride in the car
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
when she's practicing
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
because i'll scare her with my noises
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
um he handles it really well like she
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
tried to turn he we got to traffic
 
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.830 align:start position:0%
tried to turn he we got to traffic
circle

01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
circle
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
he told her go left she went left like
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
real left and he just casually grabbed
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
the steering wheel and was like i mean
 
01:35:04.239 --> 01:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
the steering wheel and was like i mean
around

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.709 align:start position:0%
around
so

01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
consent is a very complicated issue that
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
really ought to depend on the person but
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
in this situation we're talking about
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
people who have a desire
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
to they they've received enough
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
information they have a desire to make a
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
decision on their own behalf and they're
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
living in an environment where they're
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
not receiving the kind of support that
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
they need to inform that decision and at
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
some point there's nothing that you can
 
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
some point there's nothing that you can
do

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
to improve that situation like in the
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
if a child
 
01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.390 align:start position:0%
if a child
is

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
severely undersupported in their home
 
01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.070 align:start position:0%
severely undersupported in their home
life

01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
it is at some point a disservice to the
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
child to require that their
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
uninvolved parents
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
be the gateway to the decisions that
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
they need to make for their own health
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
i think so i don't know if i answered
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
i'm male so i i i takes a while for me
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
to process um
 
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.350 align:start position:0%
to process um
[Laughter]

01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm sorry if i insulted any of
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
the other males here um but you're
 
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.790 align:start position:0%
the other males here um but you're
forgiven

01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's the way i am um
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
i guess you did answer my question
 
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
i guess you did answer my question
because

01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
in in the answer you you basically said
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:36:35.679 --> 01:36:37.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know
um

01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i think about my own family
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
where we do uh and we brought our kids
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
up through uh understanding how the body
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
heals itself
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and through chiropractic care and
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
through massage and
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
mds are invol are definitely involved in
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
our lives too
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
but they you know they don't they don't
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
handle everything um just like the
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
chiropractor doesn't fix broken arms
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
i know if my 16 year old son wanted to
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
go get vaccinated after years of of
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
understanding how the body heals itself
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
i would want to have a conversation with
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
my son or my daughter
 
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
my son or my daughter
and

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would actually take that right
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that you have the kind of
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with your children where
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
you're able to impart
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
that information to them that they
 
01:37:35.679 --> 01:37:36.629 align:start position:0%
that information to them that they
listen

01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that they
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
implement that information in their
 
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.430 align:start position:0%
implement that information in their
lives

01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that opportunity that you have to
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
speak to your children is not taken from
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
you with this legislation it's your
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a parent to
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
establish that kind of communication
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
with them at a young age to maintain it
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
to always have their trust and to ensure
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
that they'll listen to you and do what
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
you believe is best for their health and
 
01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.189 align:start position:0%
you believe is best for their health and
safety

01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
no one can take that right from you as a
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
parent to be able to communicate with
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
your children make a good impression and
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
inform their decisions going forward
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's something that's always been
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
really important to me with my daughter
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
from a very young age
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
i've annoyed her
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
deeply because she asked me questions
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
like can i do this can i do that and i
 
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
like can i do this can i do that and i
say

01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to decide and i'm just
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
going to give you information to inform
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
your decision and a lot of times i'll
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
give her both sides of it and i'll make
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
her decide and it drives her insane and
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
she says mom just tell me what to do
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
and she can't deal with it sometimes
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
because she wants the easy way out and
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
she doesn't want to critically
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
think and assess something on her own
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
but i think it's really important to
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
instill in her the ability to analyze
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
and make informed decisions
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
especially because
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
she's 15 and a half but she looks like
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
she's in her 20s and that means that as
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
she moves through life she's employed
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know she's learning to drive we were
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
at an event at st anselm's and a girl
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
walked up here and said did i go to
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
middle school with you and she said i'm
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
in middle school at the time and the
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
girl was a college student at the school
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
and so i know that with my daughter
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
looking so much older and doing mature
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
things like working she's out in the
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
world she looks like she's another adult
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
and she needs to be able to
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
handle herself in a way that protects
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
her when i can't be there right
 
01:39:28.639 --> 01:39:29.350 align:start position:0%
her when i can't be there right
and

01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important to
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
maintain and protect the parents right
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
and responsibility to communicate well
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
with their children and impart necessary
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge um
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
but there are definitely children in new
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire who have no parents
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
who who have no parents
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
available to them to advise them and to
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
guide them and that's a shame and i
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
would hate to see that there are
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
children out there who desperately need
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
something or another and can't acquire
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
it because their parents are so
 
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.310 align:start position:0%
it because their parents are so
uninvolved

01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
uninvolved
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
and that's really the intent behind the
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislation it's not to interfere with
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
the relationship between a parent and a
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
child but to compensate for the lack of
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
a relationship
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if i addressed your
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
concern but again i'm really glad that
 
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.109 align:start position:0%
concern but again i'm really glad that
that's

01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
where things are with you and your
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
children so many parents don't impart
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge they just
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know control and dictate and that's
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
a shame because it puts a child in a
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
position when they're an adult of not
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.629 align:start position:0%
being able to
um

01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
make informed decisions like we'd hope
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
and they're just waiting for somebody to
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
give them instructions you know
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative in such a case where
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
parents are just plain not involved in
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
the lives of their children isn't the
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
proper remedy then for those children to
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
petition to be emancipated
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question that's a lot of
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
work just to get a vaccination if that's
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
what you want
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
no it's this bill last bill and a parade
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
of bills that are all doing the same
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
thing saying 16 year olds can do what
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
they darn well want
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is an exact session
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if i should be debating
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
or just answering questions um
 
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
or just answering questions um
but

01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
i can only speak for the bill that i
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
filed and i certainly had no knowledge
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
of any other bills at the time that they
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
were filed
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not making an argument that 16
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
year olds should be allowed to do a
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
plethora of things um in fact the only
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
argument i'm making is what's in this
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill and i think i closed my testimony
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the statement that there are all
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that i don't think 16
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
year olds should be allowed to do
 
01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:34.790 align:start position:0%
year olds should be allowed to do
and

01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
with some 16 year olds it may very well
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
be driving which they're entitled
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
to begin doing
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
um and nothing against my daughter who's
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
possibly watching um
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated conversation
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately this room and the
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
legislative process isn't set up for
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
a philosophical conversation we have to
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
take it one bill at a time before i call
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
on somebody for the viewing audience the
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative is speaking wonderfully
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
about her 15 year old daughter
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
i'm now chuckling over the 15 year old
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
daughter compliment and so i'm losing my
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
train of thought
 
01:42:23.199 --> 01:42:24.950 align:start position:0%
train of thought
um

01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
i uh recently
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
sat in on a discussion about
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
teenagers being held responsible for
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
things that they
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
made crimes they may commit and the fact
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
that they are not really
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
totally developed yet
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
in their thinking that they should not
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
be held
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
responsible after a certain point until
 
01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
after a certain point
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
um and so then i think back to um
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
my younger days
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
and my brother's younger days
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to talk about
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
ask you about peer pressure
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
think that most kids who
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
try their first cigarettes do it because
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
their parents said yes or no or because
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
their friends are doing it
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
i think my mom's also watching so i'm
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think going back to
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
um what representative king brought up
 
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:31.189 align:start position:0%
um what representative king brought up
earlier

01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's a complex topic
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
peer pressure is complicated um there's
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
peer pressure for all sorts of things
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of things that i don't
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
want my daughter doing that are not
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
illegal for her to do
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we can't leave it to government to
 
01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:45.750 align:start position:0%
and we can't leave it to government to
set

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
the standard for how a teenager should
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
behave at any given age on all fronts
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
when she was five we had a very strict
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
no sharpies and no gums rule or no gum
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
roll and then she actually stole gum
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
from her friend's house because i
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let her have any because i
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want her to get it on the walls
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
or in her bed or in her hair same with
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
the sharpies i didn't want to after i
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
cleaned sharpie off of one thing that
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have had sharpie on it i don't
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
remember what chemical you need to do
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
that where i was like we're done with
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
sharpies and you know how many sharpies
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
she has in a room now there's a lot
 
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.229 align:start position:0%
she has in a room now there's a lot
um

01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
there's no law requiring that my
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
daughter make good friends that are a
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
good influence on her and i have to
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
guide her through that um there's
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
so many things that a parent has to be
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about and think through and
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
manage on behalf of their child if they
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
want to be as involved for example as
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative king seems to be in the
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
lives of their children
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
and those things are things that if the
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
parent is not involved
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
the chips will fall where they may
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's no law
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
dictating what the child should be doing
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to ensure that the child will
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
make healthy and good decisions
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the absence of influence from their
 
01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.470 align:start position:0%
in the absence of influence from their
parents

01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
it sucks
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.070 align:start position:0%
that it is
so

01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
that it is so much the responsibility of
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
parents to guide children
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
um because all of them deserve a fair
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
shot but not all of them are born into
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
good situations
 
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
good situations
um

01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i understand that peer pressure can
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
be a factor
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
in so many decisions that a child makes
 
01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
in so many decisions that a child makes
and

01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just having trouble seeing
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
how it matters on this topic more than
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
any other especially with
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
your friends are driving why don't you
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
drive well maybe i suck at it well you
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
know or your friends are having sex why
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't you have sex guess what they
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
legally can at 16. is it reasonable
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
would i agree with it absolutely not
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think that teenagers should be
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
engaging in sex acts i don't think that
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
they understand what they're doing i
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that they understand the
 
01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.270 align:start position:0%
don't think that they understand the
consequences

01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
but they are legally allowed to and they
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
can be peer pressured into it these are
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
very big discussions um but i think that
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
01:46:03.119 --> 01:46:03.910 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
is

01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
not as consequential as some of the
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
things that we're letting 16 year olds
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
do by a long shot
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know answered
 
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.669 align:start position:0%
i don't know answered
um

01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned that there are a lot of
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
things that 16 year olds shouldn't be
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to do
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
do you feel maybe we should go back and
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct those things that say
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
maybe 16 is too young for this maybe
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
they should have parental
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
permission before they're allowed to do
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think when i saw the movie greece is
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
when i learned that there's no way
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk teenagers out of
 
01:46:40.239 --> 01:46:41.830 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk teenagers out of
that

01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:42.870 align:start position:0%
that
but

01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think that punishing teenagers
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
for engaging in sex acts for example and
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
i know this is way off the topic of the
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
bill because the bill's about getting
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
one or two shots here there
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that uh
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
punishing teenagers
 
01:46:57.679 --> 01:46:58.709 align:start position:0%
punishing teenagers
legally

01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
legally
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
because there's grounding and there's
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
you can't have your cell phone and
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
there's you're done with twitter um but
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think that legal punishment
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
against children is gonna dissuade them
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily from sex i don't think
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily healthy
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative and i think that again
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
going back to representative king's
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
example um it's better to have a healthy
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
open line of communication with your
 
01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.790 align:start position:0%
open line of communication with your
kids

01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
kids
um

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
but i think that we should stick to the
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill as the chairman notice
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative folsom follow up okay one
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much one last question um
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
it feels as if you are throwing um
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
the parents who are good parents who are
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
paying attention who are engaged in
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
their kids lives and all of that and
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
you're taking away their rights
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
because of a few the the parents that
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
are bad apples
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
is there any way to
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
not throw the good parents under the bus
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's a that represents a
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
severe misunderstanding of the bill
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
if someone has a good open line of
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
communication with their children the
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
way that representative king does the
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
way that i hope i do
 
01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:09.830 align:start position:0%
way that i hope i do
um

01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
they don't need to rely on the
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
government to step in
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
to prevent their children from doing
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
things that they would find ill advised
 
01:48:17.679 --> 01:48:22.229 align:start position:0%
things that they would find ill advised
and

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think that that's what is preserved as
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
i said earlier with this legislation
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
is a parent's right and duty and
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
obligation to be a good communicator
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
with their child be good influence
 
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.350 align:start position:0%
with their child be good influence
and

01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're heard when they're
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
trying to impart important information
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
which is essentially the only purpose of
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
parenting is you've made a duplicate of
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
yourself you need to make it survive in
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
the wild right you need to pass on the
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
right information
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to have children you
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
need to be able to communicate with them
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and it comes with an attendant this time
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
yeah isn't that good that's really good
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
no you have an attendant and he's
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
helping you there we go thank you thank
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
you amanda if everyone can hear him
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
i i understand what you're trying to do
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill uh uh
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
mentions the teenager and it mentions
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
the parents but it also involves a third
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
group of people which are the providers
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
that give that shot and you did make an
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
attempt in it to say that they can give
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
such a vaccination without the consent
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the miners parent or their legal
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
guardian and i just wonder if this goes
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
far enough to protect that prescriber
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
from any legal action that a parent or
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
someone else may take or
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
all i'm questioning is
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
would you have any objection to seeing
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
it go a little bit further to build that
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
legal protection if they can't be sued
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
if they do it thank you
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
um i know that in
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law there are a lot of
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
situations in which a prescriber has
 
01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:13.750 align:start position:0%
situations in which a prescriber has
immunity

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
um for giving out certain medications
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
um or other drugs
 
01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:21.430 align:start position:0%
um or other drugs
i

01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that it would be
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
advisable to
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
add such
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
immunity to this legislation
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
doctors to be able to take into
 
01:50:35.679 --> 01:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
doctors to be able to take into
consideration

01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
all of the factors
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
that are uh
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
part and parcel to the decision that
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
they're making
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
i hope that that makes sense and that's
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
up to the committee it's in your hands
 
01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
up to the committee it's in your hands
now

01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that that's necessary
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
and i i hope that that's part of the
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
provider's decision-making process
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
thanks representative leon
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative bolton for being here and
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
answering these questions um there a lot
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
of the the idea when you brought up the
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
philosophical and personal consent
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
issues are really intriguing and i think
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
to drive to work or to drop out of
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
school in new hampshire when you're 16
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
does require parental consent so they're
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
starting to move towards decision making
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
in adulthood but they're not quite there
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
yet so there's that guidance
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the coven 19
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine which is not yet fully approved
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's just in the ua so i know that puts
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
it down the road but we have a very
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
coercive environment right now
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
surrounding this covid vaccine there are
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
people who are losing their jobs there
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
are people who are being denied access
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
to locations there are middle school
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
trips to washington dc being cancelled
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
because they don't know the vaccination
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
status of all of the
 
01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.830 align:start position:0%
status of all of the
students

01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
when we have adults that are having a
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
hard time standing up to this peer
 
01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:53.030 align:start position:0%
hard time standing up to this peer
pressure

01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
how can we expect that six do you think
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
that 16 year olds have the moral
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
fortitude and strength to stand up to
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
their peers when they say amanda unless
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
you get vaccinated we can't go to the
 
01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:11.830 align:start position:0%
you get vaccinated we can't go to the
championship

01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's a lot to unpack
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
um can you walk me through i feel like
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
there were maybe three questions in
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
there and i unfortunately i didn't take
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
notes because i wasn't expecting a lot
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
do you know that there's consent
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
required from the parent to drive work
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
or drop out of school in new hampshire
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
um i looked up
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
these laws in preparation for this
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and it's my understanding that
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
only the superintendent's
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
and consent to dropout is required to
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
drop out of school in new hampshire and
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
not parental consent
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
so then i guess that's the
 
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.950 align:start position:0%
so then i guess that's the
superintendent

01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
there you require the superintendent
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
could contact the parents but i haven't
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
seen anything in new hampshire law
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
requiring them to so driving and working
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
and do you agree that it's a very
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
coercive environment around the vat
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
covered vaccine right now and people are
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
having to decide whether to keep their
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
job or if they don't believe that it's
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
the right choice sometimes they're
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
getting fired over this
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
my daughter works at market basket and
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
hooks it in the dairy department so if
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
you want to go bother her
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
tell her i sent you
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
she stalks the yogurt and she's never
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
been asked to be vaccinated she is but
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
and it was something she wanted she was
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
really excited to get vaccinated when
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
she got the little sticker that says
 
01:53:25.599 --> 01:53:26.790 align:start position:0%
she got the little sticker that says
pfizer

01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
pfizer
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
is part of the process she put on her
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
door to her room
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
but she's never been asked to be
 
01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.950 align:start position:0%
but she's never been asked to be
vaccinated

01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:34.149 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
for

01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
school or for work so i guess i'm not
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
aware of a coercive environment around
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
with that i'm glad that your daughter's
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing what um
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
many many people have testified to this
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
committee and the last one is would you
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
agree that that teenagers are better
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
able to stand up to peer pressure than
 
01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
able to stand up to peer pressure than
adults

01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that i'd give that much
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
credit to adults
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
oh by the way my daughter's also in
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
sports and she wasn't asked to be
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for sports
 
01:54:01.599 --> 01:54:02.790 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for sports
either

01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
earlier uh if i understood you correctly
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
you seem to
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
imply or actually state
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
that failure to get recommended or
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
failure for of a parent
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
to get their child vaccinated with
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
was tantamount to neglect
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so my question is whether
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
to not have a child vaccinated
 
01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.589 align:start position:0%
to not have a child vaccinated
even

01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
with a vaccine that is recommended
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
is that a carefully considered decision
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
by an informed parent or
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
is that prima facie evidence of
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
neglect um i think when i said the word
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
neglect i was talking more from my own
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
perspective i think that it would be
 
01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:57.109 align:start position:0%
perspective i think that it would be
neglectful

01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
neglectful
 
01:54:57.119 --> 01:54:57.910 align:start position:0%
neglectful
um

01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i think really when i say that i find
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
it neglectful i'm thinking of people
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
i've known
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
who were generally neglectful of their
 
01:55:05.679 --> 01:55:06.709 align:start position:0%
who were generally neglectful of their
children

01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
and as part of that environment also
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
their children never went to the doctor
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
at all they weren't they didn't go to
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
checkups they didn't go to the dentist
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
broke an arm
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
you go to the er you go home that's it
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
and so i i think i was more thinking of
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
environments that i found neglectful
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
that offended me as a parent because i
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
felt that those children deserve more
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
um and deserve care and concern about
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
their health and one of the features in
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
that environment was
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
not being vaccinated for any disease
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
no matter how important
 
01:55:43.119 --> 01:55:43.990 align:start position:0%
no matter how important
okay

01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up and the bill applies to
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
all vaccines that a doctor would find
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
advisable to give to a child of that age
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so i i think
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
that clarifies it but i i guess i'll
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'll just ask one further question which
 
01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
i'll just ask one further question which
is

01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.790 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you believe then that a
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
parent's decision not to have a child
 
01:56:10.719 --> 01:56:11.990 align:start position:0%
parent's decision not to have a child
vaccinated

01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate right that sits with the
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
oh boy
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
i thought this was the health and human
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
services committee not the tough
 
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
questions careful careful
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
oh i'm not insulting i'm just kidding
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
around um
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
we get that that's a big uh
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
you guys have a great room by the way
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'm totally jealous and you guys are
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
really great nature and i like that my
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
committee's really um stern um not us
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's probably the small room that we're
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
stuck in um
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's a big discussion um
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
really um
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
my personal i think philosophical
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
perspective on that um because obviously
 
01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:00.140 align:start position:0%
i might think someone's a jerk for
 
01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.510 align:start position:0%
i might think someone's a jerk for
[Music]

01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
telling their kid
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a santa claus because i
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
remember how much it hurt when i found
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
out there wasn't and how that affected
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
my faith
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so many other aspects of my life
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
right so there's a multitude of things i
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
could have an opinion about about a
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
household and about how a child is
 
01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.470 align:start position:0%
household and about how a child is
reared

01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
reared
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think philosophically
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
you should be able to make decisions
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
for your child
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
until it can be determined
 
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.629 align:start position:0%
until it can be determined
that

01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
your decisions are harmful to the child
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
and if they're harmful to the child i
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
think that there should be intervention
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i think that harm is determined on a
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis and i don't know if
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a it all depends kind
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
of bs answer and i don't mean it like
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
that i really think that so many things
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
depend on the situation the person the
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
people involved and the impacts of
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
different decisions in those situations
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my philosophical and personal
 
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:57.189 align:start position:0%
so that's my philosophical and personal
perspective

01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:57:57.199 --> 01:57:59.109 align:start position:0%
perspective
but

01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
i think that if
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:58:03.679 --> 01:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
i think that
if

01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's not
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh home with their child um and their
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
child's home alone and their child's you
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
know under 10 i think that if they're
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
not taking their kid to school i think
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
that if they're not taking them to the
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
doctor they don't go to the dentist when
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
something hurts they only go to the er
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
if they break something and that's it
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
and along with that their children are
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
never vaccinated that's a neglectful
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
environment overall i think that if it's
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
a positive environment and there's just
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
the only thing is that they're choosing
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
not to vaccinate their child we can have
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
a discussion
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
but that's not really what this bill is
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
aimed at because again if you have a
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
supportive environment your child's not
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to be running off making decisions
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
that you disagree with they're listening
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
to you they're
 
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:55.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:57.350 align:start position:0%
representative
love

01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there is such a
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
thing as as vaccine injury
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
and and would you believe that a lot of
 
01:59:07.119 --> 01:59:08.070 align:start position:0%
and and would you believe that a lot of
parents

01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
um you know when their child is vaccine
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine injured
 
01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.950 align:start position:0%
vaccine injured
um

01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%

beginning
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
would you believe the unintended
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this could be
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
real far-reaching a hypothetical
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%

change your life
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
um there's a whole host of decisions
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we already allow 16 year olds to
 
02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.550 align:start position:0%
that we already allow 16 year olds to
make

02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
that are life-altering including um
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
engaging in sex sex with people of any
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
age um engaging in sex acts without
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
protection dropping out of school and uh
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned equal obtaining and
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
deploying narcan on an overdosing person
 
02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:56.870 align:start position:0%
deploying narcan on an overdosing person
um

02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
life's complicated
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
one thing that is not part of this bill
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
that i would support is being able to
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
open up
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine manufacturers to suit
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
because i think that if you
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
genuinely believe
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
that those health effects are the result
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
of that vaccine you should have your day
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
in court i think people should have
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
their day in court for pretty much
 
02:01:17.679 --> 02:01:19.750 align:start position:0%
their day in court for pretty much
anything

02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.350 align:start position:0%
anything
but

02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
while you are
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
surely responsible for
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
the care of a three-year-old or a
 
02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
the care of a three-year-old or a
two-year-old

02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
two-year-old
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
there is a point where we start letting
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
our children make decisions for
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
themselves and they should have that
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.719 --> 02:01:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
02:01:39.679 --> 02:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
what this bill
protects

02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
protects
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
is your
 
02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.589 align:start position:0%
is your
ability

02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
and responsibility as a parent
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
to parent your child properly and to
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
guide them to make the decisions that
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
you'd like them to make and i know that
 
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.270 align:start position:0%
you'd like them to make and i know that
teenagers

02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
teenagers
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a rule have a reputation for
 
02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
as a rule have a reputation for
rambunctiousness

02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
rambunctiousness
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
but i know that there are exceptions i
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
think that representative king
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
described that and i feel like that is
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
the case in my household i i think that
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
my daughter is very responsible um
 
02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.750 align:start position:0%
my daughter is very responsible um
reasonable

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh probably watching and your body
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
but i mean and she knows it she actually
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
was recently appointed by the governor
 
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
to the legislative youth advisory
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
council we're going to have to
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%

i heard you say we several times but i
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
haven't heard
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
that there are two people
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
involved with some of these decisions i
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
i take it you have a husband
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
so you haven't mentioned much about his
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
let's see i don't think i never thought
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'd have to describe my
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
husband's role he's uh very involved um
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
he so my daughter does uh she goes to
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
charter school she goes to velax i don't
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
know if that's a school that this
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee normally hears about education
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
committee would
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
so she does all her school at home
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's why she has the opportunity to
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
sit and watch this hearing and a servant
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%

husband the representative other bolden
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
and he does all of her school with her
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
um he's very involved in her life and
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
she often goes to him for advice instead
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
of me but i don't know
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%

defending parents and defending children
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
i think i'd ask the legislation to
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
consider this bill as it relates to risk
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
and benefit
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
for a 16 year old
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
in this case we are talking covid
 
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:21.910 align:start position:0%
in this case we are talking covid
uh

02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
dying for a 16 year old is greater
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
if they take a vaccine over
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
the risk of dying for a 16 year old is
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
greater for someone who's taken the
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
so-called vaccine
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just talk a little bit about
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
phrases and testimony that we've heard
 
02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:08.390 align:start position:0%
phrases and testimony that we've heard
earlier

02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll use words that were spoken
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
desperately needed in the in the
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
relationship of the vaccine presently
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%

02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of peer pressure in high

school i remember we did some crazy
 
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:05.589 align:start position:0%
school i remember we did some crazy
things

02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%

02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
i look at the historically the funds
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
that came from washington the 22 million
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
dollars that the executive council
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
refused to approve
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
late at night they were approved
 
02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
late at night they were approved
to

02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:26.080 align:start position:0%

02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
can you imagine
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
a vaccine

02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
driving up to the high school as as they
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
do in my town their schedule there
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
and unbeknownst to the parents
 
02:07:45.599 --> 02:07:46.470 align:start position:0%
and unbeknownst to the parents
well

02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
there's a dare or whatever a decision
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
from the the team or the gang or the
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
clique to
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
let's all go get vaccinated
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
and they're 16 there they go
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
unaware of the risks of the vaccine
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and yes i think i think a child's brain
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
a 16 year old child's brain has a long
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
way to go to be developed fully to make
 
02:08:11.199 --> 02:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
way to go to be developed fully to make
decisions

02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%

02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:26.709 align:start position:0%
adults have readily signed up for the

vares report
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the dangers of

other uh comments that have been made
 
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.830 align:start position:0%
other uh comments that have been made
about

02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
parental decision i defend parental
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
decisions for children not to get
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and i think those decisions
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
need to be honored they're not
 
02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.229 align:start position:0%
need to be honored they're not
neglectful

02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
neglectful
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
gathering months ago when we were all
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
gathered to
 
02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:06.629 align:start position:0%
gathered to
[Music]

02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
go against this
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
money from
 
02:09:10.079 --> 02:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
money from
washington

02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
washington
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
and we met a young woman with three
 
02:09:14.719 --> 02:09:16.229 align:start position:0%
and we met a young woman with three
children

02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
who homeschooled her children
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
they had never had vaccines
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
they were healthy as horses so to speak
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
was she neglectful of her children
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
no does she have the right to have them
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
so i look at
 
02:09:37.119 --> 02:09:38.069 align:start position:0%
so i look at
the

02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
risk-to-benefit ratio if we look if we
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
could compare this to the previous bill
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
that was heard i think it was 1409
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
someone made a clear
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
argument that there was
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
very little risk for
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
mental health services for children who
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
but the um
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
there are risks out there for vaccine
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
children and uh
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
and young adults
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
are better off getting
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
back uh getting
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
infected with the disease from a naive
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint in developing their own
 
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
standpoint in developing their own
antibodies

02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
so i will just repeat that again the
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
risk of getting a vaccine the risk of
 
02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
risk of getting a vaccine the risk of
dying

02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
dying
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh for getting a vaccine is greater than
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
from getting coveted in the
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
16 and under age group and be aware that
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the vares report in the state of new
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire there is one such case of a 16
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions from the
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
the chair now calls upon abigail rogers
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%

we're here to provide some information
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
related to the bill we're not taking a
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but we would like
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
to provide some information on
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman pearson members of
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is anne marie
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
mccary i'm the immunization section
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
chief for the department of health and
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
human services division of public health
 
02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
immunization is considered one of the
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
most important public health
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
achievements of the last century safe
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
and effective immunizations have
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
prevented millions of illnesses
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities and deaths in the united
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
states despite the success
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine preventable diseases such as
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
measles mumps woven cough and now covet
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
19 continue to circulate and result in
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
preventable hospitalizations and death
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination coverage is not 100 percent
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
nor are vaccines 100 percent effective
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
so outbreaks can occur when an
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated person becomes infected and
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
introduces a disease into a community
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
especially one with low vaccination
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
rates our best defense against all
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases is immunization it's
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
therefore critical to support measures
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
with which increase access to new
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire immunization
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
because of new hampshire's immunization
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
school requirements
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
our teens are well immunized for those
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines having school immunization
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
requirements such as hepatitis b
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
measles mumps rubella
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
tetanus diphtheria pertussis and
 
02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:45.589 align:start position:0%
tetanus diphtheria pertussis and
varicella

02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
varicella
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
our teens however are less protected
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
against diseases that do not have school
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
requirements such as hepatitis a
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
hpv and meningitis this means that at
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
least 30 percent of new hampshire's
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
adolescents are not optimally protected
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
against communicable diseases that can
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
lead to severe illness disability and
 
02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:06.069 align:start position:0%
lead to severe illness disability and
death

02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
death
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
although historically new hampshire has
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
experienced high vaccine rates the
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
department is concerned about the
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
disruption of the pandemic
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the receipt of preventative health

care services including routine
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
immunizations the delay in receiving
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
immunizations may exacerbate the
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
potential resurgence of
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine-preventable diseases
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
lowering the age at which an individual
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
can consent to vaccination services
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
would increase access to preventive
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
health services and protect individuals
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
and others from communicable diseases
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
the department's goals through
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
immunization policy are to provide
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
public health protection while also
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately balancing individual
 
02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:45.430 align:start position:0%
appropriately balancing individual
choice

02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate your
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
consideration and your opportunity for
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
me to be here today i'm happy to answer
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
any questions the chair recognizes dr
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
sorry representative shapiro
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman not all of us want
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be doctors
 
02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:03.589 align:start position:0%
to be doctors
um

02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question um
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
in reference to um the last speaker who
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
preceded you i'm wondering if you would
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
the risk to adolescents from taking the
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
covet vaccination
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
various copic vaccinations
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
the risk of death is greater than
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
from covid
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
the disease itself and more specifically
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
might you have any specific data or
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
information from new hampshire about
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think in relationship to hb 1126 we do
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that this is for those
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have been
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
approved by the fda and are and are
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
licensed for that approval
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
as such the cova vaccination would not
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
yet fall under this purview as uh that
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
is still under emergency use
 
02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
is still under emergency use
authorization

02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
i think that for kovid the data is
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
really still emerging
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
the information is not clear
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
it is true that
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
those that are
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
infected and are at highest risk do tend
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
to be in those older age groups however
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
there are individuals of younger age who
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
have had
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
impact from covid19 infection and
 
02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
impact from covid19 infection and
disease

02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.870 --> 02:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
is that on
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
yep um i just wanted to thank you for
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
allowing me a question thank you for
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question i just wanted a
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
clarification on some of the statistics
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
that you gave out did you say 27 percent
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire children have not
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
received the usual barrage of
 
02:15:46.239 --> 02:15:48.149 align:start position:0%
received the usual barrage of
vaccinations

02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
so for those immunizations at our school
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
required our rates are very high
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
for vaccination rates so we're when
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking at hepatitis b mmr tdap
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
and varicella those rates are
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 95 to 98 99
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
coverage and these statistics do come
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
from the national institute excuse me
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
it's a national immunization survey so
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
this is patient reported survey because
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
our our immunization registry is so new
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
we don't actually have actual data from
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
the state this is coming from parental
 
02:16:23.199 --> 02:16:24.470 align:start position:0%
the state this is coming from parental
survey

02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
survey
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
so those rates are very high but when we
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
do look at hepatitis a that rate is 77.8
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
percent coverage hpv for females is 71.8
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
percent and meningitis is 91.1 percent
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we do know that there are individuals
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
that are at risk of communicable
 
02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:44.389 align:start position:0%
that are at risk of communicable
diseases

02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
and when we're looking at the the female
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
population for hpv for instance um that
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
rate is approximately 30
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
um for covid19 although it not
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
applicable to this uh our vaccination
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
rate is less than 50 for this age
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
population okay thank you very much
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that hpv
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
in many countries has been taken off the
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
required list and that the
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
the children
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
who range in age from
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
nine to
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
early twenties
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
many people have suffered
 
02:17:23.359 --> 02:17:24.790 align:start position:0%
many people have suffered
severe

02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
severe
 
02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:26.309 align:start position:0%
severe
life

02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:17:26.319 --> 02:17:27.750 align:start position:0%
life
devastating

02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:29.509 align:start position:0%
devastating
reactions

02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
and right now is there any kind of test
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
that you could take before you take the
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
shot to see if your body would be in
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that category that it would
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know react severely
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any such tests i think
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
that what we do want to do is look at
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
the data to see
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers of cases of cancer that are
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
being prevented from hpv and compare
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
that risk benefit
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
ratio when making those types of
 
02:17:58.559 --> 02:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
ratio when making those types of
decisions

02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that this speaks to
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
it speaks to the bill in that it's
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
authorizing more people to choose
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.639 --> 02:18:19.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
i guess my question was
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
were you aware of the reactions too
 
02:18:25.439 --> 02:18:26.230 align:start position:0%
were you aware of the reactions too
that

02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
that apparently
 
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.509 align:start position:0%
that apparently
from

02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know and so i'm trying to think
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
of how to say are you aware of any kind
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
of fact sheet
 
02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
of fact sheet
on

02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
the hpv or any of the vaccines that
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
parents or
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
people over 18 currently
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
are made aware of the potential
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
serious ramifications of taking these
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
like especially the hpv
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
so the cdc does issue vaccine
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
information statements that accompany
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
the vaccination
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
consent sheets so that people are made
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
aware of whatever the current data
 
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.030 align:start position:0%
aware of whatever the current data
and

02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
relevant information is when making
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
any other questions

how does a 16 year old
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
acquire that informed
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
consent when we
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
when what's developed is we
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
you can't even question
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
the vaccine you can't we can't discuss
 
02:19:44.559 --> 02:19:46.790 align:start position:0%
the vaccine you can't we can't discuss
it

02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
results from other countries and so
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
forth are being censored
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
so how does a child
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
receive enough information to make an
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
informed consent without their parents
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative acton i think i would i
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
would add that by the time an adolescent
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
is usually between the ages and 14 14
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and 16 they usually have very pretty
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
must pretty much um advanced critical
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
thinking skills they can review
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
information and make decisions
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
um they you know should certainly have
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
as the previous the sponsor the bill
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
suggested if they have open
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
communication with their parents they
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
should be able to have those
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
conversations about risks and benefits
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
um certainly if a 16 year old wanted to
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
get a vaccine
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
they could access their provider if they
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
had access to the provider
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
and you know the the department feels
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
that kova the coven 19 vaccine for
 
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
adolescents often offers high benefit
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
and low risk
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
with that i closed the hearing on house
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
now just to let us know where we're
 
02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:08.710 align:start position:0%
now just to let us know where we're
heading

02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
i plan on breaking for lunch at 12 15
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
that will give us an opportunity to
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 16
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
54 and my suspicion is we will continue
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
after the lunch break
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
house this opens the hearing on house

1979 we've pretty much had an open book

1979 we've pretty much had an open book
on

partial birth abortion ban
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
and a few other

and a few other
and

02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:58.080 --> 02:22:59.270 align:start position:0%
and
peripheral

02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
peripheral
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
protections against the unborn and
 
02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
protections against the unborn and
pre-born

02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
pre-born
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
but now
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
effective on january 1 of course we've
 
02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.389 align:start position:0%
effective on january 1 of course we've
got

02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
hb 625 within the hb2
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the 24 week
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
ban on abortions from 24 weeks forward
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
so now
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
we do not have any ability to measure
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy terminations may take place
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
before or after
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
and hopefully not after because that
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of law
 
02:23:40.399 --> 02:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of law
so

02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
we really need to have health care
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
statistics like we already have
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
in so many areas throughout
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
involving many
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
health care
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
health situations
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
except pregnancy termination statistics
 
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
except pregnancy termination statistics
now

02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
this is not a new attempt um
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know we've had several
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
runs at this before
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
hb 158 was a bill that i sponsored last
 
02:24:18.399 --> 02:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
hb 158 was a bill that i sponsored last
term

02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then there was sb
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
111 of 2019
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
and even going back to
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
471 of 2017 and maybe there's more
 
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:33.750 align:start position:0%
471 of 2017 and maybe there's more
but

02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
the process has been helpful
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
to take objections to those bills and to
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
make remedy through amendments and then
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
successive issues of the bills
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the point where i think we've got the
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
problems ironed out
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
but that's for you to say
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
um i have passed out amendment
 
02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:04.790 align:start position:0%
um i have passed out amendment
2022-230238h

02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
let me run over those briefly
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
because they affect the bill in
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
important ways
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph in there
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
parenthetical d
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
published report an annual report
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
commencing with data to be reported as
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
of january 1st 2023
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
the delayed date gives the department
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
time to
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
set up the necessary protocols
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
forms and data processes for reporting
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
and again it restates no data shall be
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
released to the department that would
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to personally identify
 
02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:48.870 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to personally identify
either

02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
the health care provider who performed
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
an induced termination of pregnancy or
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
the patient on whom it was performed
 
02:25:57.920 --> 02:25:59.429 align:start position:0%
the patient on whom it was performed
except

02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
except
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
pursuant a search warrant issued under
 
02:26:05.429 --> 02:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
rsa 595 a
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
now we didn't have that in prior bills
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
but since we do have the 24-week
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
ban on abortions
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
now there is that possibility that there
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
might be a violation
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
and if there's a violation in the
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
process of investigation and law
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
we we need to make sure that
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
certain information might be available
 
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
going on further
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%

02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph that follows
 
02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.349 align:start position:0%
paragraph that follows
and

02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
that is pretty much a housekeeping thing
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
we heretofore referred to the new
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire health wisdom system
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
which has
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
a great deal of helpful information and
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
about all kinds of health care
 
02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:14.309 align:start position:0%
about all kinds of health care
situations

02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
but that is being morphed into um the
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services data portal if
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
you go on and you google wisdom
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
it'll bring you into a new face on
 
02:27:26.399 --> 02:27:27.750 align:start position:0%
it'll bring you into a new face on
screen

02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
which is identified as the health and
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
human services data portal so these
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
things changed so we wanted to make sure
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
that we weren't
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
hemmed into
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
the next paragraph data may be person
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
that may personally identify either the
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
health care provider who performed an
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
induced termination of pregnancy
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
or the patient on whom it was performed
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
shall be exempt from disclosure
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of rsa 91a
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
of course we don't want
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
any of that information
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
out on a out in the public
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
leaking out to violate the privacy of
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
the provider or
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
so that's an important component
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure 91a isn't used as a
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
leverage to procure this sensitive
 
02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:28.309 align:start position:0%
leverage to procure this sensitive
information

02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
and then the last paragraph on the
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
any data collected pursuant rsa 126
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
colon 25 that may personally identify
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
either the health care provider who
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
performed an induced termination of
 
02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:45.830 align:start position:0%
performed an induced termination of
pregnancy

02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
or the patient on whom it was performed
 
02:28:52.349 --> 02:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
this exemption shall not include
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
non-identifying information required to
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
be disclosed under rsa 126 colon 25.
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
so um only the collection dissemination
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
of authorized
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
data with all of the restrictions we've
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
built into
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
all the restrictions that are already in
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
the body of law in 126
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the restrictions that the federal
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
people have in hipaa
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're not interested
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
in individuals
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
knowing individuals who may have had an
 
02:29:30.399 --> 02:29:32.469 align:start position:0%
knowing individuals who may have had an
abortion

02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
or and the providers to those
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
we want the data
 
02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
our society runs on data and information
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's how we grow and improve
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
here we have a big blind spot without
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
any termination of pregnancy statistics
 
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.190 align:start position:0%
any termination of pregnancy statistics
numbers

02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
so how can we understand
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
make remedy for
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
improve our situation of health if we
 
02:30:06.389 --> 02:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
have a big gap and void
 
02:30:09.429 --> 02:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
and and i would say that this bill will
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
help close that gap
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it will put this element of data and
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
information into the already existing
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
body of law
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
in rsa 6 126
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
title 10.
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of precautions
 
02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of precautions
guards

02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
and even penalties for violation
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
collection or dissemination
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
and even failure to report
 
02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:44.550 align:start position:0%
and even failure to report
properly

02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
data for the system
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
we've attempted to cover all of the
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
bases in here taking from the prior
 
02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:59.190 align:start position:0%
bases in here taking from the prior
bills

02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
the good stuff and adding
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
the the information and the components
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
that you all had mentioned on previous
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to restate that we have no
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
interest in knowing the individuals
 
02:31:16.319 --> 02:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
interest in knowing the individuals
involved

02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
in the termination of pregnancy
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
we want the data
 
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:24.389 align:start position:0%
we want the data
and

02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
the whole country
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
utilizes data we're one of only three
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
states that has not reported to the cdc
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
maryland california and new hampshire
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill will enable that
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
black spot to be
 
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
see the light of day with regard to the
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
statistics and join the other
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
states that have already been reporting
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
close with that and
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
be willing to answer questions as they
 
02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:03.429 align:start position:0%
be willing to answer questions as they
are

02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
i have one representative and thank you
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
for testifying today um would you
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
believe that i faced the same thing as
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
chairman of two
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
deaf and hard of hearing committees in
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
this state that new hampshire for some
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
reason known only to god is data phobic
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i would believe that thank
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton for taking my
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is a um these bills have one been
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
ones that have puzzled me um
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
since i first started hearing them and i
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
i have to agree that i don't understand
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
why this care procedure is treated so
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
differently than others
 
02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
um that being said i have a couple of
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions about your bill
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
one is does the does the bill actually
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
say what data is to be collected and
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
aggregated or is that is that
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
specifically in an rsa that
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
the bill refers to
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
this bill does bring forward from prior
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
attempts the type of data
 
02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is to be collected and it'll be on
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
in

02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
starting at line
 
02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:30.630 align:start position:0%
starting at line
four

02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
that gives you the detail that
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
of determination by month and year
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
method of termination
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
and there's four
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
general categories that are covered in
 
02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.990 align:start position:0%
general categories that are covered in
that

02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
i apologize i was just looking at the
 
02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:48.870 align:start position:0%
i apologize i was just looking at the
amendment

02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:53.349 --> 02:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a there's a
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
question of whether the data should be
 
02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
question of whether the data should be
aggregated

02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
aggregated
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
by the department of health and human
 
02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
by the department of health and human
services

02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
or whether it should be aggrava ag
 
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
aggravated um this is kind of
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
aggravating um aggregated
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
prior to being sent from the the medical
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
providers who
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
perform abortions
 
02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
perform abortions
and

02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:24.319 --> 02:34:25.429 align:start position:0%
 
some

02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
it would be an inadequate to have the
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
providers themselves aggregate the data
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
before it gets sent to health and human
 
02:34:35.439 --> 02:34:37.270 align:start position:0%
before it gets sent to health and human
services

02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um i'm
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%

aggregate summary means a compilation of
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
the information received
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%

pregnancy
 
02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
so by the definition
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's putting that responsibility
 
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
upon the health and human services
 
02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:13.510 align:start position:0%

02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton to take my
 
02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.429 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton to take my
question

02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire we have a
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
long history of privacy
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
and we have actually in our constitution
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's an article two
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the bill of rights specifically talks
 
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
about an individual right to live free
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
from governmental intrusion and private
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
or personal information natural and
 
02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:43.830 align:start position:0%
or personal information natural and
central

02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
central
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
and that's inherent
 
02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:46.309 align:start position:0%
and that's inherent
and

02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
when i look at this bill
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's a violation of the
 
02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
constitution because we're asking for
 
02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
people to provide information that's
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
private and
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
if we're really going to abide by the
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
constitution of privacy
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
should we not at that point in time
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
respect that and if a patient wants to
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
have it submitted like we do with other
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
things maybe the patient should have the
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
right to opt out
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore we can then bring it to
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
the patient so the patient has that
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
right to opt out
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
when you deal with
 
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
when you deal with
privacy

02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's another bill before us i think
 
02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:23.469 align:start position:0%
there's another bill before us i think
it's

02:36:23.469 --> 02:36:23.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:36:23.479 --> 02:36:25.110 align:start position:0%
it's
1662

02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
1662
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with the department health and
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
human services about security and
 
02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
human services about security and
privacy

02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
and trying to beep up our system from
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
being hacked
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
so people have data in the system that
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
we can protect their
 
02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
we can protect their
privacy

02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
not just the security but the privacy of
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
the data
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that i think in
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
how this does not violate the
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
constitution and does it subject the
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
patient to the potential for getting
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
hacked into a database
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question
 
02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:56.230 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question
representative

02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:57.110 align:start position:0%
representative
and

02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
i do believe that uh privacy is a very
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
important and an essential component of
 
02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
our system
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's why we spent a great deal of time
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
over three attempts at this bill
 
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure data in the aggregate and
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
no identifying data would be
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
attended to
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
the collection of the
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
of the statistics and the dissemination
 
02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
of them in the
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
health care portal
 
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.110 align:start position:0%
health care portal
or

02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
for the department in other areas
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so if you read through the bill they
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
talk about the creation of confidential
 
02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:46.309 align:start position:0%
talk about the creation of confidential
codes

02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
codes
 
02:37:46.319 --> 02:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
codes
that

02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
that
represent

02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
but not identify the patients and the
 
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.270 align:start position:0%
but not identify the patients and the
providers

02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
except by
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
location of
 
02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:58.630 align:start position:0%
location of
city

02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
and county and so forth except
 
02:38:04.389 --> 02:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
if there's uh a location that's
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
underneath 20 000
 
02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
underneath 20 000
then

02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
what would you say diluted so that there
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
an identification by people who could
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
maybe somehow
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
think that they they could identify or
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
assume to identify some people
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that it's a violation
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
of our constitutional rights either
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
state or federal
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
to collect this data
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
we collect data
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
all over on different types of diseases
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it's important for us to be able to
 
02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:46.389 align:start position:0%
and it's important for us to be able to
know

02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do about diseases
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we collect data on and give us
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
indications where we have problems
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
not unlike the the p5s problem that we
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
have in the state
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we continue to collect data because
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an expanding
 
02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:04.950 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an expanding
awareness

02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
we need an expanding awareness on
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
something that's been voided
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
out of our health care statistics and
 
02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
that is pregnancy termination
 
02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:18.070 align:start position:0%
that is pregnancy termination
and

02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know not only from decided or
 
02:39:23.349 --> 02:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
willful abortion but for
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
health reasons and surgical for
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
miscarriages and toxic pregnancies and
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth
 
02:39:34.469 --> 02:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
we have a right of privacy
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
under our constitution
 
02:39:39.270 --> 02:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
but that privacy does not
 
02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
trump the other articles of our
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
law under the constitution and it
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't trump the right of the state to
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
be able to provide
 
02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
security safety
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
health care oversight whatever you will
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
and to do this we protect the right of
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the individuals by
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
keeping them out of the data out of
 
02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:06.150 align:start position:0%
keeping them out of the data out of
dissemination

02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
dissemination
 
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
but yet meet our mission and goal to
 
02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:10.710 align:start position:0%
but yet meet our mission and goal to
understand

02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh what our health situation is in so
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
many areas so that we could do the best
 
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
to remedy shortfalls and to progress in
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
better health care
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
if we're looking for the
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
data the aggregation of the data which
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
is basically we call patient d
 
02:40:36.319 --> 02:40:37.830 align:start position:0%
is basically we call patient d
identified

02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
why not have the data that's going to be
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
submitted by the provider go into the
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
department health and services
 
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
patient d identifies in other words the
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
provider is not providing any patient
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
names and
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
numbers and so forth so you can still
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
collect the data without submitting
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
anybody's personal information with that
 
02:40:54.479 --> 02:40:55.590 align:start position:0%
anybody's personal information with that
data

02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
could that possibly be done so basically
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
what's going into the department is in
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
fact de-identified before it gets to the
 
02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
fact de-identified before it gets to the
department

02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
so at that point in time it's really not
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
violating our privacy because it's been
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
de-identified we don't have to worry
 
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
about something hacking into the system
 
02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
because it's been de-identified but we
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
still at the end of the day you get
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
aggregated data
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your your question um
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
enables the uh identif
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
enables a code coding system
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
um for the
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
provider as well as the patient
 
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
confident and these are confidential
 
02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:35.750 align:start position:0%
confident and these are confidential
numbers

02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
the provider will provide the data on
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
that basis
 
02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:44.070 align:start position:0%
that basis
and

02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
that data comes to the health and human
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
services department and is going to be
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
held in confidentiality according to the
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
law under 126 title 10.
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
and we've already had several years
 
02:41:59.439 --> 02:42:00.550 align:start position:0%
and we've already had several years
of

02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
operation of 126 and
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any data breaches
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
or hacking attempts that has
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
purloined any information
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
of any type of healthcare situation from
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
the database now maybe health and human
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
services can speak better to that
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
question if they've had a breach
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
and how they've had a breach
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
and what was the extent of that
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
but remember
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
126 is a well-established body of law
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:42:35.439 --> 02:42:36.309 align:start position:0%
relative to
health

02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
care and health statistics
 
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
and there are penalties for
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh the breach
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
of dissemination of this information
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
it's a class b felony
 
02:42:48.399 --> 02:42:49.590 align:start position:0%
it's a class b felony
and

02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
for the provider to misstep
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
and falsely report or fail or to report
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
under the protocols which will be
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
established by health and human services
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
that under 126 colon 29 that brings a
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
fine of a hundred dollars a day
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
for every day of non-compliance
 
02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.230 align:start position:0%
for every day of non-compliance
so

02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:15.429 align:start position:0%
so
between

02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to the law we have the
 
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
experience and the professionalism of
 
02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services department
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
that has been working on these systems
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
for years
 
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i think they can better testify that
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they've had
 
02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:31.269 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they've had
significant

02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
breaches if any at all but they have to
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
testify to that
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
and welcome back and thank you for
 
02:43:48.790 --> 02:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to follow up on the use
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
of a patient's confidential
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
identification code or number
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
i i think really i'm trying to follow up
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
on representative shapiro's question
 
02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
on representative shapiro's question
about

02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
aggregating at the provider level versus
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
aggregating at the department level
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
and so if you are aggregating at the
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
provider level they're going to
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
give a report that says cheshire county
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the number
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
of cases
 
02:44:29.279 --> 02:44:29.990 align:start position:0%
of cases
i

02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
i can't understand why
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
the aggregation would be done at the
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
department level which provides one more
 
02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:40.710 align:start position:0%
department level which provides one more
opportunity

02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:44:44.469 --> 02:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
for an individual's number to be
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
worked backwards into a personal
 
02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:48.230 align:start position:0%
worked backwards into a personal
identity

02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
identity
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
rather than having
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
the information be aggregated
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
and given that we are a state
 
02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:01.830 align:start position:0%
and given that we are a state
where

02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
there are an awful lot of real small
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
towns and i appreciate that the bill
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
provides that you will only report by
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
county if you're above
 
02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:13.030 align:start position:0%
county if you're above
if

02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
if your town is below 20 000 in
 
02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
if your town is below 20 000 in
population

02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
sorry i wonder
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
about the trade-off
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
between privacy which we're all
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about and protecting the
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
individual's identity
 
02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
individual's identity
and

02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
getting to the point where the data
 
02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
isn't particularly useful
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
i i certainly would prefer to see
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
county-wide reporting but
 
02:45:46.319 --> 02:45:47.590 align:start position:0%
county-wide reporting but
um

02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
i have the two questions one being the
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
aggregation at
 
02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
the facility level rather than at the
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
department level and the other is
 
02:45:57.359 --> 02:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
department level and the other is
just

02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
the trade-off between trying to balance
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
the privacy with the usefulness of the
 
02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:07.990 align:start position:0%
the privacy with the usefulness of the
statistics

02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
the short answer would be for
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
is going to administer
 
02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:23.429 align:start position:0%
is going to administer
the

02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:23.439 --> 02:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
the
data

02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
computer program if you will
 
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the forms to be used during the
 
02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:32.950 align:start position:0%
and the forms to be used during the
process

02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's the hub of the wheel if
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
you have every one of the spokes on the
 
02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:38.790 align:start position:0%
you have every one of the spokes on the
wheel

02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
wheel
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
aggregating or furnishing data
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
at their own
 
02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
choice of importance or evaluation of
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
importance then
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get good data we have
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
to do this in an organized fashion and
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
the department would be the base
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
to create and
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
facilitate the system as well as to
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
provide the forms and the questions that
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be asked on there and they
 
02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
are going to be asked on there and they
also

02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
will be the ones in charge of keeping
 
02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
secure the the codes that are utilized
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
for this reporting
 
02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:18.389 align:start position:0%
for this reporting
um

02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
where you you can secure or you can
 
02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:25.429 align:start position:0%
where you you can secure or you can
assure

02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
assure
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
the quality of data by letting the
 
02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
spokes on that wheel determine to what
 
02:47:33.269 --> 02:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
extent they're going to combine
 
02:47:33.279 --> 02:47:34.630 align:start position:0%
extent they're going to combine
aggregate

02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:37.110 align:start position:0%
aggregate
report

02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
the data and i think it has to be a
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
highly disciplined system so that we a
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
protect the privacy of the individual by
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
the codification
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
and b get the quality of data that will
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
be useful
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh and important to us
 
02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that answers your
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um as our
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist isn't here today could i
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
make a statement on the data as an
 
02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:07.110 align:start position:0%
make a statement on the data as an
analyst

02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
analyst
 
02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
no no no no you can't okay that we had
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
had the other people before so were you
 
02:48:23.429 --> 02:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you then i'll proceed to my
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
questions i just know we've done that
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
with other people as well in the past
 
02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:32.150 align:start position:0%
with other people as well in the past
um

02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
when we look at this information and the
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
importance of having the information
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
available to the department of health
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and human services so that they can
 
02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually make use of this important data
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
i do know that it makes sense to
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
have the
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
greatest granularity that does not
 
02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
compromise patient safety so that the
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
department would be able to run
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful analyses upon this
 
02:48:55.359 --> 02:48:56.469 align:start position:0%
meaningful analyses upon this
information

02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
um i think that this information could
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
really help us with health equity and
 
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
disparity if we do find that vulnerable
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
populations are going to uh are seeing
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionate use of this service and
 
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about whether race and
 
02:49:11.439 --> 02:49:12.469 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about whether race and
ethnicity

02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
ethnicity
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
income and parity meaning the number of
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
previous births or pregnancies were left
 
02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
out to protect privacy or if those are
 
02:49:20.469 --> 02:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
something that could let us see if
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations are
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
utilizing the service more than others
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
in our community
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that interesting question
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see a breakout for
 
02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:34.870 align:start position:0%
i don't see a breakout for
race

02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
race
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
or other criteria
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it focuses on
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
the physical aspects of why and how
 
02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
abortions are taking place
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
as well as other pregnancy terminations
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
but that's an interesting
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
question and maybe
 
02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
at some point that department might find
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
that useful and bring us a request for a
 
02:50:05.110 --> 02:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill to provide additional aspects
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
but this one does not have that in-depth
 
02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:09.110 align:start position:0%
but this one does not have that in-depth
breakout

02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
breakout
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
the church disappointed that there was
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
no one
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
lined up
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
to answer all the
 
02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
hard technical questions of privacy and
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
so on however
 
02:50:25.750 --> 02:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
our friends at dhhs provided me with the
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
numbers of people i have calls out to
 
02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
them i will continue because they can
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
answer the
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
vital records questions and safety and
 
02:50:39.110 --> 02:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
all of these issues that we have before
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
us i hope to get them here for the
 
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
continuation of this hearing after lunch
 
02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:45.269 align:start position:0%
continuation of this hearing after lunch
but

02:50:45.269 --> 02:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see so we will now
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
break for lunch and resume at one
 
02:50:49.920 --> 03:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
break for lunch and resume at one
o'clock

03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 1654
 
03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:16.389 align:start position:0%
house bill 1654
and

03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if representative merchant
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
would address
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative stapleton with some of
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
the questions we're trying to come to
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
to yes here and i think we're on the way
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
but for the sake of everybody would you
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
raise your questions and and do a little
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
bit of dialogue back and forth i realize
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh this isn't the exact session but we
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
have the sponsor with the answers here
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i may um given the time
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
and the hour of the day
 
03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
could i possibly have a conversation
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
stapleton and then possibly come back to
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
an exact session with some solutions to
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
the questions that certainly could be
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
possible but the hour of the day
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
question is house bill 1180 for those of
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
you here for it will be postponed until
 
03:41:03.990 --> 03:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
february 22nd i'll call that in
 
03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
to being and then recess it um
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
so we do have some time before our next
 
03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
so we do have some time before our next
hearing

03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you wish if you wish i i
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman but i think the conversation
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
like to have with
 
03:41:21.910 --> 03:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton is a very
 
03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
detailed very lengthy conversation and i
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
think the better place for us is to have
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
it offline and further i would encourage
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to mr chairman is to appoint
 
03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
a couple of other people with us to have
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc group and talk about the issue
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
in more detail and come back with
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
something that's meaningful to the
 
03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
something that's meaningful to the
committee

03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah absolutely we can do that um
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
if the representative uh would wish to
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
continue from where we left off
 
03:41:51.269 --> 03:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chair and members of
 
03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%

representative knurk
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and pleasure to have
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
you back again i did have a question
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
though um
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
earlier you made a comment about
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
you kind of made some comparisons to
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
other diseases and to pfas into
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
gathering data we really need to address
 
03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:28.070 align:start position:0%
gathering data we really need to address
problems

03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
and since this actually is not a disease
 
03:42:33.030 --> 03:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
nor an environmental toxin but it's an
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
elective surgical procedure
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
with a low risk profile or an electric
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
medical procedure since medical is
 
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
included i'm curious what the
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
perceived problem is that you
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
think we need this data in order to
 
03:42:47.199 --> 03:42:49.349 align:start position:0%
think we need this data in order to
address

03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
when they had
 
03:42:55.110 --> 03:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
the wisdom
 
03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
graphic system up and alive and working
 
03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
very well
 
03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
before they started making changes and
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
morphing it into the new hampshire
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
health data portal
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
you could go in there and search any
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
number of
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
health subjects
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
and get various aspects almost like
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
custom build
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
what information you could derive i
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that in the new hampshire
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
data portal at this point yet maybe
 
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's coming
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i looked at pregnancy
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
and there are there was a whole
 
03:43:33.510 --> 03:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of nice data relative to
 
03:43:36.870 --> 03:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancies by age
 
03:43:38.950 --> 03:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
by difficulties and
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
any number of things but it was missing
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
the aspect of termination of pregnancy
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things this bill would do is
 
03:43:51.510 --> 03:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
to insert that aspect of
 
03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:53.429 align:start position:0%
to insert that aspect of
information

03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:43:53.439 --> 03:43:54.550 align:start position:0%
information
into

03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
that non-identifiable aggregated data
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
so that we could understand how many for
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
instance how many per uh how many
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
terminations are occurring in the state
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
and of the four or five categories
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes well that tells us the
 
03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
data but what is the perceived problem
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
for which we need to gather this data
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
because you talked about
 
03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:25.189 align:start position:0%
because you talked about
problems

03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:44:25.199 --> 03:44:26.150 align:start position:0%
problems
um

03:44:26.150 --> 03:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:27.110 align:start position:0%
um
which

03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
and even on the other things i mean
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
we talked about problems what is the
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
perceived problem for which we have to
 
03:44:37.269 --> 03:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
gather the data as to the numbers
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that is
 
03:44:41.990 --> 03:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
was my perception
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
of the use of that word
 
03:44:44.479 --> 03:44:45.429 align:start position:0%
of the use of that word
and

03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
i personally believe that abortion
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
is a problem
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're taking the life
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
of a potential citizen
 
03:44:57.269 --> 03:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
of a human being
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
and abortion occurs at any
 
03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
weeks

03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
in during the pregnancy except now
 
03:45:10.790 --> 03:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
not on or after the 24th week so we
 
03:45:12.870 --> 03:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
still want the data
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
to know how many are done in the state
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
is an important thing
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
um and under what procedures
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
that they are being done
 
03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:24.950 align:start position:0%
that they are being done
and

03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
there may be a breakdown of other
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
information that can come out of looking
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
at those counts against the procedure
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
specified in the bill
 
03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:35.110 align:start position:0%
specified in the bill
and

03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know it comes under health care and
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
health statistics in 126 so
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
to me it's a shoe-fit
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
shoe that fits
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily a problem for many
 
03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:49.670 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily a problem for many
people

03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
of perception
 
03:45:54.550 --> 03:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
mine maybe but um
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
problem or not a problem we should know
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
if we have a problem or not a problem
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
and how many of these terminations and
 
03:46:05.189 --> 03:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
how they're happening in the state
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
may i be allowed another follow-up
 
03:46:08.790 --> 03:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
another follow-up but generally a
 
03:46:10.469 --> 03:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
problem is because you perceive there's
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed to
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
be changed so for example we might
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
let's take something else that's
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
elective and this is really not a good
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
analogy but
 
03:46:22.150 --> 03:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
i mean just any other kind of elective
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
procedure we wouldn't view it as a
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.950 --> 03:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
oh oh i'm sorry
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
am i oh
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry i did not realize i'm not
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
usually i was hearing you i'm okay okay
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
well yeah basically usually we are
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
speaking about a problem gathering data
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can make an intervention to
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
alter it so
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
for example if we have a high rate of
 
03:46:44.550 --> 03:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality we might want to find
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
out what the factors are so we can
 
03:46:46.870 --> 03:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
address those
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
um so what is the perceived problem here
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
when it's an elective
 
03:46:50.399 --> 03:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
when it's an elective
procedure

03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
either medical or surgical
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
of an individual
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
what is the perceived problem
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.469 --> 03:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
we're not going to this bill is not
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to measure
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
the follow-on after a termination of
 
03:47:08.960 --> 03:47:10.150 align:start position:0%
the follow-on after a termination of
pregnancy

03:47:10.150 --> 03:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's no provision for that intrusive
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
look into
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
problems that occur during the abortion
 
03:47:19.120 --> 03:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
problems that occur during the abortion
where

03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
a woman's life and health is at risk
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
because of the abortion
 
03:47:25.600 --> 03:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
because of the abortion
um

03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
now maybe down the road in the future
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
that might be something but not in this
 
03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
that might be something but not in this
bill

03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
and we probably shouldn't use the word
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
problem because it's a matter of law
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
we have roe v wade and planned
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
parenthood versus casey and doe versus
 
03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
parenthood versus casey and doe versus
bolton

03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
bolton
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's where the determination is if
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be any remedies if that
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
law changes
 
03:47:51.439 --> 03:47:52.790 align:start position:0%
law changes
so

03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not going to use this
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
data to address any particular aspect of
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
the procedures involved in termination
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
of pregnancy
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
but if we see a problem
 
03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:06.389 align:start position:0%
but if we see a problem
that

03:48:06.389 --> 03:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:09.030 --> 03:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
or or indication from the data that
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:48:13.349 --> 03:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
a large number of pregnancy terminations
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
in one particular procedure or another
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
that may be beneficial to the medical
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
community to
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
address modify um examine evaluate
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of data
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to pin the
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
tail on the donkey here we don't want to
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
know who the individuals are
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
we don't even want to know who the
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
providers are in the public information
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
but we want to know the extent of this
 
03:48:41.680 --> 03:48:43.110 align:start position:0%
but we want to know the extent of this
practice

03:48:43.110 --> 03:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:48:43.120 --> 03:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
practice
because

03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:48:47.590 --> 03:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
since 1973
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's estimated there have been 62
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
million abortions in the united states
 
03:48:53.040 --> 03:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
million abortions in the united states
now

03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
that comes from a combination of sources
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
including the guttmacher institute which
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
is the prime research arm of planned
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
parenthood where it was they may have
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
split now
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of people that's like
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
one-third of our population total we got
 
03:49:13.189 --> 03:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
340 million people
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
now i would classify that as a problem
 
03:49:17.670 --> 03:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
these are future citizens this is a loss
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
of resource
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
this is a want and waste
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
we want to know to what extent new
 
03:49:27.030 --> 03:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire may be participating
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
and know whether we're
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
about like the same as other states more
 
03:49:37.590 --> 03:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
or less relative to our population
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
of what 1.34 million people
 
03:49:44.550 --> 03:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative leon has a question
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:49:47.910 --> 03:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:49:47.920 --> 03:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
taking my question
i

03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
was looking to see what the cdc uses it
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
for and i appreciate that you're
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
probably more interested in the
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
calculated the national legal induced
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
abortion case fatality rate but you are
 
03:49:59.349 --> 03:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
aware are you aware that three other
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
things they do are to evaluate the
 
03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
success of programs aimed at promoting
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
equitable access to patient-centered
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
quality contraceptive services in the
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
u.s to calculate pregnancy rates rates
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
based on the number of pregnancies
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
ending in abortion along with the
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
collected birth data and to monitor
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
changes in clinical practice
 
03:50:19.269 --> 03:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
in relation to this are you aware that
 
03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
the cdc uses it that way
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's interesting that's an interesting
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i can see the applicability for that
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
because our population replacement rate
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
is somewhere
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
is it you know 9 4 or 1.10 or something
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
and it should be
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
like two
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
because it takes two people to make a
 
03:50:46.239 --> 03:50:47.670 align:start position:0%
because it takes two people to make a
pregnancy

03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
and

03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:48.800 --> 03:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
and
we're

03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
for a society to grow and flourish it
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
needs to replace at least those two
 
03:50:55.750 --> 03:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
people and if we're
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know 0.94 or 1.10 or whatever the
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
figure is now
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
we're not making it
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
except maybe by illegal immigration
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
um but that's another subject we're not
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to go there but
 
03:51:12.150 --> 03:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
i see from your question that that what
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
we want to do fits in to the scope of
 
03:51:17.670 --> 03:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
the overall development of knowledge
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
to help us understand where we go as a
 
03:51:22.229 --> 03:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
population and as a culture
 
03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm breaking what i just said about
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
holding this off but i wanted to make a
 
03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
holding this off but i wanted to make a
comment

03:51:34.150 --> 03:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.160 --> 03:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:51:36.550 --> 03:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
kyle asked a question
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:40.630 --> 03:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
would you believe okay
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
go back to i mentioned before we have a
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
probably in a lot of ways leading the
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
country because one of the things i'm
 
03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
seeing now is when i go on to websites
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
is i have the option with the cookies i
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
can choose what information i want to
 
03:51:55.920 --> 03:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
can choose what information i want to
share

03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
share
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
i have that option now
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
when i go back to this basic bill
 
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to consider an opt
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
out we talked about this before this is
 
03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:09.750 align:start position:0%
out we talked about this before this is
a

03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
patient's information it doesn't belong
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the government's hand unless the
 
03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
patient consents to it that's kind of
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have a constitution
 
03:52:17.439 --> 03:52:18.469 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have a constitution
here

03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
article 4 in the bill of rights
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to allow the
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
patient to opt out sharing that data
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
because it really is their data not the
 
03:52:26.880 --> 03:52:28.950 align:start position:0%
because it really is their data not the
governments

03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
governments
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and i
 
03:52:30.560 --> 03:52:32.469 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and i
appreciate

03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
your emphasis on privacy and i concur
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
with its uh valued importance in our
 
03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
culture and in our law
 
03:52:44.309 --> 03:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to create undue confusion
 
03:52:44.319 --> 03:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
you're going to create undue confusion
and

03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
impair the
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
value of the record by letting people
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to protect privacy because
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're not interested in the identity of
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
either the patient or the provider and
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're structuring
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
within the bill those protections and
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
we've already developed those
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
protections in
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
and if you want if you don't want to
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
have well the term was dirty data the
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
last go around of hearings that we had
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you'd like the data to be
 
03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
good data
 
03:53:27.269 --> 03:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
um useful data
 
03:53:27.279 --> 03:53:29.590 align:start position:0%
um useful data
then

03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
opt out is is not necessary
 
03:53:35.349 --> 03:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
advisable in order to get the
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
statistics that we ultimately want and
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's all we want is the numbers the
 
03:53:43.120 --> 03:53:47.429 align:start position:0%
that's all we want is the numbers the
statistics

03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative would you say there's a
 
03:53:49.199 --> 03:53:50.630 align:start position:0%
representative would you say there's a
difference

03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
between an opt-in or opt-out question
 
03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
when it has to do with somebody's name
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
versus opt-in opt-out
 
03:54:01.750 --> 03:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
the provider is the one that keeps the
 
03:54:09.600 --> 03:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
the provider is the one that keeps the
detail

03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
detail
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
can they opt out to expunge their record
 
03:54:17.199 --> 03:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
can they opt out to expunge their record
from

03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
from
well

03:54:20.550 --> 03:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know you see doctors and
 
03:54:26.630 --> 03:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
facilities are supposed to keep records
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
about the procedures they conduct and
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
the patients that they treat
 
03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:32.950 align:start position:0%
the patients that they treat
now

03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to upload that
 
03:54:38.469 --> 03:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
information to the system
 
03:54:38.479 --> 03:54:39.429 align:start position:0%
information to the system
the

03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:41.590 --> 03:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
makes the code
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
all of the patient data doesn't get
 
03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
all of the patient data doesn't get
uploaded

03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
uploaded
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
from the provider's files
 
03:54:54.870 --> 03:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
the code against the four or five
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
termination of predicate categories
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
is the only thing that the department is
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
if you want to know who the patient is
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
then you've got to go to the provider
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
and the systems that have been developed
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
by the state of new hampshire and other
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
states protecting data of all kinds
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
privacy data according to hipaa and
 
03:55:19.990 --> 03:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
state regulations
 
03:55:22.150 --> 03:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
has been pretty successful
 
03:55:24.790 --> 03:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
and you know that you can't just walk in
 
03:55:26.710 --> 03:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
a hospital and get data on anybody
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
because there's a great deal of concern
 
03:55:32.710 --> 03:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
the provider information
 
03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:36.630 align:start position:0%
the provider information
that

03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
the provider takes
 
03:55:42.790 --> 03:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
stays in the files of of the provider
 
03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:43.990 align:start position:0%
stays in the files of of the provider
now

03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem with a leakage
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
or a dissemination
 
03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's not the state that's going to be
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
able to do that it's the provider that's
 
03:55:54.630 --> 03:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
going to be vulnerable to that if he
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
fails to have safeguards
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
for protecting that information
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're not interested in getting that
 
03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
information all of that detail uploaded
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
because then there'll be no control over
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
it and what if it changes what are you
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to do updates to all that
 
03:56:08.960 --> 03:56:12.710 align:start position:0%
going to do updates to all that
information

03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:20.309 --> 03:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chair and thank you
 
03:56:22.389 --> 03:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question this is a
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up to i think both represent to
 
03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative leon's uh comment and
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
then something you said as well
 
03:56:34.150 --> 03:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
if what we're doing if the purpose
 
03:56:36.830 --> 03:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
behind this is to
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
both look at
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
the loss of potential citizens and also
 
03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:43.510 align:start position:0%
the loss of potential citizens and also
to

03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
figure out if there are areas or
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
populations that are underserved or
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
that are receiving
 
03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:52.950 align:start position:0%
that are receiving
less

03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
effective care than others
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't don't you agree that we should
 
03:56:59.830 --> 03:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
be also collecting miscarriage
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
statistics as well as abortion
 
03:57:04.630 --> 03:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
statistics so we can see
 
03:57:07.990 --> 03:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh which also reflect on levels of care
 
03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:10.070 align:start position:0%
uh which also reflect on levels of care
and

03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
failure of contraception
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
well no that wouldn't be a failure of
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
contraception but levels of care
 
03:57:15.600 --> 03:57:17.110 align:start position:0%
contraception but levels of care
available

03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
among other things and so for
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
epidemiological purposes would we
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better if we were
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
collecting both
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that interesting question
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
that adds some dynamic to
 
03:57:32.070 --> 03:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
the subject of data
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no because this bill
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't intend to address that but
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know in the into the future
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
um we might find a need for that and if
 
03:57:45.670 --> 03:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
so then a bill has to come forward to
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
authorize that
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill is narrow
 
03:57:53.990 --> 03:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
to find out the reasons
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
or the procedures
 
03:57:58.870 --> 03:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
for pregnancy termination and how many
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
it is a rather narrow focus admitted
 
03:58:03.439 --> 03:58:04.630 align:start position:0%
it is a rather narrow focus admitted
but

03:58:04.630 --> 03:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:58:04.640 --> 03:58:05.830 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
we wanted to be able to comply with
 
03:58:10.710 --> 03:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
data use
 
03:58:10.720 --> 03:58:11.429 align:start position:0%
data use
as

03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
reporting to the cdc
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
and also fill the gap in our data
 
03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
health care portal
 
03:58:23.590 --> 03:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
under the category of pregnancies
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question
 
03:58:26.319 --> 03:58:27.670 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question
since

03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
this data is collected in all but three
 
03:58:30.960 --> 03:58:32.550 align:start position:0%
this data is collected in all but three
states

03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of red states and there's
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of blue states
 
03:58:39.429 --> 03:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
do you know why they collect such data
 
03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're asking right
 
03:58:43.830 --> 03:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
now why do we need this well 47 states
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
seem to have a reason for that do you
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair for the question
 
03:58:55.830 --> 03:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
we believe that
 
03:58:55.840 --> 03:58:56.710 align:start position:0%
we believe that
pregnant

03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy termination is an important
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
subject and aspect of
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
health care and health condition in the
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
united states
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
and since we've had
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
roe v wade in
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
1973 that opened the door to the
 
03:59:16.150 --> 03:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
question of how many abortions are going
 
03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
to be taking place
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
under the new law then
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
and as we change the law as we have in
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
dough vs bolton and planned parenthood
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
versus casey and a number of other
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
supreme court decisions
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
we want to know to what extent when the
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
states want to know to what extent
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know are we increasing or decreasing
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
what where is that
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
human resource going how is it being
 
03:59:42.000 --> 03:59:43.990 align:start position:0%
human resource going how is it being
disposed

03:59:43.990 --> 03:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
disposed
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
and as i said before with 62 million
 
03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:48.309 align:start position:0%
and as i said before with 62 million
abortions

03:59:48.309 --> 03:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
estimated since 1973 this is a large
 
03:59:54.309 --> 03:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
impact on our culture our society our
 
03:59:54.319 --> 03:59:56.550 align:start position:0%
impact on our culture our society our
humanity

03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
and and even our national tradition so
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
for all of these reasons and
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
also for what the medical community can
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
gain out of information like this i
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
think it's vitally important
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
to have this component and states have
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
recognized that and i'm hoping new
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire through this bill
 
04:00:17.910 --> 04:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
can be
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
one of those reporters
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman my questions were
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
covered by representative weber
 
04:00:38.710 --> 04:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:41.429 --> 04:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
is actually two questions but
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
so if i'm allowed the liberty to ask one
 
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
and follow for the other
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
um regards to
 
04:00:52.150 --> 04:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
my medical record it's my medical record
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
it belongs to me not the provider
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
they're the holder of it but it belongs
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
to me personally has been decided by the
 
04:01:01.510 --> 04:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
courts many times
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to the data gets released by
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
the provider i have to sign a release
 
04:01:06.080 --> 04:01:07.990 align:start position:0%
the provider i have to sign a release
form

04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
form
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
no data goes to a billing company no
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
data goes to anyone else unless they're
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
involved with my care
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
so therefore i give them permission
 
04:01:19.030 --> 04:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
i sit down and sign a release form
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
i either opt in or opt out
 
04:01:23.429 --> 04:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
to that data being shared with anyone
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
else including the building department
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
now if i want to pay cash
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
i can opt out of sending the information
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the billing company but i have that
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
option i have that choice we're taking
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
this away
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
would you believe that that's my intent
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
here is that we're trying to protect the
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
patient's privacy and allowing them to
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
have control over that data
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
including what's in the medical record
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe that thank you for the
 
04:01:47.040 --> 04:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
would you believe that thank you for the
question

04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
we have laws on the books
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
patient data and
 
04:01:59.349 --> 04:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
your right to have and hold that data
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to transfer you can
 
04:02:03.429 --> 04:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
get a copy of it to physicians so on and
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the same thing
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about account
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the detail with
 
04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
your name on it with your medical
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
condition or conditions with the
 
04:02:18.150 --> 04:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
treatments you've had the physicians
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
you've seen
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
none of that
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be uploaded into the system
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
which is the reason for
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
the patient confidential number
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
going against a procedure
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
there there is no disclosure in that
 
04:02:34.239 --> 04:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
there there is no disclosure in that
process

04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
if you ask the department um
 
04:02:43.349 --> 04:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
who is that number
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
you've got to go back to the provider
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the provider is responsible
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
and under due process is supposed to be
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
protecting this information and enabling
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
you to get it
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
department is not going to be handling
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
that request or or that control
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
your provider is going to be work taken
 
04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
and condensing and if you will probably
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
you could even use the term aggregating
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
all of that into a number
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
on one procedure two procedure three or
 
04:03:14.880 --> 04:03:15.910 align:start position:0%
on one procedure two procedure three or
four

04:03:15.910 --> 04:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:03:15.920 --> 04:03:16.790 align:start position:0%
four
and

04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
the number goes into the department for
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
the count for the statistics
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
statistics we're not looking for the
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
detail we're looking for the statistics
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
just as a
 
04:03:32.640 --> 04:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
just as a
aside

04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
aside
 
04:03:35.830 --> 04:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe when i work at the
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
medical center we're
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
very concerned about patient data
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
and we had third parties involved with
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
us would you believe that we went to
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
great extents
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
a great extent to be sure that any
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
identifiable information including the
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
prescription number
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
which we think would be central and so
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
forth but it'd be traced back to the
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
patient so any kind of a number that
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
goes back to a patient's chart or back
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
to any kind of way can be traced back to
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
that patient
 
04:04:06.389 --> 04:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
so when you start we all talk about the
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
code a code links back to a patient
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's patient identifiable information
 
04:04:13.269 --> 04:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
although we have a disagreement on this
 
04:04:14.950 --> 04:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
and number two when you talk about the
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
issue of dirty data this only talks
 
04:04:17.199 --> 04:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
issue of dirty data this only talks
about

04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancies that's terminated medically
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about a chemical
 
04:04:23.600 --> 04:04:24.710 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about a chemical
termination

04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
termination
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
so also we're not including tremendo i'm
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
not advocating for this but if we have
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
terminal termination through a chemical
 
04:04:31.199 --> 04:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
terminal termination through a chemical
means

04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that data is not going to be in this
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
data stream
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
so right then and there we're going to
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
have dirty data because we're not
 
04:04:40.150 --> 04:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
capturing all the terminations we're
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
only capturing a subset of the total
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
so i would love to have a conversation
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
with representative stapleton and get
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
into more of this detail
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
because i think that's where the
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
conversation probably has to go
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the the question
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh chemical
 
04:04:57.600 --> 04:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
uh chemical
abortions

04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
should be attended by a physician
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a physician
 
04:05:02.560 --> 04:05:03.429 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a physician
and

04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
now maybe the law is going to change on
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
that we've already talked uh you know
 
04:05:07.520 --> 04:05:08.790 align:start position:0%
that we've already talked uh you know
telemed

04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
telemed
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
of prescriptions and abortions and so
 
04:05:10.960 --> 04:05:11.910 align:start position:0%
of prescriptions and abortions and so
forth

04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:05:11.920 --> 04:05:12.790 align:start position:0%
forth
well

04:05:12.790 --> 04:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's not the problem of data
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
statistics that's a problem of on the
 
04:05:17.760 --> 04:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
statistics that's a problem of on the
ground

04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
ground
 
04:05:18.880 --> 04:05:20.150 align:start position:0%

04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's a large
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
wheel of medical practice that goes into
 
04:05:49.429 --> 04:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
health care
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're not interested we're not on the
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
ground level of that detail
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
boil it down
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
confidential number non-identifying and
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
put that number against a
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
pregnancy termination
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
practice our procedure
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's it if
 
04:06:13.510 --> 04:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
if you if even if we added the 595
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
section for in a case of a warrant and
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
the reason we did that is because
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
since 1979 we've had little or no
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions or laws on the books
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
against abortion but now we've got the
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
24 week plus
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
abortion ban
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and everybody you know 90 of population
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
is going to obey the law and they're
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to be good citizens but you're
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
always going to have
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
the miscreants that are going to
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
compromise or
 
04:06:43.040 --> 04:06:45.189 align:start position:0%
compromise or
downright

04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
downright
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
invalidate or
 
04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
violate the law
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
so we have to have a penalty
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
and when you have a penalty and you have
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
to have a charge under our system to
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
prove it in court
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
there are such things as search warrants
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
and investigations and the process of
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
getting that information under your
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
medical record
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't come from the department because
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
they haven't got it
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
you go to the provider with a court
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
a search warrant that's authorized by a
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
court of law to address an indictment or
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
an investigation
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're not this is data over here this is
 
04:07:24.960 --> 04:07:26.309 align:start position:0%
we're not this is data over here this is

04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%

04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
count only you're talking about what's
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
over here for the application the ground
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
floor application of medical practice
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
and the confidentiality of records we're
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
you just basically brought up the issue
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
that i had
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
the information that's being held by the
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
department is all i'm impressed with the
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
steps you've taken
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
to protect the anonymity of both the
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
provider and the patient
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
however in the case that you said where
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
a case situation arose where court
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
issues a search warrant
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
who would that search warrant go to
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
would it go
 
04:08:24.630 --> 04:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
to the department you said it would have
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be delivered
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
to the provider but how does
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
how do they find out who the provider is
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
unless that information
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
is that a quirk in it that they could
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
identify the
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
provider by contacting you and then
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's a backdoor way of then getting to
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
who the patient is is
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
is that it going to be a problem
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh no it's
 
04:08:47.760 --> 04:08:49.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh no it's
not

04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
let's use a hypothetical if a search
 
04:08:51.520 --> 04:08:52.790 align:start position:0%
let's use a hypothetical if a search
warrant

04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
and a sheriff appears at the department
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a name on it it's
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
a provider
 
04:09:03.520 --> 04:09:04.950 align:start position:0%
a provider
maybe

04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
if the search warrant pertains to a
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
violation by a provider
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
i can't see how that would have a
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
patient name on it
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
what violation is the patient
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't make sense so
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing that
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
the department is going to have to say
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
is that we don't have the information
 
04:09:29.110 --> 04:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
you want
 
04:09:30.870 --> 04:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
you have to go back to the provider
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
because we're not uploading all of this
 
04:09:34.710 --> 04:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
patient data
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
and uh the including the detail
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
of how the procedure that was
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
statistically marked with a number
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
was performed
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
or what the gestational age of the
 
04:09:50.080 --> 04:09:51.269 align:start position:0%
or what the gestational age of the
patient

04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
or the patient's fetus was
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
he doesn't the department's not going to
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
have any of that information
 
04:09:58.080 --> 04:09:59.349 align:start position:0%
have any of that information
so

04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:59.359 --> 04:10:00.309 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
warrant really has to defer to the
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
provider who continues to have all of
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:10:06.960 --> 04:10:08.070 align:start position:0%
that information
but

04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
follow him thank you
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it also possible that
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
possibly the search warrant is against
 
04:10:16.000 --> 04:10:16.790 align:start position:0%
possibly the search warrant is against
the

04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:16.800 --> 04:10:17.910 align:start position:0%
the
patient

04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
who had the abortion after the 24-week
 
04:10:21.040 --> 04:10:22.830 align:start position:0%
who had the abortion after the 24-week
threshold

04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
04:10:22.840 --> 04:10:24.389 align:start position:0%
threshold
and

04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
but the only way to get to that would be
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
if they somehow identified the provider
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
who gave it
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
how do you handle a search warrant you
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
can't refuse
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
to cooperate
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
they just do not have any information
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
that they could get back to the
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
provider and who
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
you seem to indicate that they could get
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the provider by contacting you
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
but not to the patient but sometimes
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're possibly looking for the patient
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
is and i think the big concern everybody
 
04:10:58.870 --> 04:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
has if if the state is going to collect
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
this data and i've done something that i
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
find personally
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
not something i am proud of
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
or happy to have done
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
i don't want that information to ever be
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
made public is this a possible backdoor
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
way that it could come in
 
04:11:19.110 --> 04:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
and they could get that information
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
no and here's why um
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
let's go on that assumption that uh the
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
search warrant relates to the patient
 
04:11:28.159 --> 04:11:29.830 align:start position:0%
search warrant relates to the patient
and

04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:11:32.350 --> 04:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
here isn't written to
 
04:11:32.360 --> 04:11:33.990 align:start position:0%
here isn't written to
[Music]

04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
file against the patient but the
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
provider the provider is responsible for
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
establishing that gestational age
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
under the 24-week ban
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
and of course the patient has a
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to answer questions
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
honestly and in the interview process
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
and then of course you have the other
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
tools um and kind of
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
tools to make the determinations to
 
04:12:05.110 --> 04:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
so that i i don't foresee a problem
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
against the um
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
the patient as a matter of fact i think
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
i recall in some sectional law that uh
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.040 --> 04:12:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
prosecuted

04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
in that particular instance
 
04:12:20.399 --> 04:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
in that particular instance
so

04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the search warrant comes in into the
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they got a patient number
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
now remember the provider creates the
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
patient number
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't create the
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
patient number and they don't get an
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
uploaded data to identify that
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
so they have to say
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
to the officer you have to go to the
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
provider he can identify whether or not
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
this patient who you've just named
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that information here
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
and so you have to go to the provider
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
with with your warrant
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative i can understand how
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
gosh the colors i think it's red
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
conservative states
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
might not fret this so much
 
04:13:09.279 --> 04:13:10.149 align:start position:0%
might not fret this so much
but

04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
since it's 47 states that have data
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it interesting do you think
 
04:13:15.840 --> 04:13:17.670 align:start position:0%
isn't it interesting do you think
that

04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
blue states liberal states quote unquote
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
are already doing this kind of thing in
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
some form or another they've jumped
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
these hurdles that we're asking we're
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
not the trailblazers here do you find
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
that interesting that
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
blue states do this too
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i i think that does
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
testify to the
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
general nature
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the recognization of the value of
 
04:13:41.760 --> 04:13:42.870 align:start position:0%
and the recognization of the value of
having

04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:13:45.189 --> 04:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
health care statistics including this
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%

i'd like to just speak to the process of
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
am i not speaking close to i'm sorry
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna
 
04:14:02.790 --> 04:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
run through a process and you can tell
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
me if this is true or not if this how it
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
falls out is it true that is it true
 
04:14:07.439 --> 04:14:08.630 align:start position:0%
falls out is it true that is it true
that

04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:09.680 --> 04:14:11.189 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
if a warrant
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
if a warrant is issued
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
that there has to be a case
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
 
04:14:23.199 --> 04:14:24.630 align:start position:0%
a criminal case
filed

04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
filed
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
for a warrant to be issued
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case
 
04:14:29.279 --> 04:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case
or

04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
or civil case but
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know but there is a case that's been
 
04:14:34.080 --> 04:14:35.429 align:start position:0%
you know but there is a case that's been
filed

04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
filed
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
that case only gets
 
04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
filed against the provider
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
if someone believes they have
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
overstepped the bounds and gone past the
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
so that initial warrant they already
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
know who the provider is because someone
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
has come to them and said
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
this provider we're
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know almost positive 100 sure they
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
went past the 24 weeks
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
the warrants are are issued to obtain
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
actual factual information
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
which could either
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
prove the case true or it could provide
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
evidence that it wasn't true and
 
04:15:18.560 --> 04:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
evidence that it wasn't true and
actually

04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:15:21.429 --> 04:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
give the provider
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
a defensive out
 
04:15:25.189 --> 04:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question what you've
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
provided is the administration of
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
the legal process investigation and
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
court and
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
bringing charges
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with that
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
the only reason i mention 595 is because
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the case that information was needed
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
for this prosecution or this
 
04:15:47.920 --> 04:15:49.670 align:start position:0%
for this prosecution or this
investigation

04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
04:15:52.149 --> 04:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
authorized by a court under a search
 
04:15:52.159 --> 04:15:53.349 align:start position:0%
authorized by a court under a search
warrant

04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:15:53.359 --> 04:15:54.630 align:start position:0%
warrant
that

04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
the possibility is there
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
to obtain
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
information that might be available it's
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
not going to be available by the
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
department but it will be available
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
from the provider
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
in the detail that you've just described
 
04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
in the case that you've just
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
provided an example about
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
04:16:16.720 --> 04:16:20.149 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

04:16:20.149 --> 04:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
i have
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
extended travel here
 
04:16:30.870 --> 04:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
coming up and the next day
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
and um it was travel that was arranged
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
quite some time ago
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
there would be a conflict with uh having
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
further discussions in executive session
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
i would be available by
 
04:16:45.520 --> 04:16:47.670 align:start position:0%
i would be available by
email

04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
email
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to respond to questions but
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
not a physical presence to be
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
here for a dialogue or discussions or
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
even the exec
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
session because i understand you were
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
going to execute this bill sometime
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think so the 8th of february maybe
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's an early bill so yes we are yeah
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to be back until the
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
8th well
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
i understand that a conversation with
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative merchant he was
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
suggesting on some of the questions we
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
had discussed before we resumed the
 
04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
hearing we would like to put together a
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
group of
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
three or four or five people to
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
go into depth representative merchant
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%

i do have like a lot of us a zoom
 
04:17:41.110 --> 04:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
account and if you're traveling in some
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
place that you can get to a computer
 
04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
maybe one of the things we can do to try
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
to accommodate your schedule and
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
everyone else's schedule is to set up a
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:53.590 --> 04:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
possible before i forget are there a
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
couple of people on either side who
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
might like to join in with
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative merchant and the primary
 
04:17:59.840 --> 04:18:01.030 align:start position:0%
representative merchant and the primary
sponsor

04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%

representative
woods

04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
woods
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty good does that
 
04:18:15.429 --> 04:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
sound fair good
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay that'll be the group that'll be the
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
group that will work on this more fully
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
may i make one more point
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
04:18:27.990 --> 04:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
some testimony or some input from
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
especially from
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
the folks that administer
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire vital record
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
information network
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
because on my bill right the procedure
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
and the protocols are going to hearken
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
underneath that particular aspect of the
 
04:18:49.110 --> 04:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
department i'm going to ask you to talk
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
with john williams to get those names
 
04:18:51.920 --> 04:18:52.630 align:start position:0%
with john williams to get those names
and

04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%

04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
you oppose the bill you have written
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
testimony there's almost enough copies
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
to go around oh i have extra if there's
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
not enough okay because there's 21 of us
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is frank knack
 
04:20:01.110 --> 04:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
from the policy director with the aclu
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and we are here in
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
so as you know a lot of our testimony
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the stuff you'll read on
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
our fact sheet has already been covered
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i'll try and um uh not uh repeat what
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
has already been said just to point out
 
04:20:17.680 --> 04:20:18.630 align:start position:0%
has already been said just to point out
that

04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
the state's division of vital records i
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
think to back up
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
one of the early points brought up in
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
this debate
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
is you know what what we were talking
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
about here in terms of collecting data
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
around and i just want to make clear on
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
the record that we were talking about a
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
medical procedure that we're going to be
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
collecting data around and despite that
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
fact the uh
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state's division of vital records
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
collects information around birth
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
marriage civil unions divorce civil
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
union dissolution and birth certificates
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
it collects nothing around a medical
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
procedure and so i think it's important
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
to recognize that what we're doing here
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
is collecting information singling out
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
one type of medical procedure
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected medical
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
procedure for data collection and we do
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
so despite the fact that we've talked
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
about aggregate versus individualized
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
the way that this bill is drafted you're
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
collecting individualized data the forms
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
require individualized data
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i just did a quick google search
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
last year alone in the united states 40
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
over 40 million patient records were
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
subjected to a hack or or a breach data
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
breach and that is just in 2021 alone
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
and you'll note in my fact sheet um i
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
cite to a
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
page by the center for strategic
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
international studies uh kind of the the
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
international relations think tank in dc
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the point of doing that is they
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually looked at data breaches at a
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
nation-state level so countries that
 
04:21:41.359 --> 04:21:42.309 align:start position:0%
nation-state level so countries that
have

04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
extremely sophisticated cybersecurity
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
measures in place and the list goes on
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
and on and on about nation states and
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
major defense contractors whose data was
 
04:21:53.760 --> 04:21:55.349 align:start position:0%
major defense contractors whose data was
breached

04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
breached
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's important to
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that we were talking about
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
collecting individualized records
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
at the provider level that will then be
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
the aggregate to the state but that
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
individualized records are still there
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
with the patient number compared with
 
04:22:13.349 --> 04:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
with the with the procedure itself and
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
so all that is subjected and didn't
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
think back to 40 million records alone
 
04:22:19.110 --> 04:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:22:19.120 --> 04:22:20.710 align:start position:0%
last year
compromised

04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
compromised
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's also important to point out
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
that which hasn't been discussed thus
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
far today is the cost of what we're
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
talking about here you know
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 100 000 people
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
in our state who are living below the
 
04:22:33.990 --> 04:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
poverty line at or below the poverty
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
line and we're talking about spending
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
almost half a million dollars over the
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
next three fiscal years
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
implementing a data collection portal
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
that has from what we can tell from the
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
debate thus far
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
not a valid purpose because we are again
 
04:22:52.469 --> 04:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
singling out a single medical procedure
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
for a data collection in a portal that
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
is only collecting the non-medical
 
04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
procedure data
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
so the rest of my testimony i think has
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
already been covered
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
in detail so i'll leave it there thank
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
you chair has a question am i to
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
infer correctly
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
that therefore
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
the aclu would stand four square firm
 
04:23:13.680 --> 04:23:14.710 align:start position:0%
the aclu would stand four square firm
solid

04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
solid
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
with those citizens who do not want
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
their vaccine information sent anywhere
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a distinction
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
between individualized and aggregate
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
data collection our concern is that
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
under this bill it would be
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
individualized out of collection we have
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
no con we think data collection is
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
extremely important you know there's
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
some great legislation before this
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislated by this year around traffic
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
stops and race disparity that we think
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
is extremely important
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
our concern is not about that our
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
concern is about individualized records
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
that are at threat of being
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
disclosed and there there's no valid
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
purpose for doing so but aggregate we we
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
have no concern sir
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:24:05.670 --> 04:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
this was turning in the glue but i'll
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
say it again we have a strong
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
long tradition of privacy
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
so strong in so long
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
that we actually built it into our
 
04:24:14.720 --> 04:24:16.550 align:start position:0%
that we actually built it into our
constitution

04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
how many other states out there have put
 
04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
into their constitution to the degree we
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to protect our privacy
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
i cannot answer the specific question
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
sir i do know that the state has gone
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
above and beyond you know from uh you
 
04:24:31.990 --> 04:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
know privacy and liberty in terms of
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh surveillance technologies by law
 
04:24:33.520 --> 04:24:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh surveillance technologies by law
enforcement

04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
um surveillance technologies by the
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
private sector to ensure that that the
 
04:24:41.110 --> 04:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
individual rights of people
 
04:24:44.070 --> 04:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
and their privacy is protected could i
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
ask paul thank you
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
i guess the question to
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
aclu with the resources you have can
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
someone do a data search for me to find
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
out how many states out there have in
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
fact built into their constitution the
 
04:24:58.710 --> 04:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
degree that we have
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
to protect our privacy we've taken it
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
to that degree because it's that
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to look into that sir
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and this may be
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
another question that you can't answer
 
04:25:14.550 --> 04:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
but you seem to know a lot of things so
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'll ask it anyway um and maybe someone
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
who comes after you will
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
among the 47 states that um
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
cdc collects this kind of data from
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
are you do you know at what stage
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
of that collection
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
how do i put this at what stage is the
 
04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
information aggregated
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
for those other 47 states is it
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
aggregated by the providers or is it
 
04:25:45.199 --> 04:25:46.550 align:start position:0%
aggregated by the providers or is it
aggregated

04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
aggregated
 
04:25:46.560 --> 04:25:47.349 align:start position:0%
aggregated
by

04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
a department within the state government
 
04:25:51.670 --> 04:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
i will get back to you on that sir i do
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
not have the specific answer for you
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
here but i'll get it for you thank you
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
questions i also share your importance
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
on making sure that individuals aren't
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
identified by their data and thank you
 
04:26:10.870 --> 04:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
for paying close attention to that
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
when we look at how we'd implement this
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
obviously there'd have to be some link
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
for the providers so that when they
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
re-enter the system it's the same person
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
if this was implemented with a random id
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
generator in the system where if that
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
isn't even seen by the practice that's
 
04:26:30.149 --> 04:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
entering it and that happens quietly
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes so that there can be
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
no link would that address the concerns
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
about patient privacy while still
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
addressing potential health equity
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
issues if if this is disproportionately
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
affecting certain communities
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
i i think we are
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
unsure why the individual would have to
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
be connected at all and why we would
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
have to have that step why it wouldn't
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
be sufficient for the
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
provider to just provide quarterly
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
aggregate reports
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that don't
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily jeopardize the
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up when you're looking at this
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
data you wouldn't look you wouldn't
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily use an average age of 25 or
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
43 in order to get a good look at what's
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually happening so each of those
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual data points is useful so if
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
that information when it went in was
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
blind and simply had a entry number
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
unknown to the physician and unknown to
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
the entering person
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
i don't do you know how that would be
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
traced back to an individual patient
 
04:27:38.239 --> 04:27:39.189 align:start position:0%
traced back to an individual patient
um

04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
i am uh forever amazed at the advances
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
breach privacy and so i always urge
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
caution and ensure that we take the most
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
cautious steps possible and then minimal
 
04:27:57.670 --> 04:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
steps to that could
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
potentially breach privacy in the future
 
04:28:00.389 --> 04:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
if the concern is to gather data around
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know age race number of procedures
 
04:28:07.439 --> 04:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
you know age race number of procedures
etc

04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
etc
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
i think that i don't see a need to go
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
beyond filling out that basic
 
04:28:17.110 --> 04:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
information at the aggregate level at
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
that level
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
and why we would need to even
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
potentially put someone's privacy at
 
04:28:22.640 --> 04:28:23.830 align:start position:0%
potentially put someone's privacy at
risk

04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
risk
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
and again going back to the fact that we
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
are again talking about a medical
 
04:28:27.439 --> 04:28:28.630 align:start position:0%
are again talking about a medical
procedure

04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
being singled out for for data
 
04:28:31.680 --> 04:28:32.790 align:start position:0%
being singled out for for data
collection

04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
collection
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.239 --> 04:28:40.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
um no
 
04:28:42.399 --> 04:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
um no
delemus

04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
delemus
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me no
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
hello hello okay thank you mr chairman
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just
 
04:29:01.590 --> 04:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any of this kind of
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
stuff so are are providers offices
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
also vulnerable to data breaches
 
04:29:07.760 --> 04:29:09.670 align:start position:0%
also vulnerable to data breaches
individually

04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
individually
 
04:29:09.680 --> 04:29:10.550 align:start position:0%
individually
okay

04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am i mean anything that is uh
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
accessible via the internet is at risk
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
of data breach and i think that's part
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
of our concern but the way this bill is
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
drafted is even if it is at the provider
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
level their their systems are vulnerable
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
to attack
 
04:29:26.239 --> 04:29:27.269 align:start position:0%
to attack
follow-up

04:29:27.269 --> 04:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:29.359 --> 04:29:30.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:32.309 --> 04:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
do are you aware if there's anything
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
being done to protect those data in
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
those in those offices i i don't know
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
we have strong uh laws that that uh
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
dictate how
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
health records are are to be kept in
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh but again nothing is perfect in
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
systems you know even you know the
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
united states government you know the

04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know that have uh some of the most
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive data you know that one can
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
think of have have have breaches um you
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
know nothing is perfect no system is
 
04:30:04.870 --> 04:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
perfect and so i think again that that
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
that is why i urge caution at the
 
04:30:08.950 --> 04:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
collection of individualized data
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
particularly without any type of
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
sufficient need and so i would urge the
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
think think carefully about the need to
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
collect that information versus the
 
04:30:18.800 --> 04:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
collect that information versus the
aggregate

04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
04:30:22.950 --> 04:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else thank you so much
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%

of the the details of some of the
 
04:30:59.110 --> 04:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
concerns we have but i'm just going to
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
leave a very brief um background since
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'd worked with this committee on a key
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill starting back in 2014 which was
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1502 this bill was put in
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
interim study and worked on like you
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe uh in terms of going
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
through the mechanics of this particular
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
proposal uh for those members who came
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
aboard with us in 2016 they may recall
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
one of the first bills they took on was
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
hb 629 in 2016.
 
04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
that was a bill that came out of that
 
04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
interim study committee that had been
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
worked on um in in pretty great detail
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was passed by the house but
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
tabled by the senate and there have been
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
a couple iterations of bills including
 
04:31:41.670 --> 04:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
the one that represents stapleton who is
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
a delight in joint although he's not
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
here for benefit of the comments uh to
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
work with when he was on the committee
 
04:31:47.279 --> 04:31:48.309 align:start position:0%
work with when he was on the committee
um

04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
identifying those bills as we've made
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
our progress so some of the questions
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
when you ask questions of the department
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
why is it so
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
historically i'll be relying back on
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
we've gone down those conversations
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
before i know that representative leon
 
04:32:04.950 --> 04:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
you had brought up regarding additional
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
data points such as race race and
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
ethnicity and there are when you look at
 
04:32:09.199 --> 04:32:09.990 align:start position:0%
ethnicity and there are when you look at
our

04:32:09.990 --> 04:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
companion states like the state of
 
04:32:13.110 --> 04:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
vermont those were data elements that
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
initially then bureau chief tricia tilly
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
now director of public health tricia
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
tilly working along with myself worked
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
very strongly on to make sure that the
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
data that we'd be
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
receiving would be helpful and
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
meaningful however as a compromise
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
working over many many hours it was
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
decided that the group of data points
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's identified in this legislation is
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what was distilled upon at
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day so i'm not
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
here to reopen those conversations but
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
historically to explain why
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
they're not included currently in the
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
i would also like to say to represent
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
merchant who i do not see in the room
 
04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
on the constitutional issue that the
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution 11 that passed in
 
04:32:53.359 --> 04:32:55.510 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution 11 that passed in
2019

04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
or 18 that eventually became part 2b of
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's constitution around
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
privacy actually occurred after
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
the earlier work that was done on the
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
prior bill so i'm not prepared to
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
responding on how that may relate on a
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional level
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
to the current legislation before you
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
because quite honestly those issues
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
weren't even uh ripe at the time because
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
of the fact that there was no provision
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
under the state constitution to do that
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
particular analysis uh so with that said
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
probably uh um notwithstanding some of
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
the clinical pieces from a data point
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
and statistics that dr trell is going to
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
get into i'm going to mention the one
 
04:33:37.269 --> 04:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
thing that you hear me state on about
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
every other bill if you do want us to do
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
this you do have to fund it and that
 
04:33:43.029 --> 04:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
would be our respectful request of the
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee the department did identify
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
the need for a position to do this work
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
in the bill it has a fairly modest sum
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
of a little over a hundred thousand
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
dollars respectively for each respective
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year including benefits it
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
does not include
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
certain systems related changes that
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
we'd be required to make as a
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
requirement to the statute we do adhere
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
very strongly to safeguarding
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
information and protecting that
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
information and so
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
that piece of the work would need to be
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
done there's also a contracting piece
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
that we would have to also be involved
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
with so this bill currently does not
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
provide an appropriation for the
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
department to do that um we don't we
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
also did not have the benefit of the
 
04:34:24.959 --> 04:34:26.150 align:start position:0%
also did not have the benefit of the
draft

04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
draft
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that was proposed to the
 
04:34:28.320 --> 04:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
amendment that was proposed to the
committee

04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
and at least nothing physically in front
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
of us to be able to respond to but i do
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
know from what i heard from the
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
testimony we are concerned and i see
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
our one of our members of our agency uh
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
chawe chirala who is with us in the
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
audience who um all who brought to our
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
attention that we specifically do not
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
want to look into amending rsa 126
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
regarding health statistics
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
uh which is we which be a new wrinkle
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's not identified in the current
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislation you may recall and and
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
represent mcmahon was a co-sponsor uh
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
for a bill that we worked very
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
diligently to clean up our health
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
statistics statute working with this
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
body working with the department of
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
justice and others back in 2019 and
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 1-1-1 so we would like to
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
keep that in place without looking for
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
further amendments to that section of
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
the bill as a technical uh challenge in
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill you'll note that there's some
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
in turn there's at least one internal
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
consistency issue that i'd like to bring
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the committee
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
knowing that this is going to be worked
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
on so we'll keep our commentary brief
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
that on page 2 starting on lines 22
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
through lines 27 it starts off with the
 
04:35:35.600 --> 04:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
through lines 27 it starts off with the
initial

04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
initial
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement from the
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
department on january 1st and then
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see it has to be posted on our
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
website no later than june 30 of that
 
04:35:45.119 --> 04:35:45.910 align:start position:0%
website no later than june 30 of that
year

04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
correspondingly there's the same
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
provision that deals with the annual
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement on the same date
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
of the bills starting on line page three
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
line ten
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm focusing specifically on
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
the first new paragraph roman
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
3a not the section b
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
below but you'll see that there are two
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
specific sets of data one that the bill
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill as it originally was
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
worked on by this committee over
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
more than half a decade a worth of work
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
is reflected in the laundry list of the
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
data that we're going to report on the
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
upper sections this has us reporting on
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
the current procedural terminology
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as cpt codes and also
 
04:36:31.750 --> 04:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
the s codes that you'll see
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
as well it's
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
at a minimum these two sections will
 
04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
need to be harmonized because you have
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
two different reports essentially that
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
the department's doing so they really
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
need to be brought together as a single
 
04:36:44.709 --> 04:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
report if the legislature directs us
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
doing this also it's interesting that
 
04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
you may recall for those of you who are
 
04:36:49.279 --> 04:36:50.150 align:start position:0%
you may recall for those of you who are
here

04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
on one of the prior very recent prior
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
iterations of the bill that this
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
committee did um
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
i believe brought forth some type of an
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
amendment that dealt with the cpt code
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
so this is not the first time that we've
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
seen this i'm looking around for
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge for those who
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
were on the committee in the last couple
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
of years that we expressed concerns
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
regarding it one from a drafting
 
04:37:11.910 --> 04:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint that it's unusual putting cpt
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
codes in statute and so it might even be
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
better to more appropriately identify
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
what information the that the committee
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
would be interested in the legislature
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
would be interested in us collecting uh
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
i will say dr trella is kind enough she
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
does have the secret dakota ring of cpt
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
codes if you're interested ever in
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
finding out what these mean and we can
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
certainly provide it to you after after
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
04:37:37.349 --> 04:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
um so the other last comment i'd like to
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
make before turning it over to dr trala
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
is we work very collaboratively with the
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
department or rather i was going to say
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
the department of state but the
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office and
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
regularly they could not be here with
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
you today because a large share of the
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be entertained by
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
this committee deal with the
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
safeguarding and the collection of data
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
the vitals records otherwise known as
 
04:38:00.310 --> 04:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire vital records
 
04:38:02.470 --> 04:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
information network is housed not with
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
services which is slight anomaly because
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
in most states i think pretty much all
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
states that vital record is housed with
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
health division department
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
in our state it's housed with the
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office again we're
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
not here to try to suggest taking on
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
more work than we need to do but it is
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're very limited in
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
terms of thank you for not putting that
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendment forward uh that we're very
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
limited in terms of what we can respond
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
to relative to uh safeguarding of their
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
information we can talk to you about our
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
safeguarding and i talked to dr sorella
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
anticipating the question to her
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge we've not had a data breach as
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
to our system since her tenure here in
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
the department so dr charles turn it
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
over to you thank you
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
i think john covered most of my points
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's the reason i keep john on the
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
side so
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving us this opportunity
 
04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
to speak and one of our top priorities
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
for the department is
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
is the health of mothers and babies with
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
our objective is to promote healthy
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
pregnancy early childhood and as well as
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
looking at how do we reduce unintended
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
pregnancies especially in teens because
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's our one of our priority areas but
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
what we understand is we if we want to
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
understand how the pregnancy is we need
 
04:39:17.189 --> 04:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
to understand all the outcomes not just
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
one place one one kind of area and we
 
04:39:22.709 --> 04:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
get we want to use this information to
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
want to see what kind of targeted
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
prevention both the primary prevention
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
public health prevention as well as
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
clinical services that we need to
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
provide this should include the family
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
planning as well as any kind of
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care and this should
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
be for all new hampshire residents not
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
for certain groups not for some some
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
people but all new hampshire residents
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
given this context we have some really
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about the current uh
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill as it is this ties back to some of
 
04:39:51.510 --> 04:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
the data collection pieces some of the
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
privacy protections and also the current
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
alignment that we have with our current
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
rsa statutes as well as our rules in the
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
our administrative roles so has john
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out we have some issues about
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
data collection piece uh validation we
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
can do any kind of validations preparing
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
and some of the most important pieces
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
some of the providing some of the
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
education to health care providers how
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
would that tie back to some of that work
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
and we do not have an appropriation this
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be an unfunded work for us and we
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
do not have a capacity to do that work
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
and there is currently an rsa statute
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
and rules that actually provide a
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
structure on how we share data with our
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
division of vital records just to
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
remember department is very different
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
from the division of vital records so
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
how this data is shared is very clear so
 
04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
and it's also limited currently for our
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
birth death data marriage and divorce
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
and few other things and we do not this
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
would be a new data system that would
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
have to be come under that and has john
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
pointed out there are two different
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
systems this legislation is talking
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
about or this bill is talking about one
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
is the new data system that has to be
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
created and the other is the existing
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
hospital discharge data which is very
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
different so we have to be very clear
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
about what exactly these two are as john
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
pointed out marry these two systems so
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
that we have one clarity on what those
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
things are
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
this also means that we would have to
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
change some of our existing rsa status
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
again rule changes
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
and most important for us
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
the high priority for us is the safety
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
and privacy of our healthcare providers
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
as well as our patients and we are
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
worried and we are very concerned that
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
this whatever however the legislation is
 
04:41:35.350 --> 04:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
written it will still evidently impact
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
the privacy of our patients and our
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers
 
04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
and as um representative leon mentioned
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
we are very interested in uh other other
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
additional variables like race and
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
ethnicity as well as other social
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
determinants of health as well as the
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality because as i said we
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
are not just looking at one outcome we
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
are looking at understanding the
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and health
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and the final and the most important
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
concern we have is around how does it
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
align with the current or recently
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
passed fetal uh the fetal life
 
04:42:08.948 --> 04:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
protection act because in that there is
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
a specific section talking about
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
reporting from the providers and how
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
that ties back to that and how would
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
also that tie back to some of the
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties tied in that rsa
 
04:42:19.440 --> 04:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties tied in that rsa
statute

04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
so in closing one of the things that i
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
do want to have
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
put very be very clear is
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
we do not have a capacity or funding to
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
do this work
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
and there are high high
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh issues or multiple concerns around
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the people who will be
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
getting this information who will be
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
providing us this information we have to
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
think about that so we want you we want
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
to bring this concerns to the to this
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee to understand those these are
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
the things that we need to think about
 
04:42:51.990 --> 04:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for giving us this
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity and we are here to answer
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:43:00.150 --> 04:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
being back in front of the committee i
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
always love talking data with you
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
my question is to the idea of
 
04:43:06.000 --> 04:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
my question is to the idea of
aggregating

04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
aggregating
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
putting aside all the other questions
 
04:43:09.360 --> 04:43:10.628 align:start position:0%
putting aside all the other questions
looking

04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
if we aggregate the data at the provider
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
level where there's a very there's a
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
limited number of providers who provide
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
this service in new hampshire if we have
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
those aggregated information
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
versus having it
 
04:43:25.510 --> 04:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
with each of those entries how does that
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
impact data analysis when you're looking
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
at 24 or 36 or 12 different aggregated
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
data points versus however many
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
individual data points we would have
 
04:43:37.040 --> 04:43:37.990 align:start position:0%
individual data points we would have
um

04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:40.470 --> 04:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
i i will try to answer that but for this
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
question i might have to turn back to
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
our our other bureau chief
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
miss charway chavla she is the data
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
expert not me
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
but uh just to give you the background
 
04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
we already have a hospital discharge
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
data that comes to us that could be
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
another system that could do that but
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
creating a new data system with that
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of an aggregate level we don't have
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
a system to take that into account some
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
and uh mr williams if we could have a
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
cosign on the pink card
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please yes so to receive
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
aggregated data that means that we have
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
to fully trust what data is submitted to
 
04:44:23.750 --> 04:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
us so that means that the state or the
 
04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
agency may not have a way to validate
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
the data since it's aggregate level and
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
then if we are not going to be able to
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
identify the provider then we are not
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
validate as well which provider has
 
04:44:38.948 --> 04:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
submitted data to us so we need to fully
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
trust the data that is submitted to us
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
if it's in an aggregate format
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
this is the chair and as the husband of
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
a primary care physician i am very
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
appreciative of your desiring to
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
uphold their privacy
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
but i couldn't help thinking at
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
dr sai that
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
many of the questions you've raised
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
about what about this and the concern of
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
that and hipaa and all the other things
 
04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
obviously haven't they not
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
must have been addressed by 47 states
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
who are doing this in some way or other
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure there's you don't have to
 
04:45:17.670 --> 04:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel you can find out what
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing in all kinds of different
 
04:45:21.750 --> 04:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
states and that should really inform
 
04:45:24.150 --> 04:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
those questions which were appropriate
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
very appropriate questions that you
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
raised do you think
 
04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think they i understand where the
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
question is coming from representative
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
pearson chair sir uh but the question is
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
also like 47 states have done doesn't
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
mean that they have done it in a vacuum
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
they have done it with their with the
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
process in place and
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
here that the bill which is asking us to
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
do is two different things there is a
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
totally different electronic system that
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
is being created under a different
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
department which we do not have any any
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
kind of control so that's a question for
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
us the other piece is yes some of these
 
04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
things are important but the privacy and
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
those protections are in the different
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
places each state have a different kind
 
04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
of take on it so those are some of the
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
things that has to be worked out in our
 
04:46:09.920 --> 04:46:10.948 align:start position:0%
things that has to be worked out in our
state

04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:15.750 --> 04:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and i think you have touched
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
on this but i want to be sure am i
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
correct in understanding that
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
with respect to data collection the
 
04:46:29.670 --> 04:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
first problem is that
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
the bill as drafted setting aside the
 
04:46:32.080 --> 04:46:33.670 align:start position:0%
the bill as drafted setting aside the
amendment

04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:46:36.070 --> 04:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
requires the use of the new hampshire
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
vital records information network which
 
04:46:40.150 --> 04:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
does not collect
 
04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
medical data it collects
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
birth death
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
divorce statistics
 
04:46:47.520 --> 04:46:49.030 align:start position:0%
divorce statistics
and

04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
is not under the
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
not under the control of the department
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes that's accurate okay
 
04:46:55.440 --> 04:46:56.708 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes that's accurate okay
so

04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
so am i correct and thinking the bill
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
would have to be revised to provide
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
for that issue that's number one
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up i would
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
i would depend on the committee what the
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
decision is being made yeah fair enough
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
yes if
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
we are collecting this data in the
 
04:47:18.878 --> 04:47:21.350 align:start position:0%
we are collecting this data in the
department

04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
do you not need a whole new data
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
collection system and was the whole new
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
data collection system part of the
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
process when the cost of implementation
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
was figured out
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
for this bill no because this bill was
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
very clear that the system would be
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
sitting under that vital records so we
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
kind of looked at what was our cost and
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
what would be responsibility from our
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
end we haven't put the cost around if
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
the data system sits under us
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
and and the final yes again
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you know and you may not know um
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
does the
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
system in place at vital records have
 
04:48:06.788 --> 04:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to generate
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
the kind of super secret numbers unknown
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the provider an unknown to the health
 
04:48:12.000 --> 04:48:13.430 align:start position:0%
to the provider an unknown to the health
department

04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:48:13.440 --> 04:48:14.230 align:start position:0%
department
that

04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
representative leon was talking about or
 
04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
would that also require a system we
 
04:48:21.830 --> 04:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't have in place at the moment
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for the vital
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
records than us i i don't know all their
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
data systems per se and what kind of
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes they can do
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
so that would be a question to for the
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and could i have
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
one one
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
one more um
 
04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
and isn't it true that the purpose of
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
the vital records department
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
is to collect records that are actually
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
intended to be public
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
at least under appropriate circumstances
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to collecting information
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
like people's birth and death records
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh as opposed to information
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
like medical records which is supposed
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
to be completely and utterly private
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
i can speak as a medical provider and a
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
primary care provider yes that's the
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
intention that all our medical records
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be pri
 
04:49:19.030 --> 04:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
be protected um again the intent of the
 
04:49:21.270 --> 04:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
vital records for birth
 
04:49:23.350 --> 04:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
death and others i think again they are
 
04:49:25.030 --> 04:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
the ones who can comment on that and
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
what kind of protections they have in
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
place that's fair enough thank you
 
04:49:29.280 --> 04:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
place that's fair enough thank you
representative

04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:32.550 --> 04:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
04:49:34.550 --> 04:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
question i just want to check you both
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
discussed the question of validation of
 
04:49:38.550 --> 04:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
the data that that would be difficult to
 
04:49:38.560 --> 04:49:39.430 align:start position:0%
the data that that would be difficult to
do

04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
is the concern there just sloppy
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
reporting or false reporting
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
or both
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
i would say both because given some of
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
the things that any kind of data system
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
takes time for both the education of the
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
providers as well as getting an accurate
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
data to reflect on it and understand
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
like where the gaps are and how do we
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
educate our providers on getting the
 
04:50:04.550 --> 04:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
right information so our concern with
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
that kind of things is both those two
 
04:50:06.480 --> 04:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
that kind of things is both those two
issues

04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.868 --> 04:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson
 
04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question and
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be
 
04:50:24.550 --> 04:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
educate representative folsom
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
how do you go about
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
collecting the data say on how many
 
04:50:32.070 --> 04:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
people have had heart attacks in the
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
state or how many people have had
 
04:50:38.540 --> 04:50:38.550 align:start position:0%
uterine cancer or breast cancer or
 
04:50:38.550 --> 04:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
uterine cancer or breast cancer or
[Music]

04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
a variety of different health
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
issues that you can go online and read
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
all kinds of statistics about
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
how do you collect that and keep it
 
04:50:51.600 --> 04:50:52.550 align:start position:0%
how do you collect that and keep it
private

04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
i um thank you for the question um it's
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
an education for all of us we learn how
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
to go so um
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
you had a very good question about
 
04:51:01.760 --> 04:51:02.948 align:start position:0%
you had a very good question about
cancer

04:51:02.948 --> 04:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have a state cancer registry which
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
collects the incidence-based data so
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
whenever any new hampshire residents get
 
04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer the hospitals are
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
places where they get diagnosed we get a
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
report so we follow that and we
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
understand where their diagnosis
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
happened what is the kind of diagnosis
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
and what kind of cancer and all that so
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
cancer uh registry and that's an rsa
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
statute that covers that
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
for the chronic diseases we do not have
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
a registry but we use our hospital
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
discharge data to understand what's the
 
04:51:37.750 --> 04:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
prevalence meaning how many people have
 
04:51:39.670 --> 04:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
that at that point of time
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
we also have what you call has behavior
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
risk factor surveillance system which is
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
can you repeat that please
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
behavior risk factor surveillance system
 
04:51:51.430 --> 04:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's called in short brfss so these
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
these are also
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
these are national level and these are
 
04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
telephone based uh surveys and these are
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
called uh people
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
people get called and they provide like
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
they are asked list of questions do you
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
have diabetes and all that and these are
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
all again people give permission for
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
those questions to be asked and to be
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
surveyed basically
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
so again that's a that's again a
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
prevalent system basically saying in
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
this in the sample for new hampshire
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is the number of people who got who
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
have a diabetes or who have hypertension
 
04:52:23.830 --> 04:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
i mean high blood pressure so those are
 
04:52:26.550 --> 04:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things we do not have we do
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
not create registries for the sake of
 
04:52:30.868 --> 04:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
registries we kind of create them for
 
04:52:32.788 --> 04:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
following some clear
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
understanding some high risk issues like
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
cancer because we know that requires
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
understanding we need to know what kind
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
of treatment are working what kind of
 
04:52:44.550 --> 04:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
things are working and we try to
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
understand what the lifetime risk
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
factors are so we create those systems
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
04:52:51.520 --> 04:52:52.628 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
follow-up

04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:52:57.510 --> 04:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
um if uh if a system existed that um
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
was reporting
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
abortions and also reported
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
the types of um
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
contraceptive methods that were used
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
would it be able to then provide some
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
information on better preventing
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
unwanted pregnancies therefore
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
avoiding a medical
 
04:53:20.480 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
avoiding a medical
procedure

04:53:21.120 --> 04:53:21.130 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:53:21.130 --> 04:53:23.270 align:start position:0%
procedure
[Music]

04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes yeah i would say yes but again
 
04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's a creating a system means
 
04:53:27.440 --> 04:53:29.350 align:start position:0%
that's a creating a system means
basically

04:53:29.350 --> 04:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
you asked about cancer registry
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
currently the cancer registry system
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
costs around a million dollars
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
we get federal funding to support that
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
one we get a small percentage from
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
general funds but very small but we are
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
dependent on federal funds to run that
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
kind of that systems so again there's a
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
cost involved when you're looking at
 
04:53:48.400 --> 04:53:50.070 align:start position:0%
cost involved when you're looking at
this

04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
data for the collection of data is good
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
but it also needs some it needs a
 
04:53:56.948 --> 04:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
purpose and what are we using that for
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
where are we using this information and
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
how it could be utilized for other
 
04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
things we are always public health
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
people population health people we love
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
data so it's all about looking at how we
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
can avoid where are the gaps what kind
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
of social determinants of health are
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
impacting people so that's important for
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
us but we also understand like you know
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
where where is our written on investment
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
where do we need to put our resources to
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
get the better results on you know not
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
only looking at outcomes but also where
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
is the health gaps are so that's an
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
you may not
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
the question i have is that
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
i've become aware that something from
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire in the
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department called all all
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
payers claims data
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
and my understanding in that data there
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
is the cpt codes
 
04:54:55.750 --> 04:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here so are we
 
04:54:58.150 --> 04:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
reinventing a wheel
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
the all-player schemes data does sit on
 
04:55:01.750 --> 04:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health insurance
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
department we do have
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
again for access purpose we have
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
specific protections in place
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at john because again that's
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
a different department and they would
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
have a better
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
answer for that question yes we do have
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
arrangement through our division for
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid services as it relates to what
 
04:55:23.430 --> 04:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
they call chis the comprehensive health
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
information system which is are
 
04:55:26.550 --> 04:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
receiving that information from the
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
department of insurance um we really
 
04:55:31.190 --> 04:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
would have to put our hat on and really
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
think through how that might be utilized
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of the underlying bill
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh i this is a first occasion over five
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
plus years of thinking we've chatted
 
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
about everything about the subject
 
04:55:44.550 --> 04:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
matter uh so i can certainly um have it
 
04:55:47.190 --> 04:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
looked into by attorney rob berry and
 
04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
also don landry who's in the audience to
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
take that back to see
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
what if anything could be done around
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
that but i do want to say that that
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
claims data would be limited to a
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
certain population not a statewide
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
population would be my understanding and
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
looking back at dawn for a little nod to
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
say that would be correct in terms of
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
chiz would only be medicaid
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's a yes that i see
 
04:56:07.280 --> 04:56:10.708 align:start position:0%
that's a yes that i see
follow-up

04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
but as i understand this are we talking
 
04:56:14.550 --> 04:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
about the data sent from the insurance
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
department over to dhhs which is a
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
subset of the large database
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
with the larger database in fact have a
 
04:56:20.958 --> 04:56:22.788 align:start position:0%
with the larger database in fact have a
richer

04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
richer
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
data points that we could pull across
 
04:56:28.628 --> 04:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
instead of just looking at medicaid
 
04:56:30.390 --> 04:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
and respectfully mr chair that would be
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
a question for the very knowledgeable
 
04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
tyler brannan from the new hampshire
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
insurance department he would know the
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.628 --> 04:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
taking this question which is
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually going to be directed at john
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
mr williams counselor
 
04:56:58.390 --> 04:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:00.550 --> 04:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a couple of references to
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
funding and
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
and this is just my naivety about um how
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
these bills work
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh there is a fiscal note attached to
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
this uh with 139 300
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
in 23 20 and then another
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
similar number 24
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
and about that same number and 25
 
04:57:21.920 --> 04:57:22.788 align:start position:0%
and about that same number and 25
is

04:57:22.788 --> 04:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
that just not enough to cover what you
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
had mentioned earlier a wonderful
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you so much for for
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
offering that representative king
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
that is a confusion that executive
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
branch agencies have as much as the
 
04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislative branch that just because of
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill has a fiscal note identifying the
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
cost that does not fund the program
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
there actually has to be language
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
contained in the bill itself to provide
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
an appropriation of an appropriate
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
amount you'll also see under the
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
estimates and those were just for the
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
staffing costs salaries and benefits not
 
04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
to include other costs that are would be
 
04:58:00.230 --> 04:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
related to this but you'll see that
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
underneath there it said the another
 
04:58:01.920 --> 04:58:03.110 align:start position:0%
underneath there it said the another
agency

04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
did not have an opportunity to provide
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
well they did have an opportunity they
 
04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
just well you can read it
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
and so we can't defend that because we
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
submitted our information
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
but if you'd like to see a snapshot of
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
what it might look like i'd already
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of prior bills that
 
04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
were out there and they did identify in
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
their fiscal note sheet it was
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
definitely in the six figure range the
 
04:58:28.150 --> 04:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
lower six-figure range between 100 and
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
but if you were to take a look at uh hb
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
629 from
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
2016 or hb 471 from 2017 again hb 2 629
 
04:58:46.470 --> 04:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
hb 629 from 2016 and hb 471 from 2017
 
04:58:47.910 --> 04:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
that will give you at least the cost
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
estimates based in that magic moment in
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
time and maybe you can extrapolate from
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
that what those costs may be but knowing
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state are
 
04:58:57.270 --> 04:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful people and they respond to
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
particularly committee chairs who ask
 
04:59:00.550 --> 04:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
for information i assume you'll be
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
getting an updated information on those
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
systems costs thank you represent king
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking forward to their
 
04:59:12.638 --> 04:59:15.510 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking forward to their
response

04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
the chair calls jason hennessy new
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my name is jason
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
hennessey i'm the president of new
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire right to life which is the
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
largest pro-life organization in new
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire we represent thousands of
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
pro-life citizens
 
04:59:42.550 --> 04:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
i also have a phd in computational
 
04:59:45.030 --> 04:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
sciences and statistics and i'm also a
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
resident of amherst new hampshire
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
so we're here to enthusiastically
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
support hb 1654.
 
04:59:51.360 --> 04:59:52.868 align:start position:0%
support hb 1654.
so

04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire takes an extreme position
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
on this we are one of only three states
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
that does not collect abortion
 
04:59:59.280 --> 05:00:01.030 align:start position:0%
that does not collect abortion
statistics

05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because you can go to
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
the state website and find statistics on
 
05:00:06.868 --> 05:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
all sorts of stuff you can find it on
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
heart attacks asthma
 
05:00:09.360 --> 05:00:11.350 align:start position:0%
heart attacks asthma
stds

05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
stds
 
05:00:11.360 --> 05:00:12.550 align:start position:0%

05:00:12.550 --> 05:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
copd
 
05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
but you can't find it on abortion
 
05:00:14.798 --> 05:00:15.830 align:start position:0%
but you can't find it on abortion
so

05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now the way the system works is
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we have to depend on voluntary
 
05:00:19.280 --> 05:00:20.470 align:start position:0%
that we have to depend on voluntary
disclosure

05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
05:00:20.480 --> 05:00:21.270 align:start position:0%
disclosure
uh

05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:22.948 --> 05:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
and then and and it's only they're only
 
05:00:24.550 --> 05:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
incentivized to do that when it suits
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
their needs and i'll give you an example
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
um a couple weeks ago in here in the uh
 
05:00:31.350 --> 05:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
actually in the state house
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
over there at the hearing for sb 399
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the commit the senate judiciary
 
05:00:40.390 --> 05:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee asked the ob gyn chair of
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock how many
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
to quantify the number of late term
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
abortions and the answer and i quote uh
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
it would appear that this is a small
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
number was the first quote the second
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
one was i would project it is not many
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
women at all who seek those services
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
and so as far as the legislature goes
 
05:01:00.550 --> 05:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
how are you supposed to make decisions
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the data you know is a
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
small number to dartmouth 5 is it 50 is
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
it 500 it's a 5000
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know they see a lot of patients
 
05:01:08.878 --> 05:01:09.590 align:start position:0%
i don't know they see a lot of patients
so

05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
um the fact is that you as legislators
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't have access to this data to make
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
decisions and you guys have been hearing
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
all sorts of bills this year
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
on on late term abortion and other
 
05:01:18.638 --> 05:01:19.750 align:start position:0%
on on late term abortion and other
things

05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
the second thing is
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
from the science perspective so
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh in my in my in my past as a graduate
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
student i was the informatics
 
05:01:29.590 --> 05:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator for a large federally funded
 
05:01:29.600 --> 05:01:30.868 align:start position:0%
coordinator for a large federally funded
study

05:01:30.868 --> 05:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
we had to comply with federal laws so
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know what
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
informatics coordinator is
 
05:01:38.550 --> 05:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's not very common so i don't know why
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
you would
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's the person kind of in charge of
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
designing the system to keep track of
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
all the data and so i was in charge of
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
designing the system and and complying
 
05:01:49.110 --> 05:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
with federal laws and in terms of
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
protecting it
 
05:01:50.480 --> 05:01:52.310 align:start position:0%
protecting it
um

05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:01:55.830 --> 05:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
something so something i want to bring
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
your attention to is that this data is
 
05:01:59.190 --> 05:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:01:59.200 --> 05:02:00.470 align:start position:0%
would be
absolutely

05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
vital for doing for doing science
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
um covering abortion so so depending on
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
which end of the
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
pro-life or pro-choice spectrum you're
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
on if you believe if you are pro-choice
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
you probably think that abortion is
 
05:02:13.120 --> 05:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
you probably think that abortion is
healthcare

05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's no reason not to
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
collect this data because we collect
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
data on all sorts of things that are
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
part of healthcare
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
and if you're like me and you're
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
believing you believe in the personhood
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the unborn
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
these records are
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
similar to like birth or death
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
certificates and so regardless of which
 
05:02:31.270 --> 05:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum you're on
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to think there's a there's
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
a really good reason to believe in this
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
um so the way that the way that this
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
works right now prevents scientists and
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists from hosting a ton of
 
05:02:43.110 --> 05:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
studies and and smart scientists come up
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
with all sorts of questions
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we can't think of um
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
and and they discover all sorts of good
 
05:02:50.550 --> 05:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
things uh just a couple that i could
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
think off up the top of my head was
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the incidence of teen
 
05:02:54.080 --> 05:02:55.350 align:start position:0%
looking at the incidence of teen
pregnancy

05:02:55.350 --> 05:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
what percent of pregnancies are aborted
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh are there certain geographies in new
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are affected more than
 
05:03:00.798 --> 05:03:01.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are affected more than
others

05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:03:01.920 --> 05:03:02.788 align:start position:0%
others
or

05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:03:04.470 --> 05:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
even things like are there are there hot
 
05:03:07.030 --> 05:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
spots where there are fetal anomalies
 
05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they get aborted and we we have no
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
idea that it's going on because there's
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
no sort of central record that we can
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
use to analyze this data so there could
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
be there could be environmental effects
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
another question is are we in line with
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
05:03:21.760 --> 05:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
so

05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
you'd have to take my word for it
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
the pro-choice guttmacher institute in
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
its 2015 uh
 
05:03:30.550 --> 05:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
statement on
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
titled abortion reporting promoting
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
public health not politics states three
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
states do not report any basic data on
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
abortion incidents and patient
 
05:03:41.110 --> 05:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
characteristics to the us cdc
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh it then say says these gaps in state
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
abortion surveillance have hampered
 
05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
efforts by the cdc to compile complete
 
05:03:48.550 --> 05:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
abortion statistics at the national
 
05:03:48.560 --> 05:03:50.868 align:start position:0%
abortion statistics at the national
level

05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:03:50.878 --> 05:03:52.470 align:start position:0%
level
um

05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:54.788 --> 05:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
and then they they go on to say to
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
address these challenges
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
abortion surveillance systems should be
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
strengthened as needed in states where
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
they are not where they're already in
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
place and created in states where they
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
are not so that's not we pro-lifers
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
saying that that's the pro-choice
 
05:04:09.510 --> 05:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
research folks
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of privacy so another hat that
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
i've had in my in my
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
varied career is i'm a published
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
computer security and privacy researcher
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and advocate and so and that's
 
05:04:22.868 --> 05:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
actually a big part of the reason i love
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire is because uh
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
you guys do things like
 
05:04:29.910 --> 05:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh opt us out of real id and stuff
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
so um in line with best practices having
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
a three-tier system of decreasing
 
05:04:37.270 --> 05:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge is exactly what this bill does
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
so this sets up three three tiers so you
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
have the provider who has all the
 
05:04:40.560 --> 05:04:41.910 align:start position:0%
have the provider who has all the
information

05:04:41.910 --> 05:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:04:44.550 --> 05:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
you have the the state which has
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh de-identified information and then
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then you have the the the public
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
information and at each level you're
 
05:04:52.470 --> 05:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
losing information
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
and that is the best practice is having
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
only the providers can actually decode
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
who these
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh who these folks are and that's
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
exactly the way we want it
 
05:05:04.708 --> 05:05:04.718 align:start position:0%
um the the system produces little risk
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
as a state only receives de-identified
 
05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
data to di to
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
um to re-identify it
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
you would then have to go back to the
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
provider who has all the information
 
05:05:15.120 --> 05:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
provider who has all the information
anyway

05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't so this bill does not
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
create risk
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
where it wasn't before if somebody can
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
break in
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
to the providers they can get all the
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
information including you know social
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
security numbers or health insurance
 
05:05:28.878 --> 05:05:30.628 align:start position:0%
security numbers or health insurance
whatever

05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't have enough
 
05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
information to reconstruct this stuff
 
05:05:37.350 --> 05:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
so that that's a really important point
 
05:05:37.360 --> 05:05:39.270 align:start position:0%
so that that's a really important point
um

05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
um so to be honest actually the the
 
05:05:46.708 --> 05:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
biggest risk to the to the to
 
05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
de-identifying these people is not
 
05:05:49.990 --> 05:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
through the system
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's probably more likely through their
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
phones which are tracking their location
 
05:05:54.550 --> 05:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
all the time and by the way if that's
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
something that you would like to not see
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
um with
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
but there's also health insurance which
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
has uh has their own records there's
 
05:06:05.920 --> 05:06:07.190 align:start position:0%
has uh has their own records there's
medicaid

05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the provider's own health systems
 
05:06:10.230 --> 05:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
and these are all these are also all
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
tracking these things so
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
the state as i mentioned
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
only has de-identified data
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
it is legislatively enforced for privacy
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
at the state and federal level people
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
who break in there's big consequences
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
so uh another another question i've
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
heard is on uh
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
do we need an identifier well without it
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
without an individual identifier we
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
would have we wouldn't be able to answer
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions such as are abortions focused
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
within a certain population
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
or you know is it spread out evenly are
 
05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
there few people doing a lot or are
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
there a lot of people having a few um
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
these are all good scientific questions
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
um another one i'd like to address would
 
05:06:54.958 --> 05:06:55.910 align:start position:0%
um another one i'd like to address would
be

05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
why have they uh why not have the
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
providers aggregate their data
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
and as a statistician i can tell you
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
that this severely limits the tools we
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
can use so there's all sorts of
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
predictive modeling
 
05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
and analysis you can do
 
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the data that if you have if you have
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
individualized data that you cannot do
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
if you just have
 
05:07:17.110 --> 05:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
you know a number that's aggregated
 
05:07:17.120 --> 05:07:19.030 align:start position:0%
you know a number that's aggregated
before

05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and i'd be happy to talk more about
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
that if you have questions
 
05:07:22.000 --> 05:07:23.910 align:start position:0%
that if you have questions
um

05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
oh in terms of search warrants i heard
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
about about the potential for going back
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
to the providers so i would draw your
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
which is the third page
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:46.070 --> 05:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh line three it says this data shall
 
05:07:50.550 --> 05:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
only be released to the department as
 
05:07:50.560 --> 05:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
only be released to the department as
authorized

05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh by this section
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then at the very end it says the uh
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
the confidential number or any other
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
obtained under this paragraph shall be
 
05:08:03.430 --> 05:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
for statistical purposes only
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore be exempt from disclosure
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
under rsa 91a so
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but it would be my
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
belief that this protects the data which
 
05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh this would protect the data from
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
being served with a search warrant but
 
05:08:18.430 --> 05:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
again not a lawyer
 
05:08:18.440 --> 05:08:23.990 align:start position:0%
again not a lawyer

05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.830 --> 05:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
so another thing is that somebody said
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
oh well you can just go back to the
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
provider so nothing in this bill
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
requires that providers persist their
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
medical records
 
05:08:33.670 --> 05:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
if they want to preserve privacy they
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
can limit the records like many
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
companies do so a lot of companies limit
 
05:08:38.868 --> 05:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
it to like three years or something for
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
records retention
 
05:08:41.280 --> 05:08:42.868 align:start position:0%
records retention
um

05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
and addressing representative merchant
 
05:08:45.120 --> 05:08:45.910 align:start position:0%
and addressing representative merchant
uh

05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
in part one paragraph g this this bill
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.600 --> 05:08:55.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:08:55.350 --> 05:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:08:58.390 --> 05:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
and that's my testimony so we we support
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:09:08.958 --> 05:09:10.310 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
when i look at the bill now if i go back
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to really collect the
 
05:09:19.440 --> 05:09:20.470 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to really collect the
data

05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
and the aggregate
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm losing
 
05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
an understanding of why we have to have
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
the health care provider identified
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
number two
 
05:09:30.948 --> 05:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
on line number 24
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
once you link a patient confidential id
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
code you're creating a patient
 
05:09:34.320 --> 05:09:35.830 align:start position:0%
code you're creating a patient
identifier

05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
identifier
 
05:09:39.270 --> 05:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that in my opinion is a
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
reaching if you will back to the
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
constitution of our country is that we
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
have now a patient identifier so
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
would you as a organization still be
 
05:09:49.110 --> 05:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
able to use the data without having the
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
provider and the patient identifier in
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
there so so thank you for your question
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative merchant um so
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
right now we have no data any data would
 
05:09:58.868 --> 05:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
be better than no data
 
05:09:58.878 --> 05:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
be better than no data
um

05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:00.000 --> 05:10:01.350 align:start position:0%
um
however

05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess as a
 
05:10:05.830 --> 05:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
as a privacy science privacy researcher
 
05:10:05.840 --> 05:10:06.708 align:start position:0%
as a privacy science privacy researcher
and

05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
statistician um
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
to to re-identify that data from that
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
identifier you would have to have access
 
05:10:16.550 --> 05:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
to the provider anyway
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
and they already have access to
 
05:10:17.680 --> 05:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
and they already have access to
everything

05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:21.440 --> 05:10:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:10:24.150 --> 05:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you if
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
they can follow up
 
05:10:30.788 --> 05:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
in lieu of having those identifiers what
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
i've heard some other data elements
 
05:10:34.830 --> 05:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
which seem to be more important to
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
long-term longitudinal data such as
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
possibly their age certain other things
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
that are in there maybe the status of
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
economics or whatever maybe demographic
 
05:10:46.080 --> 05:10:47.190 align:start position:0%
economics or whatever maybe demographic
data

05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
would that be as important and could
 
05:10:50.708 --> 05:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
that suffice on what you're trying to
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
get to as far as trying to
 
05:10:54.310 --> 05:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
long-term trying to identify
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
trends that we have within it trying to
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
identify the population that we're
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
target versus trying to get down to the
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
patient code of the provider code
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
um so could you clarify when you say
 
05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
patient code or provider do you mean the
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
cpt codes are you talking about
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
going back to page one
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
on line
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
13 and line 24
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
if those were deleted
 
05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
and we still maintained
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
some of the other demographic code would
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
help us long term
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on within our
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
state to help us
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
from a medical point of view target
 
05:11:32.310 --> 05:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe certain targets of population with
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
education whatever it may be to again
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
help them with
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
either preventing pregnancy or dealing
 
05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
with a pregnancy if you will
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:11:41.520 --> 05:11:42.868 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:42.878 --> 05:11:43.590 align:start position:0%
representative
so

05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:43.600 --> 05:11:44.788 align:start position:0%
so
again

05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
any data is better than no data
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
so if we can get any data that's better
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
but but there are many more powerful
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
tools you can use in the statistical
 
05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question from mr
 
05:12:00.958 --> 05:12:02.708 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question from mr
hennessey

05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
hennessey
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
question uh the testimony now has opened
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
up some new
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
new areas of investigation so the the
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
one that we heard about the the chis
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
they actually already have a way to
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
de-identify and have an encrypted
 
05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
patient keys
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
so would you would you
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe or would you
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
think that taking a system that's
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
already in place within the state of new
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire would be the right way to
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
follow this and do you know if
 
05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
any abortion statistics are collected
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
with that or if they are somehow
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
excluded from the all payers claims
 
05:12:40.958 --> 05:12:42.628 align:start position:0%
excluded from the all payers claims
database

05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
database
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative leon um
 
05:12:46.480 --> 05:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
representative leon um
so

05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
you asked a couple of questions in there
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to keep them straight up
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
could you i guess first one is if
 
05:12:54.230 --> 05:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's already a way to have an
 
05:12:57.190 --> 05:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
encrypted double encrypted key patient
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
identifier so it needs to be broken
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
twice would that be a protection of
 
05:13:05.110 --> 05:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:07.350 --> 05:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
um i would have to see the system
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
because cryptography
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
is can be complicated so i don't know if
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
that i would be able to say answer that
 
05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
right here okay thank you and then the
 
05:13:16.470 --> 05:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
other one was if you were aware whether
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
or not the all payers claims database
 
05:13:19.830 --> 05:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to capture all
 
05:13:22.708 --> 05:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
procedures is capturing these procedures
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i believe that would be a question for
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
the agency but that is a great question
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
and and if it's possible to piggyback on
 
05:13:30.868 --> 05:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
something else that's already working
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:43.920 --> 05:13:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
i've asked representative merchant to
 
05:13:47.760 --> 05:13:50.788 align:start position:0%
i've asked representative merchant to
chair

05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%

other on the 8th of february that's
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
our day so uh get back to me with things

if you wish by then
 
05:14:13.910 --> 05:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative stapleton if you would
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
also get the data from

district 22.
 
05:15:47.350 --> 05:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
i come before you
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
with a bill 1536 fn and in full
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure i am also
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
presenting an amendment for your
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
consideration though i will address the
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill first
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
05:16:00.628 --> 05:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
um what this bill currently does is
 
05:16:01.830 --> 05:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
directs the department of health and
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
human services to submit a state
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
amendment um to expand postpartum
 
05:16:06.160 --> 05:16:07.510 align:start position:0%
amendment um to expand postpartum
coverage

05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
05:16:09.510 --> 05:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
under medicaid
 
05:16:11.430 --> 05:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
what this seeks to do
 
05:16:11.440 --> 05:16:12.868 align:start position:0%
what this seeks to do
is

05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:16:12.878 --> 05:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
is
that

05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
currently the state provides medicaid
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
coverage to pregnant women with incomes
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
up to 196 percent of the federal
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
poverty level for 60 days postpartum and
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
it would then extend it from 60 days to
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
a full calendar year
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
for 12 excuse me for 12 months
 
05:16:30.718 --> 05:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
for 12 excuse me for 12 months
additionally

05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
what this then does
 
05:16:33.840 --> 05:16:36.550 align:start position:0%
what this then does
is

05:16:36.550 --> 05:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:38.830 --> 05:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
effectively provides 10 additional
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
months worth of postpartum coverage
 
05:16:43.590 --> 05:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that i feel strongly
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
that this would be
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
a benefit to
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
women in
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is that the bill will also
 
05:16:53.110 --> 05:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
then provide access to other types of
 
05:16:54.708 --> 05:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
care such as
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
anything from
 
05:16:56.718 --> 05:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
anything from
for

05:16:57.510 --> 05:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
those additional 10 months lactation
 
05:17:00.000 --> 05:17:01.510 align:start position:0%
those additional 10 months lactation
um

05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
urology like if if a woman is having
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
incontinence issues postpartum or a
 
05:17:08.788 --> 05:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
mental health care needs around those
 
05:17:08.798 --> 05:17:10.628 align:start position:0%
mental health care needs around those
issues

05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions about
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
the actual bill as well as the potential
 
05:17:18.150 --> 05:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
amendment for your consideration and i
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is the first time to be fair and
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
that i've ever come before the committee
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
with an amendment in hand so i don't
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
know how to proceed with that
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
we'll all learn together may i discuss
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
it and absolutely i don't see why not i
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
mean that helps us understand what
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
with me
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay and so the other the amendment
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
before you which would be 20 22 0 3 9 1
 
05:17:44.470 --> 05:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
h for consideration
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
simply creates some parity um
 
05:17:48.788 --> 05:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
with another
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
bill proceeding in another chamber and
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
the date on line 11 from october
 
05:18:01.440 --> 05:18:02.310 align:start position:0%
the date on line 11 from october
1st

05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
1st
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
2022 to august 15th of 2022 as some
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders had indicated that
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
potentially it could be implemented
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
and then um on line 23 it adds um an
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
appropriation there for it um and seeks
 
05:18:18.958 --> 05:18:20.230 align:start position:0%
appropriation there for it um and seeks
to

05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you
 
05:19:04.310 --> 05:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility for medicaid
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
for pregnancy and

for pregnancy and
postpartum

05:19:11.670 --> 05:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
postpartum
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
um what are the requirements for that
 
05:19:13.760 --> 05:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
um what are the requirements for that
eligibility

05:19:15.990 --> 05:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
05:19:16.000 --> 05:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
eligibility
so

05:19:17.110 --> 05:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
currently um the way eligibility i
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
believe is um
 
05:19:24.628 --> 05:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
determined is that it will cover
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
currently up to 130
 
05:19:29.110 --> 05:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty level is
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
that answering your question
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:33.440 --> 05:19:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:19:36.550 --> 05:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
am i on
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
um i just wondered what percentage of
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
new mothers in new hampshire
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
do suffer from postpartum depression
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
that is a fantastic question that i
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:19:53.110 --> 05:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
i don't have um a full answer to at the
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
ready but i'm happy to dig further into
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i should note that um for the record
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
like in addition to postpartum
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
depression there are many other
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
psychological postpartum issues that
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
surround a woman
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
um and post-pregnancy and oftentimes
 
05:20:08.230 --> 05:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
60 days is just not sufficient to in
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
initially diagnose the situation and
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
then continue to treat the individual
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's postpartum depression or
 
05:20:18.628 --> 05:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
postpartum anxiety or a litany of other
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
things that might be associated with a
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
new mom
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that really we're seeking
 
05:20:25.270 --> 05:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
to try and create the best opportunity
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
for healthy moms and babies okay thank
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative kenner thank you very
 
05:20:36.548 --> 05:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question would you
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
anticipate that this will provide
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
a significant improvement in both
 
05:20:44.470 --> 05:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
maternal health and child health in the
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
state if we can actually get them health
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
care yes i do
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
answering this question
 
05:20:56.320 --> 05:20:59.190 align:start position:0%
answering this question
um

05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:01.830 --> 05:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
someone was to give birth
 
05:21:07.430 --> 05:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they qualified for medicaid by
 
05:21:09.990 --> 05:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
virtue of their
 
05:21:10.000 --> 05:21:11.910 align:start position:0%
virtue of their
income

05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:21:11.920 --> 05:21:12.788 align:start position:0%
income
that

05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
come 60 days after delivering a child
 
05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
they would likely still qualify for
 
05:21:19.120 --> 05:21:21.030 align:start position:0%
they would likely still qualify for
medicaid

05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:21:21.040 --> 05:21:23.350 align:start position:0%
medicaid
so

05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that someone's financial
 
05:21:26.788 --> 05:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
situation didn't change and they
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
what would this bill actually do would
 
05:21:35.110 --> 05:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
it change what
 
05:21:36.788 --> 05:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
what services were covered under
 
05:21:36.798 --> 05:21:37.830 align:start position:0%
what services were covered under
medicaid

05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question i i to be fair i
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
think that there might be somebody
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
behind me who might be better qualified
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
to to should they seek to do that
 
05:21:46.480 --> 05:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
to to should they seek to do that
ex

05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
ex
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
explain that in more detail
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yeah just
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'll wait but i'm just trying to get at
 
05:21:54.480 --> 05:21:55.430 align:start position:0%
i'll wait but i'm just trying to get at
whether

05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
this creates a continuation of medicaid
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
itself or just the continuation of
 
05:22:01.200 --> 05:22:02.230 align:start position:0%
itself or just the continuation of
certain

05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:22:04.150 --> 05:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
services covered by medicaid going
 
05:22:04.160 --> 05:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
services covered by medicaid going
forward

05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:22:16.548 --> 05:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you is
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
could you correct me if this is wrong
 
05:22:21.750 --> 05:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay as i'm understanding it if the
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
mother is already covered by medicaid
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
she would not need this bill she would
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
already be covered for pregnancy
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
and for giving birth and for
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
continuation of care
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
is it correct that this bill is to cover
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
people who do not qualify for medicaid
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
but children do so as a pregnant mom
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
she would be covered
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
and up to 60 days
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
later this would extend that even though
 
05:22:52.400 --> 05:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
later this would extend that even though
she

05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
she
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
children get
 
05:22:56.310 --> 05:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
medic children
 
05:22:58.868 --> 05:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
children are covered by medicaid
 
05:23:01.350 --> 05:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't understand it would be nice
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
to understand what the dollar amounts of
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
income are that put these categories
 
05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
sure i will allow folks to but my
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is to expand that safety
 
05:23:13.670 --> 05:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
net to for individuals
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
pregnant individuals postpartum so that
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
that is looking at
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
there is an increase in the percentage
 
05:23:21.040 --> 05:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
there is an increase in the percentage
of

05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:28.390 --> 05:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
those between 138 and 196
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level would be captured
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
moment so that's what it's looking to
 
05:23:35.920 --> 05:23:42.230 align:start position:0%
moment so that's what it's looking to
address

05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.990 --> 05:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
could you define that again does this
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
mean this bill would say that they would
 
05:23:45.920 --> 05:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
mean this bill would say that they would
qualify

05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
05:23:47.120 --> 05:23:48.150 align:start position:0%
qualify
for

05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
this service
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
even if they their income was too high
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
ordinarily to qualify for the mom to be
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
covered by medicaid this would allow her
 
05:23:58.638 --> 05:23:59.670 align:start position:0%
covered by medicaid this would allow her
income

05:23:59.670 --> 05:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:24:00.788 --> 05:24:00.798 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh go up to 196
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
whereas to be on medicaid it would have
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
under 138 this would be between 138 and
 
05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
presenting this
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
my question about this is it looks like
 
05:24:25.750 --> 05:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's a 68-day window so somebody who
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
remains on medicaid remains on medicaid
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
but adding 12 months afterwards does
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
this mean that in that 12 months it's
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
income blind and so somebody who has
 
05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
really periodic large income
 
05:24:39.680 --> 05:24:40.548 align:start position:0%
really periodic large income
things

05:24:40.548 --> 05:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:24:41.830 --> 05:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
can say
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
have a baby and then the following year
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
sell something of tremendous value make
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars or a million
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
dollars while on medicaid
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
and then if they have a baby again the
 
05:24:55.110 --> 05:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
following year be able to turn and roll
 
05:24:55.120 --> 05:24:55.910 align:start position:0%
following year be able to turn and roll
this

05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
with making a very high income yet
 
05:25:00.310 --> 05:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
getting state taxpayer funded health
 
05:25:03.030 --> 05:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
care i am not sure i'm understanding
 
05:25:04.150 --> 05:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
your crush but thank you for your
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear it's it's
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
10 months of service not an additional
 
05:25:12.000 --> 05:25:13.590 align:start position:0%
10 months of service not an additional
year

05:25:13.590 --> 05:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
so there's 10 more months because
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
there's already 60 days covered and so
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
it's looking to extend it for 10 more
 
05:25:18.638 --> 05:25:19.910 align:start position:0%
it's looking to extend it for 10 more
months

05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
i would also then
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
defer your very specific question to
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
that scenario perhaps to somebody in the
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
department because i'm not entirely
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure what you're referencing
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative we do have a pink card
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
filled out by three people probably for
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
economic reasons and they're all from
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sir and we're they're all
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
from the dhhs and
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
if you like um we can defer those
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
technical questions to them and happily
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
do that i thought you might
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
and are there any non-technical
 
05:25:53.910 --> 05:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative about
 
05:25:57.190 --> 05:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
now we invite the triumvirate

now we invite the triumvirate

05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman my name is
 
05:26:36.070 --> 05:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
rob berry i'm the general counsel to the
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
division of medicaid and with me i have
 
05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
cycle i'm from the bureau of public
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
population health from the division of
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
don landry the division of medicaid
 
05:26:50.000 --> 05:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
don landry the division of medicaid
services

05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:26:54.868 --> 05:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
so i'll be general because the two
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
smarter people are next to me
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
with this information but
 
05:27:00.788 --> 05:27:00.798 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the department is
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill we believe it's
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
an important piece of legislation toward
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
providing a better continuum of care for
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
postpartum women
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
and with that we're happy to take any
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have
 
05:27:17.350 --> 05:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think there were some questions about
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
the um criteria the eligibility criteria
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
for medicaid but my my question
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
specifically is
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
assuming that a person gives birth goes
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
through the first two months their
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
income hasn't changed um they haven't
 
05:27:41.430 --> 05:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
been given a gift of millions of dollars
 
05:27:41.440 --> 05:27:42.788 align:start position:0%
been given a gift of millions of dollars
or

05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
discovered something at a yard sale
 
05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
that was worth a lot of money but
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
assuming their income hasn't changed and
 
05:27:52.390 --> 05:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
they stay on medicaid does this
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
does this
 
05:27:54.000 --> 05:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
does this
bill

05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
change the services that are covered or
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't change the services all
 
05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
pregnant women get
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
all services that are available under
 
05:28:11.190 --> 05:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
the medicaid state plan we just we don't
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:17.190 --> 05:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
what currently happens is that when a
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman gives birth they have
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
coverage through the 60-day postpartum
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
and because the income does go up to 196
 
05:28:28.390 --> 05:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
percent what we do is we evaluate them
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
for any other medicaid coverage
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
so in most cases some of them will go to
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
granite advantage which covers up to 138
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
percent but those women who would lose
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
coverage from 138 to 196
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
they would either
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
terminate medicaid or they would get
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
referred to the marketplace and this
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
would maintain the woman's
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
coverage in the medicaid coverage
 
05:28:57.190 --> 05:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility category
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
for those 138 to 196 for 12 months
 
05:29:04.470 --> 05:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
so follow up follow up so i think i
 
05:29:04.480 --> 05:29:06.788 align:start position:0%
so follow up follow up so i think i
understand

05:29:06.788 --> 05:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
am i correct in in
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that you're saying that
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
for someone who's pregnant
 
05:29:13.840 --> 05:29:14.628 align:start position:0%
for someone who's pregnant
they

05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:29:17.670 --> 05:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
the criteria for eligibility is at 138
 
05:29:21.190 --> 05:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
of um federal poverty level
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the pregnant women category it's 196
 
05:29:23.920 --> 05:29:25.590 align:start position:0%
for the pregnant women category it's 196
percent

05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:29:25.600 --> 05:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
percent
okay

05:29:26.470 --> 05:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
so but it goes
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
after that two-month period it goes
 
05:29:34.470 --> 05:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
down to 138
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
correct so they may they potentially
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
could lose medicaid they could but
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
but under this bill they would not for
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
12 months correct regardless of change
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
in income
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:29:51.830 --> 05:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
and his microphone
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:30:00.230 --> 05:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be possible for that same
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
woman who
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
was previously at 196 and that was
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
dropped at 130. couldn't she go into the
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
in and out medicaid program for that
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
10-month period she could and and um
 
05:30:13.680 --> 05:30:14.788 align:start position:0%
10-month period she could and and um
this

05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
option would require us to continue her
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
coverage through in and out without
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
having her to meet that spend down
 
05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:28.948 --> 05:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:30:35.430 --> 05:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not too familiar with the federal
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
poverty standards and lines and so forth
 
05:30:40.470 --> 05:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
but help me understand is the 138 196
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
based upon one individual or based upon
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
the family four can you help me
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
understand because what i'm trying to
 
05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
get to is that once the child is born
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know you have a family of at least
 
05:30:48.480 --> 05:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
you know you have a family of at least
two

05:30:49.350 --> 05:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:30:50.948 --> 05:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
so will that change the percentage of
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
the income requirements it may not
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
change the percentage but that will that
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
change the income requirements for the
 
05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
mother and the child
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes um so currently the way we look at a
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman's eligibility for
 
05:31:06.150 --> 05:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid i'll just use the example of a
 
05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
single mom who's pregnant we already
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
count her as a household or two because
 
05:31:13.030 --> 05:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
we count the mother herself and the
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
because i wasn't very clear with the
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
previous example let me give a more
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
concrete one let's say you're laid off
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
from your job on wall street when you're
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
three months pregnant assume i was a
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
single mom at that point
 
05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
i then at four months postpartum went
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
back to work on wall street so that
 
05:31:41.670 --> 05:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
would be over the federal poverty limit
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
would that would i still have been would
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
i be eligible if that was today or only
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
for those people who stay below that 196
 
05:31:48.638 --> 05:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
for those people who stay below that 196
percent

05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:31:51.600 --> 05:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
percent
um

05:31:53.190 --> 05:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:55.510 --> 05:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
can you say that again okay i'm sorry
 
05:31:55.520 --> 05:31:56.948 align:start position:0%
can you say that again okay i'm sorry
income

05:31:56.948 --> 05:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
at first here
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
laid off income here from until four
 
05:32:01.760 --> 05:32:02.830 align:start position:0%
laid off income here from until four
months

05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
postpartum four months postpartum income
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
here again
 
05:32:10.230 --> 05:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
if i was qualifying for the medicaid
 
05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
based on my during pregnancy and six and
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
post 60 months
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
is it
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
totally income blind and that in those
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
additional 10 months or does you have to
 
05:32:24.470 --> 05:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
stay within that 196 percent no it it
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
maintains regardless of your change in
 
05:32:26.480 --> 05:32:27.750 align:start position:0%
maintains regardless of your change in
income

05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:32:29.510 --> 05:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
that would have been a benefit for me
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you this um hypothetical assumes
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
people working on wall street make above
 
05:32:38.230 --> 05:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.548 --> 05:32:44.558 align:start position:0%
so he went with another question
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
get numbers again those percentages
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you uh got laid off
 
05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
then your whatever money that you
 
05:33:00.390 --> 05:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
got because you were laid off
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh that would have to have fit under the
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
poverty level i'm assuming one of these
 
05:33:05.440 --> 05:33:06.948 align:start position:0%
poverty level i'm assuming one of these
levels

05:33:06.948 --> 05:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
levels
 
05:33:09.750 --> 05:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
and if if you're laid off and you're
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
making this but now you're making much
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
lower because you have some kind of
 
05:33:15.910 --> 05:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
benefits because you get laid off you
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
196 percent of poverty so if you're
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:33:31.510 --> 05:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying that even if
 
05:33:33.350 --> 05:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
in that 10 months
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
if we if we pass this and that becomes
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
law in those 10 months following or the
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
say the year
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
following the birth
 
05:33:43.110 --> 05:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
they would still qualify even if their
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
income went up that that yes and that's
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
currently true today in that
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
from so from a time a woman applies and
 
05:33:52.628 --> 05:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
she's eligible under the pregnant woman
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
category or any other category of
 
05:33:56.310 --> 05:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
medicaid just by virtue of being
 
05:33:56.320 --> 05:33:57.270 align:start position:0%
medicaid just by virtue of being
pregnant

05:33:57.270 --> 05:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
we cannot terminate her coverage based
 
05:34:00.798 --> 05:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
we cannot terminate her coverage based
on

05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:34:03.990 --> 05:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
an increase in her income for example it
 
05:34:06.788 --> 05:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
would only be terminated in the event
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
she passes away is no longer a resident
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
or request coverage herself be
 
05:34:12.480 --> 05:34:14.470 align:start position:0%
or request coverage herself be
terminated

05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
05:34:16.708 --> 05:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
so really it
 
05:34:18.788 --> 05:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
it's maintaining the same eligibility
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
criteria right now it's just extending
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
the postpartum period from 60 days to 12
 
05:34:23.600 --> 05:34:26.628 align:start position:0%
the postpartum period from 60 days to 12
months

05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
i thought i understood this so now i'm
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the bouncing ball i
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
guess and not doing too good of a job
 
05:34:38.240 --> 05:34:39.510 align:start position:0%
guess and not doing too good of a job
here

05:34:39.510 --> 05:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
so when the mother
 
05:34:43.990 --> 05:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
is pregnant she's counted as two
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
and it's 196.
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
but once the mother delivers she now has
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
the mother and the child
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
whatever reason magically drops down to
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
138 even though there was two to begin
 
05:34:54.878 --> 05:34:56.390 align:start position:0%
138 even though there was two to begin
with

05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:34:57.910 --> 05:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
no she's
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
we look at her
 
05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
up to 196
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the pregnant woman's category because
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
at the end of the um
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
60-day postpartum she's no longer
 
05:35:11.110 --> 05:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
pregnant we have to evaluate her for
 
05:35:13.990 --> 05:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
another medicaid eligibility category
 
05:35:15.830 --> 05:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the highest the next highest
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
category would be
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage program which only
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
goes up to 138.
 
05:35:24.390 --> 05:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's getting a little clearer
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
the 196
 
05:35:33.430 --> 05:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's because she's pregnant
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay who determines the 196 versus the
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
138 is that the federal government is
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's the state government where does
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
that number come from
 
05:35:41.990 --> 05:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
that does come from the federal
 
05:35:44.310 --> 05:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
government and the 196 is in our state
 
05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
plan and we do have a state statute that
 
05:35:51.510 --> 05:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
sets the minimum at 185. okay thank you
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
i did see your hand and i nodded
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative connerk thank you very
 
05:35:56.708 --> 05:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
much um
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
just to clarify is the reason why
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
we would not is the reason why it just
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
simply once you qualify you stay that
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
way for that extra 10 months is to avoid
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
05:36:13.510 --> 05:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
of monthly income verification the
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
burden both to the patient but also the
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
burden of the department of needing to
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
determine eligibility every single month
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that those costs might possibly
 
05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
outweigh any potential cost of somebody
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
who has a sudden windfall and change in
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
their income
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
is that part of the reason why we don't
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
worry about doing it month by month we
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
the requirement to maintain the
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
continuous eligibility really is a
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
federal requirement
 
05:36:40.240 --> 05:36:41.430 align:start position:0%
federal requirement
currently

05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
extending it to 12 months isn't is an
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
option so i'm not really sure that it
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with
 
05:36:48.400 --> 05:36:49.990 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with
um

05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know the administrative burden on
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility and that it is
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
that 60 months is a current
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
federal requirement
 
05:37:01.350 --> 05:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up you know i mean i appreciate
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
that but is even at the federal level is
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
that simply because if we impose burdens
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
of determining eligibility every month
 
05:37:09.910 --> 05:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
we begin to end up spending a lot of
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
money on administrative costs rather
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
than on patient care costs which would
 
05:37:14.878 --> 05:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
than on patient care costs which would
be

05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
you know because you have to balance
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
that i think we're getting it are people
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to be getting something for
 
05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
nothing but we also are going to lose a
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
lot if we do it month every month having
 
05:37:28.390 --> 05:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:30.868 --> 05:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
generally eligibility is set for one
 
05:37:33.070 --> 05:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
month read um i'm sorry one year
 
05:37:35.190 --> 05:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
redeterminations anyway it's annual
 
05:37:37.510 --> 05:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
unless there's a change of circumstances
 
05:37:39.670 --> 05:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're required to report
 
05:37:41.110 --> 05:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then we would have to redetermine
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
eligibility but generally it is an
 
05:37:47.430 --> 05:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you i'm
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing a clarifying question so if a
 
05:37:55.830 --> 05:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
non-pregnant woman um
 
05:37:59.430 --> 05:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
gets a large job in a large promotion an
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
increase she'd be required to share that
 
05:38:04.150 --> 05:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
information and if she didn't would she
 
05:38:09.030 --> 05:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
be in violation of the stat of a law
 
05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
sorry that's the change in status i'm
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if the person's
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
required to self-report when there's a
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
significant change in income
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes they are required to report with
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
intent any change that would impact
 
05:38:23.510 --> 05:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for medicaid within 10
 
05:38:23.520 --> 05:38:24.390 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for medicaid within 10
days

05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
10 days or 10 business days
 
05:38:28.628 --> 05:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
i would have to double check the statute
 
05:38:30.150 --> 05:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
but i can get i'll double check the
 
05:38:32.150 --> 05:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
statute but i think it is within 10 days
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the change
 
05:38:33.600 --> 05:38:34.830 align:start position:0%
of the change
thank

05:38:34.830 --> 05:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:38:37.590 --> 05:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
you representative gay
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you would that be
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
10 days from getting a job or 10 days of
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
05:38:43.120 --> 05:38:46.788 align:start position:0%
getting a
paycheck

05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to double check the statute
 
05:38:50.310 --> 05:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
because it is specific in the state law
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
of when they have to report it i don't
 
05:38:53.990 --> 05:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
think it has to do with when they
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
receive a paycheck but we would ask them
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
to provide their pay status you know
 
05:39:02.470 --> 05:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
at that point just to determine if they
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
still qualify for medicaid under any
 
05:39:05.280 --> 05:39:08.150 align:start position:0%
still qualify for medicaid under any
program

05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the department
 
05:39:14.548 --> 05:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much

to you today brief
 
05:39:45.190 --> 05:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to start off
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
by saying that
 
05:39:46.718 --> 05:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
by saying that
the

05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the american heart
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
association i'm really happy to be able
 
05:39:52.390 --> 05:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be here today to
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
comment in support of this legislation
 
05:39:56.878 --> 05:39:57.830 align:start position:0%
comment in support of this legislation
so

05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
the american heart association recently
 
05:40:01.990 --> 05:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
put out a scientific statement on
 
05:40:05.510 --> 05:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
maternal health um so this this all this
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
policy is really very timely um with uh
 
05:40:10.628 --> 05:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
with our support of this in a general
 
05:40:13.110 --> 05:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
way across the country um but i want to
 
05:40:14.470 --> 05:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
start by saying that the heart disease
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
and stroke are the leading causes of
 
05:40:18.628 --> 05:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
death in new mothers in the united
 
05:40:21.510 --> 05:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
states um accounting for over one-third
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
of all maternal deaths um that are
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancy related um cardiovascular
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
disease-related deaths are occur of the
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
highest between 42 days and 365 days
 
05:40:34.080 --> 05:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
highest between 42 days and 365 days
postpartum

05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
postpartum
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
which is why this going from 60 to 365
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
days is so important
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
pregnancy-related complications include
 
05:40:44.708 --> 05:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
high blood pressure blood clots
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease stroke and other
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
heart problems like cardiomyopathy which
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
may not surface until weeks or months
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
after delivering a baby
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
and again medicaid plays a very
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
important role
 
05:41:01.110 --> 05:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
in improving maternal and perinatal
 
05:41:01.120 --> 05:41:02.150 align:start position:0%
in improving maternal and perinatal
outcomes

05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
05:41:04.470 --> 05:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
timely postpartum visits provide an
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address chronic and
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy related health conditions such
 
05:41:10.470 --> 05:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
as diabetes and hypertension
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
mental health status including
 
05:41:14.070 --> 05:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression which is very
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
common amongst
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
delivering mothers and substance use
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
disorders while new hampshire has
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid and subsidized health
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
coverage to many low-income residents
 
05:41:24.400 --> 05:41:25.190 align:start position:0%
coverage to many low-income residents
it

05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
its eligibility rules that end
 
05:41:29.830 --> 05:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage after 60 days can
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
result in
 
05:41:34.390 --> 05:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
disruptions in coverage and care
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
and so again this is really for for
 
05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
low-income women
 
05:41:39.280 --> 05:41:40.708 align:start position:0%
low-income women
who

05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:41:43.990 --> 05:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
could very well have risk factors for a
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
myriad of of illnesses
 
05:41:47.910 --> 05:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
including cardiovascular disease they
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
might not know they have these risk
 
05:41:51.910 --> 05:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
factors it may not appear until beyond
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
that 60 days when when these women are
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
about to lose their coverage according
 
05:41:59.350 --> 05:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
to our current medicaid standards in new
 
05:41:59.360 --> 05:42:00.628 align:start position:0%
to our current medicaid standards in new
hampshire

05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:42:02.948 --> 05:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
so again i highly encourage you to
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
i am not a specialist or an expert on
 
05:42:11.110 --> 05:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid um so i'm i hopefully those
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
other individuals were able to answer
 
05:42:14.788 --> 05:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
your questions um but basically this is
 
05:42:17.670 --> 05:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
a population of of women who do not have
 
05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
any health care coverage at all
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
05:42:24.548 --> 05:42:24.558 align:start position:0%
when they are pregnant that is when they
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
would then become eligible for medicaid
 
05:42:29.270 --> 05:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and then only able to stay on it for
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
those 60 days while their their newborn
 
05:42:33.910 --> 05:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
baby is able to stay on its coverage for
 
05:42:36.070 --> 05:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
for a full year so we really want to
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that that the mothers are
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
remaining as healthy as they can
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
and able to be a mother to that new baby
 
05:42:46.230 --> 05:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
so a couple of questions from the chair
 
05:42:48.070 --> 05:42:48.080 align:start position:0%

um just take about a
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%

05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
executive session relative to
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%

disability services
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
and you will remember this bill um it
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
was presented by
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative abel from grafton county
 
05:59:14.400 --> 05:59:15.830 align:start position:0%
representative abel from grafton county
concerned

05:59:15.830 --> 05:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
05:59:15.840 --> 05:59:16.868 align:start position:0%
concerned
about

05:59:16.868 --> 05:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:59:16.878 --> 05:59:17.590 align:start position:0%
about
a

05:59:17.590 --> 05:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:59:19.990 --> 05:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
family that was not
 
05:59:22.470 --> 05:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
at that time getting the help they
 
05:59:22.480 --> 05:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
at that time getting the help they
should

05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
05:59:26.788 --> 05:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
since that time um the family has gotten
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
to help at least it's now going on i
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:33.600 --> 05:59:34.868 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
as i think many of you know i do a fair
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
bit of work with the dd community out of
 
05:59:43.030 --> 05:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
the area agencies based in portsmouth
 
05:59:46.230 --> 05:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
and in atkinson one of my towns
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
and so i ran this bill by
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
numbers of people in the dd community
 
05:59:52.798 --> 05:59:53.910 align:start position:0%
numbers of people in the dd community
and

05:59:53.910 --> 05:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
all of them came back to me all of them
 
05:59:59.190 --> 05:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
that came back to me said they don't
 
06:00:02.830 --> 06:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
this being added and that being added
 
06:00:07.030 --> 06:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
and that being added that being added
 
06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
and so on because in their opinion the
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
general clause that follows any other
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
condition of an individual found to be
 
06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
closely related to an intellectual
 
06:00:18.628 --> 06:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
disability blah blah blah
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
covers that
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so they're good so the dd
 
06:00:26.628 --> 06:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
people said
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
very well intended
 
06:00:31.110 --> 06:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
the individual family has been looked
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
after but they don't really want the
 
06:00:35.510 --> 06:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill to go forward
 
06:00:37.190 --> 06:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
so the chair
 
06:00:37.200 --> 06:00:38.868 align:start position:0%
so the chair
moves

06:00:38.868 --> 06:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
moves
 
06:00:38.878 --> 06:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
moves
itl

06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
itl
 
06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
and would look for a second
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you
 
06:00:47.280 --> 06:00:49.830 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you
um

06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify because
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of a
 
06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding at least on my part uh
 
06:01:03.910 --> 06:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of that session we had uh
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
spoken about the fact that uh we did not
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
need to add it because it was already
 
06:01:09.990 --> 06:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
covered and we had begun to discuss
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not we could come up with a
 
06:01:14.470 --> 06:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
new definition and you charged
 
06:01:16.230 --> 06:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
christina dyer with getting information
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
from other states and i reached out to
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
melissa namath from dhh test regarding
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
working with her on that
 
06:01:22.240 --> 06:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
working with her on that
um

06:01:23.350 --> 06:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:25.830 --> 06:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
i i thought that was to actually work on
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
it for this bill but as it evolved we
 
06:01:30.310 --> 06:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
realized that was really beyond the
 
06:01:32.070 --> 06:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
scope of what we're trying to do here
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
would not be something good to do sort
 
06:01:36.310 --> 06:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
of in a rush here and then it might be a
 
06:01:38.310 --> 06:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
good idea for another year but not here
 
06:01:40.470 --> 06:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to let everybody know
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
that that line of inquiry has been
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
dropped so i am very comfortable with
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
just moving the itl
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
sorry joining you on the itl thank you
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that we were you know they were
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
asking to amend
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
really didn't cover their situation it
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
was really for
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'll say developmentally disabled the dd
 
06:02:15.680 --> 06:02:17.110 align:start position:0%
i'll say developmentally disabled the dd
community

06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
very quickly said oh yes um
 
06:02:22.390 --> 06:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
this familial autonomia
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
is covered under the broad definition it
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
was just a little hiccup along the way
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
nor did they see that this would be a
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
good time to work on
 
06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
amending the uh language for broad
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
categories but they would certainly be
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
open to working with people who wish to
 
06:02:43.990 --> 06:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%

06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
requiring child care investigatory
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
findings to be published in a timely
 
06:05:38.548 --> 06:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
manner that splits the infinitive
 
06:05:38.558 --> 06:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
manner that splits the infinitive
um

06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:46.470 --> 06:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to move
 
06:05:50.030 --> 06:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:52.470 --> 06:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
20220354 which has been distributed to
 
06:05:52.480 --> 06:05:54.788 align:start position:0%
20220354 which has been distributed to
everybody

06:05:54.788 --> 06:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:05:57.590 --> 06:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
and what does the amendment do
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay during the hearing you may recall
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
that it was brought up by the people
 
06:06:03.830 --> 06:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
from dhhs
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that on line eight of the bill
 
06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
this is on one page bill on line eight
 
06:06:12.788 --> 06:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
it said 21 days that should be 21
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
business days very important distinction
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
so the only change on this is that in
 
06:06:19.350 --> 06:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
line eight of the amendment
 
06:06:22.708 --> 06:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
it is 21 business days
 
06:06:25.190 --> 06:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
the other piece that came up that uh i
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
had asked her about well actually i
 
06:06:29.350 --> 06:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
think somebody that the sponsor had
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
commented on initially and i followed up
 
06:06:30.878 --> 06:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
commented on initially and i followed up
on

06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
is the question of how do we track
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh and can there be a cross-reference on
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
an owner or an operator so that if they
 
06:06:39.990 --> 06:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
just change the name they don't get to
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
open up a new place and not not be
 
06:06:42.000 --> 06:06:43.190 align:start position:0%
open up a new place and not not be
caught

06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
caught
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that that already
 
06:06:48.070 --> 06:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
exists in rules the license is to the
 
06:06:48.080 --> 06:06:48.948 align:start position:0%
exists in rules the license is to the
owner

06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
owner
 
06:06:51.510 --> 06:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
um it is not transferable to a new
 
06:06:53.830 --> 06:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
location or new uh if there's a new name
 
06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
they have to notify
 
06:06:57.750 --> 06:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so the bottom line is it follows that
 
06:06:59.830 --> 06:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
person so they can't just go change the
 
06:07:02.150 --> 06:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
name or move it and then escape
 
06:07:04.390 --> 06:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
detection so we do not need to put
 
06:07:06.390 --> 06:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
anything in about cross-referencing
 
06:07:07.910 --> 06:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
because that already is in rule so
 
06:07:09.910 --> 06:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the amendment is simpler
 
06:07:12.788 --> 06:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
than it would have otherwise been
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative canark moves his
 
06:07:17.350 --> 06:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
amendment zero three five four h do i
 
06:07:19.590 --> 06:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.390 --> 06:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the amendment
 
06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you can use your microphone
 
06:07:44.310 --> 06:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
did we have to strike something you said
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's simpler
 
06:07:48.070 --> 06:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
so what part got struck to make it
 
06:07:49.990 --> 06:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
simpler did i answer
 
06:07:51.990 --> 06:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes no nothing is struck i'm just
 
06:07:53.430 --> 06:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
saying it's a simple amendment it just
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
adds the word business
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
so nothing is struck it just we had
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
business days
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
we had considered some other things
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
right that's what i was speaking about
 
06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
we were talking about do we need
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
language to to prevent people changing
 
06:08:06.788 --> 06:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
the name that doesn't need to be done
 
06:08:08.310 --> 06:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
because it already exists in rules
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
already done yep thank you okay
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
okay please call the roll on the
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%

apart this was the fall and then covert

hit and everything fell apart but she uh
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
she followed it through and kept at it
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
and even though she's insanely busy she
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
can't she came up and this is one of the
 
06:10:17.760 --> 06:10:18.708 align:start position:0%
can't she came up and this is one of the
big

big
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
findings that we had since then the
 
06:10:23.430 --> 06:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation in the department has
 
06:10:25.350 --> 06:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
has improved dramatically and i've heard
 
06:10:26.788 --> 06:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
that i checked around some people that
 
06:10:28.868 --> 06:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
testified with us so things have gotten
 
06:10:30.628 --> 06:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
better but some things we do want to get
 
06:10:32.868 --> 06:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
into legislation just to make sure so
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is all overall a successful um
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh episode so are you part of that group
 
06:10:40.708 --> 06:10:40.718 align:start position:0%

06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
of issues but they're they've been
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
largely dealt with so
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%

representative canark would you write
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
the committee report please of course
 
06:12:08.470 --> 06:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:08.480 --> 06:12:10.788 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:15.910 --> 06:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:20.470 --> 06:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:23.670 --> 06:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
this concludes the exec session on house
 
06:12:32.070 --> 06:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:32.080 --> 06:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
reopen

06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
reopen
 
06:12:38.390 --> 06:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1619 fn
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
we had recessed this for a very good
 
06:12:47.120 --> 06:12:48.548 align:start position:0%
we had recessed this for a very good
reason

06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
reason
 
06:12:50.310 --> 06:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
and representative canarch speak to that
 
06:12:53.510 --> 06:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
well there are a couple of things
 
06:12:56.548 --> 06:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
actually let me kind of catch you up
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
well what i caught was or well actually
 
06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
it was called by mike holt uh all of us
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
missed the fact that it was a wrong
 
06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
statutory reference it was placed into
 
06:13:05.760 --> 06:13:06.830 align:start position:0%
statutory reference it was placed into
uh

06:13:06.830 --> 06:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
126 x 1 9 a
 
06:13:12.150 --> 06:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
2 and those are that's the list of
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
symptoms but a migraine is a diagnosis
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
not a symptom
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i prepared an amendment which is
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
before you that is 0 3 5 5 that just
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
simply places it in section 1 which is
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
the list of diagnoses
 
06:13:26.948 --> 06:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
now that doesn't mean that i think
 
06:13:29.110 --> 06:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we should do necessarily but
 
06:13:31.030 --> 06:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
i wish to be a good boy scout and be
 
06:13:33.270 --> 06:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
prepared and have this available should
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
that be the will of the committee in our
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
conversation before we recessed it
 
06:13:38.948 --> 06:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
seemed that the will of the committee
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
was similar to 1480 not to start making
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
various exhaustive lists because we
 
06:13:44.788 --> 06:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
already have
 
06:13:46.868 --> 06:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
an umbrella diagnosis of chronic pain
 
06:13:48.230 --> 06:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
and again the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:13:50.390 --> 06:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board felt that in its
 
06:13:52.868 --> 06:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
unofficial recommendation that chronic
 
06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
pain which includes both persistent and
 
06:13:57.350 --> 06:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
intermittent would already cover
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
migraine headache
 
06:14:01.270 --> 06:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify the concern of the sponsor
 
06:14:03.990 --> 06:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
and her constituent had been stigma and
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
not meaning in this case just a label or
 
06:14:06.868 --> 06:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
a name
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
but also the concern about insurance
 
06:14:11.190 --> 06:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
issues if the records are
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
pulled up sometime that they'd have a
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis then a chronic pain
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
i had revealed that they're not revealed
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
clarified that these records are
 
06:14:21.190 --> 06:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
confidential within the therapeutic
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis program nobody knows what box
 
06:14:25.430 --> 06:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
you checked to become certified
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
however the data would be in the
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
provider's record but the provider can
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly do this very easily i was a
 
06:14:32.000 --> 06:14:33.190 align:start position:0%
certainly do this very easily i was a
background

06:14:33.190 --> 06:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
background
 
06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
i did back pain
 
06:14:36.390 --> 06:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
if i was certifying a patient i would
 
06:14:36.400 --> 06:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
if i was certifying a patient i would
say

06:14:37.590 --> 06:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the record not to be deceptive but i
 
06:14:40.948 --> 06:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
would just say they've been struggling
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
with back pain now for three years
 
06:14:44.070 --> 06:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
things haven't worked well and i have
 
06:14:45.750 --> 06:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
now sent them off to be certified for
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
06:14:47.760 --> 06:14:48.708 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
period

06:14:48.708 --> 06:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
period
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
so that concept could actually apply to
 
06:14:52.948 --> 06:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
other issues say abortion for example
 
06:14:52.958 --> 06:14:54.230 align:start position:0%
other issues say abortion for example
records

06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
records
 
06:14:54.240 --> 06:14:55.030 align:start position:0%
records
huh

06:14:55.030 --> 06:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
huh
 
06:14:56.788 --> 06:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
can let me let me finish this so the
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
point of the matter is that the
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh you would not then say and i checked
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
the box chronic pain
 
06:15:04.708 --> 06:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
because you would it would be understood
 
06:15:04.718 --> 06:15:05.590 align:start position:0%
because you would it would be understood
that

06:15:05.590 --> 06:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:07.510 --> 06:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
back pain is a as a pain and if it's
 
06:15:08.708 --> 06:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
been there a long time it's a chronic
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
pain so the issue is the word chronic
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
pain if the constituent is concerned
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
about that never needs to exist in the
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
medical record and that's not being
 
06:15:18.150 --> 06:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
deceptive it's because you'd be putting
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
down what the diagnosis
 
06:15:21.350 --> 06:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:15:21.360 --> 06:15:22.310 align:start position:0%
would be
so

06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:22.320 --> 06:15:23.190 align:start position:0%
so
the

06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:15:25.110 --> 06:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
that little bit of a glitch could be
 
06:15:26.708 --> 06:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
taken care of because the concern we had
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
was we start adding lots of diagnoses
 
06:15:31.750 --> 06:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
that then you begin having that slice
 
06:15:33.190 --> 06:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
and dice thing that we just finished on
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
1480. the other thing is that
 
06:15:38.230 --> 06:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
tcmob did not specifically vet this
 
06:15:39.910 --> 06:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
under migraine because we also know that
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
migraines have other symptoms and we do
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
not have a good evidence that we know of
 
06:15:45.670 --> 06:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
for whether or not it helps with the
 
06:15:48.310 --> 06:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
visual auras and all that kind of stuff
 
06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
but it's really for dealing with the
 
06:15:52.470 --> 06:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
pain phenomena so that that is
 
06:15:54.548 --> 06:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
that was just the concept and i so i'm
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
not gonna
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying we have to do this
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
amendment i just wanted to have it
 
06:16:00.390 --> 06:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
available to you all
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like if we want to keep it
 
06:16:06.150 --> 06:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
broad we don't need the amendment
 
06:16:08.708 --> 06:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
if we want to
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
reference it specifically which it
 
06:16:12.868 --> 06:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're not so sure we do we
 
06:16:13.990 --> 06:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
have the amendment in hand
 
06:16:15.590 --> 06:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'd like to speak to
 
06:16:18.310 --> 06:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:16:18.320 --> 06:16:19.190 align:start position:0%
the amendment
um

06:16:19.190 --> 06:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:20.788 --> 06:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
i believe first of all i want to thank
 
06:16:23.110 --> 06:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
the boy scout to my left
 
06:16:24.470 --> 06:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
did a great job bringing this to the
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee ahead of time just in case we
 
06:16:28.548 --> 06:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
had to pull it out of the back pocket
 
06:16:30.150 --> 06:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
but i would go back i think the way it's
 
06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
worded right now
 
06:16:34.548 --> 06:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
it talks about moderate to severe pain
 
06:16:36.390 --> 06:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
goes to modern severe
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
migraine headaches the word pain has
 
06:16:40.708 --> 06:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
been eliminated and i do have a concern
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
with that because by eliminating the
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
word pain and
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
inserting the words migraine headaches
 
06:16:48.390 --> 06:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
it narrows it down to just migraine
 
06:16:50.948 --> 06:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
headaches for pain not chronic pain
 
06:16:53.750 --> 06:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
in a total sense yeah i answer that
 
06:16:53.760 --> 06:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
in a total sense yeah i answer that
yes

06:16:55.910 --> 06:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:16:57.270 --> 06:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
chronic pain is already a standalone
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
condition to begin with so that is
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
covered um i did not choose to make this
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
a standalone condition because again
 
06:17:04.868 --> 06:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
there are other features of migraines
 
06:17:07.430 --> 06:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
other than just the pain but remember to
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
qualify you have to have section one
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
and there's the conjunction section two
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
and section two does have
 
06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a symptom severe pain that has not
 
06:17:18.868 --> 06:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
responded to previously prescribed
 
06:17:20.788 --> 06:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
medication or surgical measures or for
 
06:17:21.990 --> 06:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
which other treatment options have
 
06:17:24.230 --> 06:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
produced serious side effects
 
06:17:24.240 --> 06:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
produced serious side effects
yeah

06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:17:26.868 --> 06:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
so the point is
 
06:17:28.948 --> 06:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
the they would qualify by having chronic
 
06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
migraine headaches as their diagnosis
 
06:17:34.070 --> 06:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
and pain in section 2 as their symptom
 
06:17:35.830 --> 06:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
because it isn't and you have to have
 
06:17:38.868 --> 06:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
both of those so that's why it's there
 
06:17:40.948 --> 06:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
how about the question of the citation
 
06:17:45.270 --> 06:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
can that be handled in enrolled bills
 
06:17:45.280 --> 06:17:46.150 align:start position:0%
can that be handled in enrolled bills
huh

06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
huh
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm sorry i i do not know
 
06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that i'm confusing myself so
 
06:17:51.440 --> 06:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that i'm confusing myself so
good

06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:17:54.548 --> 06:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why you shouldn't be
 
06:17:56.150 --> 06:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
too so i withdraw that yes
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman not that i want to
 
06:18:01.670 --> 06:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
get home early but why are we talking
 
06:18:03.190 --> 06:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
about the amendment which we're not
 
06:18:05.430 --> 06:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
06:18:08.070 --> 06:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
because we're actually talking about
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:15.190 --> 06:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:16.788 --> 06:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my really serious
 
06:18:21.430 --> 06:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
question i understand the difference
 
06:18:24.708 --> 06:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
between uh the this rsa
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
section well
 
06:18:28.708 --> 06:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph one or paragraph two so
 
06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
paragraph one is medical conditions
 
06:18:32.878 --> 06:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
paragraph one is medical conditions
right

06:18:33.990 --> 06:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:18:34.000 --> 06:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
right
and

06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:37.270 --> 06:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
is the one that's first listed in the
 
06:18:40.788 --> 06:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
which talks about severe pain that
 
06:18:45.750 --> 06:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like a condition rather than
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:49.440 --> 06:18:50.868 align:start position:0%
 
please

06:18:50.868 --> 06:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:18:53.110 --> 06:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes pain can be a diagnosis or a
 
06:18:55.030 --> 06:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
condition as well and it is as i say
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
does exist as a standalone the issue is
 
06:18:59.990 --> 06:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you may have for example uh
 
06:19:02.310 --> 06:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
ehler-danlos syndrome which is listed on
 
06:19:04.310 --> 06:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment on page eight and nine and
 
06:19:06.468 --> 06:19:06.478 align:start position:0%
that may give you pain so what we're
 
06:19:09.190 --> 06:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
doing is the symptom is pain sorry let's
 
06:19:11.110 --> 06:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
keep into this that the hallway the law
 
06:19:12.788 --> 06:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
was written which has been a bit of a
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
burden for us over time is it has this
 
06:19:17.190 --> 06:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
conjunction and you have to have a
 
06:19:19.350 --> 06:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
condition or a diagnosis listed in
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
section one
 
06:19:23.110 --> 06:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
and a symptom that is caused by that
 
06:19:24.868 --> 06:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
condition or diagnosis
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
in section two in order to be able to
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
certify it is a bit cumbersome
 
06:19:29.680 --> 06:19:30.708 align:start position:0%
certify it is a bit cumbersome
um

06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:32.548 --> 06:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
but that's the way the law
 
06:19:34.230 --> 06:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
has been written and we did we have
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've tried we've tried changing that in
 
06:19:37.030 --> 06:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
the past has been have not been
 
06:19:37.040 --> 06:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
the past has been have not been
successful

06:19:39.990 --> 06:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
successful
 
06:19:41.350 --> 06:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:19:45.510 --> 06:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
so we do want to continue we do want to
 
06:19:48.468 --> 06:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
uh use your amendment so that we now
 
06:19:50.390 --> 06:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
have a condition no
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
no no no no can i clarify the issue is i
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to be prepared my sense of the
 
06:19:59.430 --> 06:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
group was they wanted to itl the bill
 
06:20:02.390 --> 06:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not needed because it is a
 
06:20:03.670 --> 06:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
migraine is already included as a
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
chronic pain so we just don't need to
 
06:20:07.270 --> 06:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
say it it's that just like we got into
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
in 1480 adding various things they're
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
already covered
 
06:20:12.150 --> 06:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
so you don't need to start adding that
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i thought that was the will of the
 
06:20:15.510 --> 06:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee but i wanted to be prepared so
 
06:20:17.350 --> 06:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
if i misread the will of the committee i
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
had this amendment if they instead did
 
06:20:20.948 --> 06:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
want to add this as a qualifying
 
06:20:20.958 --> 06:20:22.468 align:start position:0%
want to add this as a qualifying
condition

06:20:22.468 --> 06:20:22.478 align:start position:0%
condition
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
so does that mean we leave
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
we leave the bill as written or just
 
06:20:28.788 --> 06:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
kill the hope we just killed a bill and
 
06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
i yes i make a motion to i
 
06:20:32.948 --> 06:20:32.958 align:start position:0%

ten years ago when we first started

chairs was you don't leave until it's in
 
06:23:37.110 --> 06:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
the chair's hand
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
i don't do that why should you so
 
06:23:47.190 --> 06:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:53.590 --> 06:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that ends the exact session on 16 19
 
06:23:58.430 --> 06:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
and the next one is 15
 
06:24:01.590 --> 06:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
37 i think
 
06:24:04.150 --> 06:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't have it
 
06:24:08.468 --> 06:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
so what is 15 37 15 37 my pirate mental
 
06:24:11.030 --> 06:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
health okay the pilot
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
drop-in thing okay thank you i'll find
 
06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's in the pile here somewhere
 
06:24:15.920 --> 06:24:17.990 align:start position:0%
it's in the pile here somewhere
um

06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:20.310 --> 06:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
anybody want to talk about it first
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
 
06:24:26.638 --> 06:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
um

06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:31.430 --> 06:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
first i want to talk just briefly about
 
06:24:34.468 --> 06:24:34.478 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
a mental health plan
 
06:24:39.270 --> 06:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's a guide that
 
06:24:41.910 --> 06:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
was developed by hundreds of people
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
working over an
 
06:24:46.230 --> 06:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
extensive period of time
 
06:24:49.510 --> 06:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it outlines every single part
 
06:24:51.990 --> 06:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
of the mental health system
 
06:24:52.000 --> 06:24:53.430 align:start position:0%
of the mental health system
in

06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:24:53.440 --> 06:24:54.390 align:start position:0%
in
page

06:24:54.390 --> 06:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:24:58.310 --> 06:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
31 and 32 of the original by the way
 
06:24:59.590 --> 06:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
i've asked
 
06:25:01.190 --> 06:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
john to
 
06:25:03.190 --> 06:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
get us a copy of the state plan for
 
06:25:04.948 --> 06:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
everybody here
 
06:25:07.830 --> 06:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
so that as these mental health issues
 
06:25:10.150 --> 06:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
come up we have that
 
06:25:10.160 --> 06:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
come up we have that
and

06:25:11.590 --> 06:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:14.468 --> 06:25:14.478 align:start position:0%
representative acton and also when we
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
any day now activate the
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh caucus
 
06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i would very much like to have you
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
06:25:25.910 --> 06:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to volunteer as a
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
technical assistant to be able to get
 
06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the zooms together
 
06:25:31.910 --> 06:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
however we meet wow that's exactly one
 
06:25:33.510 --> 06:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we've been struggling
 
06:25:35.190 --> 06:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
with the computer guy you know you're
 
06:25:38.868 --> 06:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:40.708 --> 06:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
there must be some kind of an award for
 
06:25:40.718 --> 06:25:48.708 align:start position:0%
there must be some kind of an award for
that

06:25:48.708 --> 06:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
she's well-meaning
 
06:26:09.990 --> 06:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:10.000 --> 06:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
essentially

06:26:11.830 --> 06:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:26:13.190 --> 06:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:26:14.948 --> 06:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
deals with something that's already
 
06:26:14.958 --> 06:26:16.150 align:start position:0%
deals with something that's already
happened

06:26:16.150 --> 06:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
happened
 
06:26:19.030 --> 06:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
the department has been following the
 
06:26:20.628 --> 06:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
state plan
 
06:26:24.310 --> 06:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
and has developed a series of
 
06:26:26.548 --> 06:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
of these peer
 
06:26:29.510 --> 06:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
focused recovery facilities
 
06:26:32.628 --> 06:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
essentially the difference between
 
06:26:35.190 --> 06:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
what is in the bill and what the
 
06:26:37.190 --> 06:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
department has done
 
06:26:38.830 --> 06:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
is that she
 
06:26:41.190 --> 06:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
has she meaning
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
has put in there
 
06:26:48.150 --> 06:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
a drop-in center
 
06:26:50.230 --> 06:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
which is no part of
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
what the
 
06:26:54.868 --> 06:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
state department wanted
 
06:26:57.030 --> 06:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
a drop-in center
 
06:26:59.830 --> 06:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
creates a serious problem
 
06:27:02.230 --> 06:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of management because
 
06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
with most of these recovery centers
 
06:27:07.270 --> 06:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
essentially recovery
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
means individuals
 
06:27:11.910 --> 06:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
who have had a mental illness of their
 
06:27:11.920 --> 06:27:12.788 align:start position:0%
who have had a mental illness of their
own

06:27:12.788 --> 06:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
own
 
06:27:14.468 --> 06:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
and recover
 
06:27:16.390 --> 06:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
06:27:19.510 --> 06:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
they can be supportive of individuals
 
06:27:21.750 --> 06:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
who have the same individual who have
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
the same problem
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
but that have not recovered
 
06:27:27.190 --> 06:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:27:30.150 --> 06:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
that is a very supportive service
 
06:27:30.160 --> 06:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
that is a very supportive service
unfortunately

06:27:31.910 --> 06:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
the plan talks about recovery people
 
06:27:37.350 --> 06:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
doing psychotherapy that they are not
 
06:27:39.110 --> 06:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
qualified to do
 
06:27:41.430 --> 06:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy and i would hope that
 
06:27:41.440 --> 06:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy and i would hope that
the

06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:27:44.868 --> 06:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
latest rendition of these plans
 
06:27:46.468 --> 06:27:46.478 align:start position:0%
says so
 
06:27:46.478 --> 06:27:47.190 align:start position:0%
says so
the

06:27:47.190 --> 06:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:27:51.270 --> 06:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
the best use of this support
 
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
peer support system
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
is to work in tandem
 
06:27:58.708 --> 06:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
with the existing mental health systems
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore the department's position
 
06:28:05.190 --> 06:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
is essentially that
 
06:28:05.200 --> 06:28:06.150 align:start position:0%
is essentially that
the

06:28:06.150 --> 06:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:28:08.150 --> 06:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
recovery system that's
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's in place
 
06:28:13.830 --> 06:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
be made a part of integrated part
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the existing mental health system
 
06:28:19.510 --> 06:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially
 
06:28:22.708 --> 06:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
the only difference from what this
 
06:28:25.590 --> 06:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh legislation would do that the
 
06:28:27.350 --> 06:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
department has already done everything
 
06:28:29.430 --> 06:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
else that's
 
06:28:29.440 --> 06:28:30.548 align:start position:0%
else that's
needed

06:28:30.548 --> 06:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
needed
 
06:28:30.558 --> 06:28:32.948 align:start position:0%
needed
already

06:28:32.948 --> 06:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:28:35.430 --> 06:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
that so i'm hoping
 
06:28:39.190 --> 06:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we can as a matter of policy
 
06:28:41.990 --> 06:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
use that 10-year plan
 
06:28:42.000 --> 06:28:42.868 align:start position:0%
use that 10-year plan
and

06:28:42.868 --> 06:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:45.590 --> 06:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
and just as a very quick
 
06:28:47.510 --> 06:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
comment which has nothing to do with
 
06:28:49.190 --> 06:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:28:49.200 --> 06:28:50.788 align:start position:0%
this bill
the

06:28:50.788 --> 06:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's a application to the joint
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%

06:28:58.548 --> 06:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
for 17 million dollars from the federal
 
06:29:00.788 --> 06:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic aid funds
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
that to provide for inpatient care for
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
the mentally ill
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
17 million that's extremely important
 
06:29:12.230 --> 06:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
also fulfill spagnulo
 
06:29:13.990 --> 06:29:14.000 align:start position:0%

which is over in commerce
 
06:29:19.990 --> 06:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
06:29:22.390 --> 06:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
insurance mental health coverage
 
06:29:23.750 --> 06:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
so that i
 
06:29:23.760 --> 06:29:25.030 align:start position:0%
so that i
move

06:29:25.030 --> 06:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
move
 
06:29:25.040 --> 06:29:26.390 align:start position:0%
move
itl

06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
itl
 
06:29:31.510 --> 06:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.110 --> 06:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
somebody from the side of the playground
 
06:29:37.270 --> 06:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative king seconds
 
06:29:42.150 --> 06:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:47.270 --> 06:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:50.390 --> 06:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
i know this has been said already but um
 
06:29:52.230 --> 06:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight has brought
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
several bills this year and previously
 
06:29:57.030 --> 06:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i just want to
 
06:29:59.910 --> 06:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that um
 
06:30:02.468 --> 06:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
she is someone who won't stop talking
 
06:30:05.110 --> 06:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
about the lack the inadequate resources
 
06:30:07.190 --> 06:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
that we have and i give her a lot of
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
credit for that
 
06:30:11.830 --> 06:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
because the resources
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
are inadequate and um
 
06:30:17.510 --> 06:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
even though it seems like we itl
 
06:30:19.830 --> 06:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
most of all of her bills i want to give
 
06:30:21.830 --> 06:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
her credit for kind of standing up and
 
06:30:25.030 --> 06:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
saying something's not quite right
 
06:30:26.868 --> 06:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
when member of parliament william
 
06:30:30.230 --> 06:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
wilberforce first rose to
 
06:30:30.240 --> 06:30:31.430 align:start position:0%
wilberforce first rose to

empire he got one vote his own

06:32:19.990 --> 06:32:20.000 align:start position:0%

06:32:23.840 --> 06:32:26.628 align:start position:0%
write the committee report for us please
um

06:32:26.628 --> 06:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:28.788 --> 06:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
point the order sure
 
06:32:31.110 --> 06:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
i would just like to um
 
06:32:32.628 --> 06:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
talk about something that's been on my
 
06:32:34.708 --> 06:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
mind a little bit and i should have done
 
06:32:36.788 --> 06:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
it before these bills were executives so
 
06:32:38.548 --> 06:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the wrong time but we
 
06:32:40.150 --> 06:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
can go on from here
 
06:32:40.160 --> 06:32:41.190 align:start position:0%
can go on from here
um

06:32:41.190 --> 06:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:43.670 --> 06:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
as we all know there's a new mechanism
 
06:32:45.510 --> 06:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
for signing in
 
06:32:49.190 --> 06:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of or opposed to bills
 
06:32:49.200 --> 06:32:50.390 align:start position:0%
in favor of or opposed to bills
and

06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:53.190 --> 06:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
so when constituents ask me how they can
 
06:32:55.590 --> 06:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
participate i've been telling them about
 
06:32:55.600 --> 06:32:56.548 align:start position:0%
participate i've been telling them about
that

06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:59.590 --> 06:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:33:02.468 --> 06:33:02.478 align:start position:0%
i feel badly that when we go to exec
 
06:33:05.030 --> 06:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
bills we don't take those numbers into
 
06:33:05.040 --> 06:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
bills we don't take those numbers into
consideration

06:33:07.030 --> 06:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
06:33:08.788 --> 06:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
06:33:11.910 --> 06:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
even though judging from my emails many
 
06:33:14.948 --> 06:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
many many of the numbers will be
 
06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to what i'm for
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
06:33:20.868 --> 06:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
the correct thing to do to be more
 
06:33:23.190 --> 06:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
democratic rather than less democratic
 
06:33:25.510 --> 06:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a small thing to just as the
 
06:33:28.868 --> 06:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
part of each executive
 
06:33:30.788 --> 06:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
session to announce how many people
 
06:33:32.948 --> 06:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
signed in for and how many people signed
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
in opposed
 
06:33:36.150 --> 06:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
i know some committees do it and some
 
06:33:38.150 --> 06:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
committees have never done it but i'm
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:46.868 --> 06:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah i i'd have to talk with
 
06:33:46.878 --> 06:33:47.990 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah i i'd have to talk with
lindsay

06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
lindsay
 
06:33:50.230 --> 06:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to get it's it's i know
 
06:33:52.150 --> 06:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
but then we also have to include those
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
people who signed in on the day of the
 
06:33:57.590 --> 06:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
hearing so i need to i'll just need to
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
coordinate that we'll i'll figure it out
 
06:34:00.628 --> 06:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
how to do it
 
06:34:03.030 --> 06:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i think as you you know that
 
06:34:06.390 --> 06:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
with um rarest of exceptions
 
06:34:06.400 --> 06:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
with um rarest of exceptions
um

06:34:07.510 --> 06:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:10.628 --> 06:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
the bills that we are executing i have
 
06:34:13.430 --> 06:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
checked with representative weber to see
 
06:34:15.110 --> 06:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
are we good to go
 
06:34:17.110 --> 06:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
and since there's that advance notice
 
06:34:19.030 --> 06:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
and not anything just
 
06:34:21.110 --> 06:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
on a whim for me
 
06:34:23.030 --> 06:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
we will have the time to get that
 
06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
information if people think that this is
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
a good idea to do so
 
06:34:30.628 --> 06:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:34:31.670 --> 06:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:35.030 --> 06:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
i need to learn how to use the uh the
 
06:34:38.628 --> 06:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
information on in gen court
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm under the impression we're supposed
 
06:34:43.670 --> 06:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to even see it
 
06:34:43.680 --> 06:34:45.350 align:start position:0%
to be able to even see it
uh

06:34:45.350 --> 06:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:47.750 --> 06:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
david's saying it doesn't it's very
 
06:34:47.760 --> 06:34:48.948 align:start position:0%
david's saying it doesn't it's very
difficult

06:34:48.948 --> 06:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
06:34:50.788 --> 06:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
you can see it it's very easy there's a
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
number on top of how many people signed
 
06:34:55.030 --> 06:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
in favor how many against how many
 
06:34:56.708 --> 06:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
people uploaded
 
06:34:58.948 --> 06:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
comments and you can see everybody's
 
06:34:58.958 --> 06:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
comments and you can see everybody's
name

06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
name
 
06:35:03.510 --> 06:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
so we could add that to the tally sheet
 
06:35:06.150 --> 06:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
plus like you say the blue sheet
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
although i am technically not a luddite
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
i have great sympathy for people who are
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
illiterate in these matters and if
 
06:35:15.270 --> 06:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who would like to
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
like to
 
06:35:19.670 --> 06:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
get me this information then when it
 
06:35:22.868 --> 06:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
looks like we're going to exec a bill um
 
06:35:24.390 --> 06:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
or even now
 
06:35:26.310 --> 06:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
if the hearing's over we have that
 
06:35:27.910 --> 06:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
information i don't think you can sign
 
06:35:30.788 --> 06:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
up after the hearing is over can you
 
06:35:33.270 --> 06:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
11 59. say it again
 
06:35:35.750 --> 06:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
you can sign up until 11 59 of the day
 
06:35:37.350 --> 06:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the hearing so they can't until
 
06:35:38.628 --> 06:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
midnight tonight
 
06:35:40.708 --> 06:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
okay so everything that we've heard
 
06:35:43.510 --> 06:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
other than today
 
06:35:44.948 --> 06:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
is done
 
06:35:47.350 --> 06:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
and is there somebody who would like to
 
06:35:48.788 --> 06:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
be um
 
06:35:50.868 --> 06:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
the person that gets that information
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna bet that's not why you put
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
your hand up no it's not um
 
06:35:57.590 --> 06:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
the reason i put my hand up is that we
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
asked no i was looking at representative
 
06:36:02.150 --> 06:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
snow oh i'm sorry
 
06:36:02.160 --> 06:36:03.030 align:start position:0%
snow oh i'm sorry
but

06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:36:04.628 --> 06:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
why did you put your hand up
 
06:36:07.910 --> 06:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
well could we ask the researcher
 
06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
that data is probably there for her to
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
assemble that information for us i think
 
06:36:14.070 --> 06:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'll commit about i
 
06:36:16.310 --> 06:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
want to make a comment on it is
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm carrying a lot of positive things
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
from the constituents and the public in
 
06:36:21.670 --> 06:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
general because all of our meetings are
 
06:36:24.628 --> 06:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
now being broadcast on webcam or
 
06:36:26.310 --> 06:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
youtube and so forth and opening up for
 
06:36:28.390 --> 06:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
greater transparency what we do here
 
06:36:30.390 --> 06:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
down in concord because it does impact
 
06:36:31.990 --> 06:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
their lives and i think there's another
 
06:36:33.990 --> 06:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
data element to it to bring greater
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:40.628 --> 06:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
did we just did we close the hearing on
 
06:36:42.548 --> 06:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
this yet
 
06:36:45.510 --> 06:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay um with that
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
i closed the hearing on house bill 1537
 
06:36:50.628 --> 06:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i will talk to the committee
 
06:36:52.708 --> 06:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
researcher to have that information in
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
hand representative snow and
 
06:36:58.948 --> 06:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
then and his faithful microphone friend
 
06:37:00.868 --> 06:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
representative snow and his faithful
 
06:37:03.110 --> 06:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
microphone friend oh yeah my friend
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
there it is
 
06:37:04.878 --> 06:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
there it is
sorry

06:37:06.070 --> 06:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the uh fact of the matter is we're still
 
06:37:09.430 --> 06:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
not getting the names i don't know if
 
06:37:11.670 --> 06:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
any of the rest of you i've gotten a few
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
emails over the last few days
 
06:37:16.708 --> 06:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of emails as a matter
 
06:37:17.670 --> 06:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
of fact
 
06:37:19.510 --> 06:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
and they don't get on the list so i'm
 
06:37:21.670 --> 06:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
even wondering how valid
 
06:37:23.590 --> 06:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
the people have bothered to sign in or
 
06:37:26.310 --> 06:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
what we're still getting a very
 
06:37:29.510 --> 06:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
small portion of the public's
 
06:37:31.190 --> 06:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
06:37:35.270 --> 06:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
in my personal opinion and only that
 
06:37:38.390 --> 06:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
the lists seem to say to me which group
 
06:37:38.400 --> 06:37:39.430 align:start position:0%
the lists seem to say to me which group
is

06:37:39.430 --> 06:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:37:41.910 --> 06:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
the more active to getting out the
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
signatures and may not at all be
 
06:37:43.760 --> 06:37:45.430 align:start position:0%
signatures and may not at all be
representative

06:37:45.430 --> 06:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:37:48.468 --> 06:37:48.478 align:start position:0%
of what one believes or the public
 
06:37:49.990 --> 06:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
believes but
 
06:37:51.590 --> 06:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
those of you who
 
06:37:54.788 --> 06:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
want me to get that information
 
06:37:54.798 --> 06:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
want me to get that information
um

06:37:56.390 --> 06:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:57.590 --> 06:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
i will
 
06:37:59.590 --> 06:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yeah what i what
 
06:38:02.390 --> 06:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
i know is that people ask me frequently
 
06:38:05.350 --> 06:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
constituents ask me how can i
 
06:38:07.750 --> 06:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
how can i participate how can i show my
 
06:38:10.708 --> 06:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
support and i tell them about this and i
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
don't say but nobody will listen nobody
 
06:38:14.150 --> 06:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
will look at it
 
06:38:16.948 --> 06:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
so i just feel that we should look at it
 
06:38:19.830 --> 06:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
and just to give you an example
 
06:38:24.948 --> 06:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 1619 which was the
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
one that we itl
 
06:38:28.868 --> 06:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
you can just look and it says that 10
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
people signed in in support one signed
 
06:38:33.510 --> 06:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
in opposed nobody
 
06:38:36.070 --> 06:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
uploaded any message
 
06:38:38.310 --> 06:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy i'm not volunteering to
 
06:38:39.670 --> 06:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
do it
 
06:38:41.190 --> 06:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
06:38:43.190 --> 06:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
so it's very easy to do it's certainly
 
06:38:45.030 --> 06:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
not a headache right no
 
06:38:47.590 --> 06:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
it it could get a little crazy if you
 
06:38:49.910 --> 06:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
also want me to add up all the emails
 
06:38:52.390 --> 06:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
pro and con as well okay
 
06:38:54.070 --> 06:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:38:55.510 --> 06:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would be cruel and unusual
 
06:38:58.868 --> 06:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
punishment then you would get a migraine
 
06:38:58.878 --> 06:39:01.590 align:start position:0%
punishment then you would get a migraine
yeah

06:39:01.590 --> 06:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent did i call you i picked
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
anything to say over there no good
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
06:39:09.910 --> 06:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:39:11.190 --> 06:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing everybody's
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
attention to that i did go through all
 
06:39:15.350 --> 06:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we had open over the
 
06:39:17.190 --> 06:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
weekend and it is really interesting to
 
06:39:19.750 --> 06:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
see some people uploaded manuals for
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
sporting equipment to have an attachment
 
06:39:25.510 --> 06:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
but it's it's nice to see it's a really
 
06:39:27.190 --> 06:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
good thing to review and i think it's
 
06:39:28.868 --> 06:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
the sort of thing that it's good for us
 
06:39:31.110 --> 06:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
to review before coming into session
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
we'll end up knowing what the count is
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards if we're able to balance
 
06:39:36.150 --> 06:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
between the in-person sign-ins and that
 
06:39:38.070 --> 06:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
so that both are reflected but that's
 
06:39:39.350 --> 06:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
something we should all be looking at
 
06:39:42.310 --> 06:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
before we come in just like our emails
 
06:39:46.070 --> 06:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
and those close at the end of the day
 
06:39:47.590 --> 06:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
of the hearing
 
06:39:49.590 --> 06:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
so you can go on and
 
06:39:51.990 --> 06:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
and read them and look at them
 
06:39:52.000 --> 06:39:59.590 align:start position:0%
and read them and look at them
also

06:39:59.590 --> 06:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:01.430 --> 06:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
what is it a heavy percentage of the
 
06:40:03.830 --> 06:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
emails that come in and say i support
 
06:40:06.150 --> 06:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
1619 i support
 
06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know we have hundreds of bills and i
 
06:40:10.708 --> 06:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
don't know which each number thank you
 
06:40:13.430 --> 06:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
for that and you know so it becomes
 
06:40:13.440 --> 06:40:24.948 align:start position:0%
for that and you know so it becomes
meaningless

06:40:24.948 --> 06:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:27.190 --> 06:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably not yeah some committees yes
 
06:40:28.868 --> 06:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
some committees no representative
 
06:40:28.878 --> 06:40:29.830 align:start position:0%
some committees no representative
cushman

06:40:29.830 --> 06:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
06:40:32.628 --> 06:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
so to make it easier for me to keep
 
06:40:35.270 --> 06:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
track of what's what i just like
 
06:40:37.830 --> 06:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
make a folder for each bill
 
06:40:41.590 --> 06:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
and then i just move the emails
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes they address more than one
 
06:40:46.628 --> 06:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
every email uh yeah early
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
i'm behind right now but i yeah all of
 
06:40:51.670 --> 06:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
last year's survival i want to invest
 
06:40:53.590 --> 06:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:40:55.830 --> 06:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
today i had a chance to ask the speaker
 
06:40:58.150 --> 06:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
he was kind of trapped standing in line
 
06:40:59.830 --> 06:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
to get his food
 
06:41:01.750 --> 06:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so i asked him
 
06:41:05.990 --> 06:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh what why the policy that the capture
 
06:41:08.548 --> 06:41:08.558 align:start position:0%
is only till midnight you know the day
 
06:41:11.270 --> 06:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the minute before midnight of the day
 
06:41:13.830 --> 06:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the hearing and a lot of times i
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
certainly don't hear about the bills
 
06:41:17.910 --> 06:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
until afterwards
 
06:41:19.990 --> 06:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh other people's bills
 
06:41:22.628 --> 06:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
and so that would be the most
 
06:41:25.110 --> 06:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
efficient way to get counts and be able
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
to see them all in one place and we can
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
certainly tell the people who email us
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh please use that
 
06:41:34.390 --> 06:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
that that method
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i am going to go ask he told me that
 
06:41:37.280 --> 06:41:38.310 align:start position:0%
but i am going to go ask he told me that
uh

06:41:38.310 --> 06:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:41:40.628 --> 06:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
that the right person to be to ask if
 
06:41:44.390 --> 06:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
that could be extended past midnight
 
06:41:47.350 --> 06:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
would be to talk to aaron about it
 
06:41:49.830 --> 06:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i would like that would mean i could
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
participate more too
 
06:41:53.590 --> 06:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
never feed them after midnight
 
06:41:55.750 --> 06:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:41:58.468 --> 06:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
i came across a cute a cute clip it's
 
06:42:00.868 --> 06:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
about 15 seconds long i'll send it to
 
06:42:02.468 --> 06:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
everyone but you can hear before i get
 
06:42:02.478 --> 06:42:25.690 align:start position:0%
everyone but you can hear before i get
started

06:42:25.690 --> 06:42:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:25.700 --> 06:42:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

06:42:28.310 --> 06:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:42:30.868 --> 06:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
yeah when the spotlight's on
 
06:42:33.590 --> 06:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
just a nudge folks we got four bills uh
 
06:42:33.600 --> 06:42:58.310 align:start position:0%
just a nudge folks we got four bills uh
executed

06:42:58.310 --> 06:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:00.788 --> 06:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
certainly not this committee no
 
06:43:03.350 --> 06:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
um we could have exact more
 
06:43:03.360 --> 06:43:04.310 align:start position:0%
um we could have exact more
bills

06:43:04.310 --> 06:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:43:05.670 --> 06:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
everybody but
 
06:43:08.310 --> 06:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're waiting on um possible amendments
 
06:43:09.670 --> 06:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
06:43:11.190 --> 06:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:43:12.468 --> 06:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we're gonna have
 
06:43:14.468 --> 06:43:14.478 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i know we've got four bills
 
06:43:15.830 --> 06:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're controversial they're going to
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
last a long time and we're going to be
 
06:43:20.708 --> 06:43:20.718 align:start position:0%

nothing do we know
 
06:43:53.910 --> 06:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:07.590 --> 06:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:12.070 --> 06:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
and we still plan on meeting on the 14th
 
06:44:15.990 --> 06:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
and 15th we've got a pile of work to do
 
06:44:16.000 --> 06:44:16.948 align:start position:0%
and 15th we've got a pile of work to do
so

06:44:16.948 --> 06:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:18.948 --> 06:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
06:44:21.590 --> 06:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
may i ask you a question just uh
 
06:44:23.590 --> 06:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of our because i don't think
 
06:44:25.030 --> 06:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
you've said it yet for the seventh and
 
06:44:26.150 --> 06:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
the eighth
 
06:44:27.430 --> 06:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
because we have to get everything out by
 
06:44:28.708 --> 06:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
the eighth
 
06:44:31.110 --> 06:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
um and we still have
 
06:44:32.788 --> 06:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
you know some sec two committee bills we
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
gotta get done and i think there's even
 
06:44:35.750 --> 06:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
a couple haven't been scheduled for
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
hearing yet is that correct
 
06:44:42.628 --> 06:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
not the early ones not early ones
 
06:44:44.708 --> 06:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
i think all the early ones have been
 
06:44:46.310 --> 06:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled okay i thought i saw a couple
 
06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
of ones with fiscal notes that hadn't
 
06:44:49.990 --> 06:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
been that's right i would just
 
06:44:51.590 --> 06:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
say because we don't want it unless
 
06:44:52.868 --> 06:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring our sleeping bags i
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
was curious if we should try to devote
 
06:44:57.750 --> 06:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
both of those days to executive session
 
06:44:59.990 --> 06:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
rather than doing any hearings on those
 
06:45:01.830 --> 06:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
days because we have a lot of big bills
 
06:45:03.510 --> 06:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
that may take a while oh sorry we only
 
06:45:04.708 --> 06:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
have two second two committee bills
 
06:45:07.590 --> 06:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
though my apologies and we've got a
 
06:45:09.590 --> 06:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
couple of them knocked off it's us jerry
 
06:45:11.830 --> 06:45:11.840 align:start position:0%

06:45:24.628 --> 06:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:40.070 --> 06:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
