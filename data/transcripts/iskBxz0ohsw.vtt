TRV okay
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
now need to explain what's going to
 
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
happen with these executing bills
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
when we scheduled today's hearings uh I
 
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
also wanted to get some of our executing
 
00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
out of the way because we have uh
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
including today's bills about 26 left a
 
00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 align:start position:0%
little under 26 that we have to exec um
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
within the next couple weeks so what I
 
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was to be able to exact
 
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
bills in between uh the hearings when we
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
had time so I made that
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
um request when we uh sent in the public
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
hearing and EXA session uh request I was
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
told well you need a starting time for
 
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
the for the exec sessions and I said
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's fine as long as we can still
 
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
exact yep that's all fine all right well
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago after discussion on a
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
slightly related subject this the clerk
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
house clerk who was happened to be over
 
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.029 align:start position:0%
house clerk who was happened to be over
here

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
said it says that you're doing them all
 
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
at 945 I goes no that's not what we were
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
doing and he goes well that's what it
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
says he I said I want to do it in
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
between bills time permitting as we had
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
planned he goes well the only way to do
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
that and this is how it's going to go is
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to have probably a series of
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
rolling um extensions on those bills
 
00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 align:start position:0%

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware does anybody on the
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
committee have questions as to what
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
do I apologize I was told we could do it
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%

until a specific time and that time will
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
probably change several times throughout
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%

representing the town of Amherst um I'm
 
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
also a member of the district Committee
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
of the solid souan solid the San
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
Regional Solid Waste District uh which
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
is a solid waste District formed under
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh eight uh RSA
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
53b um and I'm here to introduce uh 118
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
HB 1181 which is an administ tra of
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
update to uh RSA 53b uh there are three
 
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
updates contained in this bill and I'll
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
go through each one and how we arrived
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
at it um the issues that we came up with
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to be quick because I know
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
you have a busy morning um the first
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
change has to do with
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
um how the the land the the transfer
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
stations within our district handle
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste right now we can accept
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
waste from anybody within our district
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
or outside the district
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
um but what if we have entities that
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
have so much trash or material that we
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
can't accept it at the transfer stations
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh like a school district um the mher
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
school district has a couple of of
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
compactors that are too big to fit you
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
know by the time they they dump out our
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
transfer station they filled up our
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
containers so it doesn't make sense for
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
them to come in so what we wanted to do
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
was allow them to go to our contracted
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
incinerator under our contract price
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
because right now they're paying over
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
$155 a ton where we pay
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
90 so uh it doesn't make sense that a
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
another political subdivision within our
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
own district has to pay such a different
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
different rate uh most communities would
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
service their their schools and you know
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
charge the the district uh accordingly
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
um with this update Services may be
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
contracted through third parties for
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
public entities and political
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions including school districts
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
in order for them to go to directly to
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
the incinerator under the srld contract
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
there was some question whether we
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
already had the authority to do that
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
under this section but this just
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
clarifies it and and specifically says
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's possible to do that um
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
without opening it up to um a lot of a
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
lot of potential problems um the next
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
section that we're making an update to
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
is school boards and
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities um
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to pay the bills uh
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
are allowed
 
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.750 align:start position:0%
are allowed
to

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
um they're allowed to designate a couple
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
of members of their Committees of their
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
boards to sign off on on the invoices
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
through a manifest process and then
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's a mon there's a um a treasur
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
report that comes out every meeting and
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
they uh report all the bills that were
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
paid during the month with the at the
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
srld and most waste management districts
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
we can't do that we don't have that
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
section under the law um so this just
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
adds the same language that is governing
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh school districts and
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities um it gives the treasurer
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the authority to uh to pay the bills
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
and by a non-c contemporaneously signed
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
manifest signed by two or more members
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the of the district committee
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
empowered by District committee as a
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
whole to authorize payments part of the
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
reason for this is that as a governing
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
body we don't have to meet every month
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
so if we don't meet we can't pay the
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
bills which could be a big problem for
 
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
some of our vendors some of our bills
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
are tens of thousands of dollars which
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
could be a financial hardship if some of
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
our entities don't get
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
paid the last
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
update came up in 2022 as as a result of
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
covid um one of the we had a bunch of
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
unanticipated expenses that almost made
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
us go above our budgeted um
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures fortunately we were able to
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
to cancel a large purchase order which
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
put us in the black for the year so we
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
didn't have any problems but it occurred
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
to us that our only real recourse was to
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
go back to our member communities and
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
and ask for more money which they don't
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
have to they can say no in which case we
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
would have been in default on several of
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
our bills and some of our bills can be
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
pretty big so that could put us in a lot
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
of financial
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
trouble um municipalities and school
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
districts can go back to the Department
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration or to the to
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education for
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
permission to SP overspend their budgets
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
but the the uh waste management
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
districts cannot so this takes that
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
language from those um from those
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
sections of the law and extends it to
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
waste management districts um of course
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have to ex we have to exhaust all our
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
administrative options we have to go to
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
the m the municipalities and ask for
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
more money and they have at least one of
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
them has to say no um before we can go
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
to the Dr and get permission to
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
overspend our budgets and of course we
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
have to have the money somewhere we have
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
to have a reserve somewhere that um we
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
can we can use um in this section
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
however uh of course it's the first time
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
I've looked at it since it was drafted
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
and find a mistake right away um where
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
it says in line 26 section one where it
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
says Board of Selectmen of the member
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
member communities it should say uh
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
governing bodies of the member
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
a uh an amendment drawn up for that if
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's okay with the
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee but other than that I think
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
those are the three sections that we're
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
concerned with right now and i' be happy
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
Kella um thank you uh thank you for
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
taking the question um I'm a little
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about um the language on line
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
four where it says um Services may be
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
contract ed through third parties for
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
public entities
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
um in your description it seemed like uh
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
you were trying to allow a municipality
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
to essentially have a
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
combined um contract with including them
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
in another essentially govern
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh body a state body third party seems
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
like you're opening it up to you know
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
501c3 that that is Contracting and then
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
anyone can join that 501c3 and they can
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
contract and so it seems like very vague
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
about where's third parties who is the
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
third parties that are allowed to
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
contract and who like how are they
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
getting empowered to contract in on
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of other
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
people um right because I'm a third
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
party can I contract right and so that's
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
kind of my question and my concern um
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that yeah uh this is
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
Services may be contracted through third
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
parties uh these are services that are
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
provided to the transport station which
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
may be material recycling services they
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
may be Disposal Services uh hauling
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
Services Transportation where they pick
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
up the trash and take it someplace else
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
and this is consistent with the state
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
policy that we see um State the state
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
allows 501 c3s and politic subdivisions
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
within the state to use um State
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
negotiated contracts so this kind of
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
extends it at the local level where if
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
our uh waste district has a contract for
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
services through a third party that also
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
those political subdivisions within that
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
District um are allowed to use that the
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
the the terms of that contract for their
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
own purposes uh which would be build
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
probably through the the Waste
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
Management District and in that case we
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
Bill back the The Entity and with any
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
necessary follow up thank you
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
um uh so in the example the town has uh
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
an agreement with these third parties
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
right it's not the third party agreeing
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
it's the actual Town agreeing and then
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
the school district also wants to use
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
that and you're saying that re urement
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
shall be made by mutual agreement within
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
the district that's assuming that that
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
the agreement has already been in place
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
um and would such an agreement go
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
voters um of the you know the
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
legislative body be able to uh vote so
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
each um you know the school district and
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
the the um the town in this example
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
would each have to agree to such a
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
contract before that would be um
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
enforcable or or that you would be able
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
to um do these Services through kind of
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
a mutual thing or if someone um because
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying like you know the if the
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
town signs the contract and they didn't
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
have the agreement or someone wants to
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
back out of the agreement who's going to
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
be left holding the bill it might be the
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
person that actually signed on the
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
dotted dotted line right thank you for
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
the question um u m Municipal Solid
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
Waste districts are uh they're their own
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
political subdivision they're like a
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
school district they have their own
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
their own authority uh to contract with
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
anyone they they see fit um so they like
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
right now the srld has contracts with
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
the um the incinerator here in conquer
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
and if the school came to us and said
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
you get a better rate than we do can
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
we use your contract at can we can we
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
have our material Hall to the
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
incinerator and conquered and say it's
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
the you know School District under the
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
Sal the souan regional uh landfill
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
District we could say yes but we but we
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
would have to come up with an agreement
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
with them uh it's going to cost us $90 a
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
ton but we have to pay our clerk to bill
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
you back for that so we would add a $10
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
a ton administrative fee or a $10 per
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
time administrative fee so that's all
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is saying we have we already have
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
the contracts in place they want to take
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
it Vantage of them so we would allow
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
accordingly excuse me representa
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and apologies
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
for my tardiness to the meeting this
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
question um I'm looking at the whole
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
whole of RSA
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
53 which is about
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
mutually joining municipalities Jo
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
joining together to provide services it
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
has nothing nothing to do with
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
Contracting with private entities uh and
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
includes all kinds of permissions and
 
00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
notifications that must be given to the
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
state before municipalities can join
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
together in such agreements and and I'm
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
a little concerned that that this
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't refer back to that in some way
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
so so that it's given the proper
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
Authority by the state as dictated in
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
53a yeah the in
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
53b the uh those waste districts are
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
given explicit authority to make to to
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
under to um engage in contracts with
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
third parties um so that is already well
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
established U the srld that I belong to
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
the solid San Regional Landfill district
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
has been in existence since
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
1975 and uh
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
so uh our our primary purpose is to to
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
have contracts with third parties for
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste
 
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.390 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste
Services

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't know that there's a
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
section are there any other questions
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
carry so just a clarification on process
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds as if the way the process
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
would work would be you would your Solid
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
Waste Management District would serve as
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
the Fiscal Agent for the other Municipal
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
entity which might want to join with you
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
on Services right so essentially you'd
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a memorandum of understanding and
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
you would act as the Fiscal Agent in
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
this process right we thank you for your
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
question we would be the uh yeah the the
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
go between uh they would use our
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
contracts it would be built to us as the
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
San Regional Landfill district and then
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
it would be noted like we we do with our
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
towns all our every time we go to the
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
the incinerator you know if it's Hollis
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
or uh Mont Vernon they go to the
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
incinerator solid San Regional Landfield
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
District Mont Vernon and that's where
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
the bill comes in it gets Bill to the
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
Sal to the San Regional Landfill
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
district and in the notes it says mon
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
Veron so it would instead say you know
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
if we had a um a sewer district or a
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
water district that wanted to take
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of it in the in the town it
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
would say you know
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
srld water district or srld um San
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
Regional Sagan corporate school board or
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know something like that amorist or
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
pooll Brook line or whoever was a part
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
of it and this would be limited to just
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
other political subdivisions not every
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
entity in the in the district you
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't go in as a you
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
know a restaurant and say we're with
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
srld that wouldn't it You' have to be a
 
00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
srld that wouldn't it You' have to be a
political

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision further
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions seean I have just you have
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
another one represent
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
no uh I have one for you uh
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh looking at line
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
21 um this is an entirely new section
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
and the title of excuse me the title of
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
the the section is emergency
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures and overe
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
expenditures when you continue on that
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
line it says when an unusual circum an
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
arise could you tell me what the intent
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the word unusual is is
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
that I'll let you talk to it what do you
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
mean by unusual yeah I think this this
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
was taken out of the uh the language
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
that exists for municipalities um
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstances has to be
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
something that you didn't anticipate
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
because you would have you should have
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
budget for it if it's something you
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
should have you should have known about
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
so it asked me an unusual circumstance
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
like I said what how we arrived at this
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
this was during was just after covid in
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
2022 when things were still kind of
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
crazy and um the incinerators were the
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
incinerator wasn't able to handle the
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
volumes that we we had to bring in and
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of wait times and we were
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of charges back from our
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
hauling service and things were were
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
running tens of thousands of dollars
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
over budget so um we realized that if we
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
went over budget we had no no way of of
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
without being in default unless we could
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
get our communities to agree to pay more
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
money and if even one of them said no we
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
we would have been in big
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
trouble okay I'll give myself a followup
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
before I go to representative yella um
 
00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:45.950 align:start position:0%
before I go to representative yella um
it

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
it would it be
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
better I mean to me overe expenditure
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
and I I know you said you grabbed this
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
from other language but where it says uh
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
overe expenditure is an unusual I mean
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
if to to me what you're looking for is
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
really emergency situations I think
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
unusual and
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
over maybe a little too
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
broad um there is a provision if it's an
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
emergency situation we can go directly
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
to the Dr without having to fulfill any
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
of the other criteria um I think unusual
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
um is like a step back from emergency
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's not something that um you
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
could have anticipated but it's not
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
something that is exactly an emergency
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
there there should be a you have time to
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
go through a process um it's it's not
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
like it's a you know time there's any
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
time constraints you you have time to go
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
through the process that that is laid
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
y thank you um thank you for taking
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
another question um regarding these
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
contracts s um with these incinerators
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
or or any disposal type of um contract
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
ha have you reached out um to those
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
people or how does it um to see if they
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
would be okay because I assume that
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
their contract let's say they gave you
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
at a certain time and they you know said
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
it was 90 9 $ a ton or whatever and then
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
now they're Contracting for $120 a ton
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
and and someone doesn't really like that
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so they're they're like hey um we're
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to try and go with this other
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
contract that was $90 a ton um kind of
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
undercutting them trying to raise prices
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
and saying like hey the the facts on the
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
ground are X and we need to be able to
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
recoup some of our actual expenditures
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm a little bit concerned that
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
you may be kind of shooting yourself in
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
the foot if if if the the company you
 
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
know um is put in a situation where they
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate you know this massive
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
volume coming from this one one vendor
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
that they gave a screaming good deal to
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then it turns out to be the entire
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
State because they uh because of this
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
kind of loophole have you talked to them
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
and their concerns about that and no
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's definitely been that was
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns when drafting this
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to keep it limited to uh
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
just small entities within the district
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
um that could that could take advantage
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
of those contracts because uh and I
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
would fully expect that if a school
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
district had a contract with with a um a
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
disposal site disposal facility that
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
required them to use that facility under
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
that contract that they would honor that
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
because they would be in breach it's you
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
know that's you know you you're right
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
you would get volume discounts and if
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
you would be undercutting the the uh the
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
contract in that case and I I would
 
00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
expect that you know any entity that
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
entered into a contract like that would
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
honor it and uh you know I think we
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
would uh if the incinerator called us
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
and said hey you're the school's trying
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
to dump under your contract but they
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
have a contract with us and they're
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
required to bring all of their material
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
to us we we would you know of course
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
honor that if that's is that that's your
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
point followup yeah thank you I I was
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
not trying to to say hey they have a
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
contract that says bring all your waste
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
there I was saying I was I was implying
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
that maybe the contract they're going up
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
for Renewal and they they're getting
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
offered now
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
$120 and they're like wait a minute this
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
other place still has 90 for another
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
three years or whatever we're just going
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
to out we're just not going to sign a
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
new contract and we'll we'll join in
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
with this other group that still has 90
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
for another three years or something
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
like that that was not in breach of
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
their actual contract that's what not
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
trying to apply totally understand I
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your point um yeah uh
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the the business of the
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
srl of the solid waste district is to
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
have that economy of scale to an extent
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
and they can contract with us for the
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
service according to this so we wouldn't
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily be undercutting the you know
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
we're we're just serving our purpose for
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
that Community they can already bring
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
their trash to us at that rate but if we
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily we don't have the
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
capacity to to handle the volume that
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
they can bring us they can just bring it
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
directly to this the uh service that
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
we've contracted with that's all this
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
this is is saying so um as far as the
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
communities go that that's kind of the
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of of a solid waste district is
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
to act as that economy a scale and to
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
have to be able to negotiate better
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
contracts um for our our municipalities
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the the political subdivisions
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
districts okay any further comments
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
testimony I had one pink card on this
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill and I had one individual sign on
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
the blue signin sheet neither Pro nor
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
con so with that we will go ahead and
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
1181 thank
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
you our next hearing begins at 10: so we
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
have 5 minutes so I am now going to open
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
up the executive
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
session on all our bills that we are
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to exact we've only got five

minutes so I'm going to take a one that
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
I know is going to be very short
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
and that will be
 
00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:35.350 align:start position:0%
and that will be
HB

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
hb180 relative to the
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
exemption and do I have a motion on
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%

yes uh representative kahill seconds
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
that motion representative Solis would
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
it yes I think we were looking for an
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment on
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
this and uh
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
as far as I know there is no
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be correct um I can
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
give everybody a quick brief here on
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
exactly the status of this um I ended up
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
talking with the attorney
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
who was uh Mary Stewart who was the
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
attorney who handled the C the Supreme
 
00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.039 align:start position:0%
Court case for the
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
state um in our discuss lengthy
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
discussions and emails um
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
my my point to her was that I think the
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
road that the sponsor was going down was
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually muddying the waters making it
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
worse than rather than better and that
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
if you read the actual Supreme Court
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
decision it talks several times in there
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
about ownership that not only do you
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
have to occupy but you have to show
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
ownership I said I think what needed to
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
be done was names need to be on the
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
deeds in order to claim it she goes the
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision the way it's
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
written now without any changes actually
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
does that I said well I think what
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
really needs to be done is maybe a
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying line in the RSA to to so an
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
individual looking at it says okay I'm
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
totally unaware of the Supreme Court
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
decision however I understand that
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
according if I want to claim this
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
Homestead exe exemption the husband and
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
spouse or the the the spouses both have
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
to be named on the
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
deed I brought that to the co-spon uh to
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's attention like I said uh
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative lales said that we were
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
waiting for um a
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
potential amendment to take care of that
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that uh personally I'm
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
fine with the current way the RSA is
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
written I would prefer to see clarifying
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
language in there so
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
everybody understand that the name has
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
to be on the deed to to uh to claim the
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption so I'm I'm fine at
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
this point with an itail i I would
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
suggest that in the maybe somebody uh
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
next session comes forward with an
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
amendment for that do I have any
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
comments representative

Gallagher um yeah one additional thing
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
I'd note was that um we also had another
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
bill uh HB 1034 which was uh relative to
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh also relative to a homestead property
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
tax exemption so um which I believe we
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
referred to interim study so um if the
 
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.389 align:start position:0%
referred to interim study so um if the
prime

00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
prime
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
sponsor would be um interested uh
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps he could uh get involved with
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
that process to um move his own ideas
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
about a Homestead Property exemption
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%

Davis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
for that explanation of the history of
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
the bill I also spoke with the sponsor
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
because I had several concerns about
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
wording uh and one was that it's it's
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
not a right it's an
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
exemption uh and it also talks about the
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
value of the property rather than the
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
appraised value and I requested that
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
those changes be made and the sponsors
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
said that an amendment was forthcoming
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
and as we see no amendment has come so I
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%

Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's new market and new Fields um I
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
have spoken to you all repeatedly in the
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
past over this year and other years
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
um about the severity of the housing
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
crisis um to recap very briefly those
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
points in the past we are in the midst
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
of the worst the worst housing crisis
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
this state has ever seen in history full
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
stop the worst housing crisis um it is
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
also the biggest crisis of any crisis in
 
00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
also the biggest crisis of any crisis in
New

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is driving our already
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
severely aging state
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
driving the young workers from the state
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
in droves because they simply cannot
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
afford to live
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
here in less than 20 years there will
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
not be enough young workers in this
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
state to care for the people in the
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
state who will require residential care
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
that is how bad this is that the people
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
here in this room in 20 years many will
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
have to have residential care and we
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
won't have enough people in the state to
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
literally care for them we have to do
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
something and so before you today I have
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
a very humble study committee to study
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of a potential Loan
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
program to do two things potentially one
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
is to loan to load a moderate income
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
people for a um a home purchase and the
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
other is to consolidate student loans
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
and there is a reason that these two
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
things are
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
connected so for student loans the the
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
reason well I'll start with housing with
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the with the ability to purchase when we
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
talk about dealing with the housing
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
crisis almost all of our proposed
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions revolve around rentals but
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
really home ownership is the gold
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
standard home ownership is far more
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable far better for the economy
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
far better for pretty much every single
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
metric you can come up with than rentals
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
so the goal should be to get as many
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
people who want to be in their own home
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
and into their own
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
home that should be the
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
gold the reason that student loans have
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
something to do with that is that
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
population that wants to buy in New
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because again New Hampshire is
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
a very desirable state in every other
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
way except for housing so it's not that
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
young people don't want to be here it's
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
that they can't afford to be here but
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest source of that young worker
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
population debt that prevents them from
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
so my thought was that if banks can
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
provide loans for mortgages and can
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
provide student debt consolidation loans
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
and can operate at a profit doing that
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
why in the world can't a state do that
 
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
and break even it may require an upfront
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
investment that then over time would get
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
covered by the later um payments on
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
those loans but eventually you could pay
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
back that initial investment and then
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
operate in such a way that the operating
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
costs are
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
covered and this is not a New Concept if
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
you've heard of
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
microloans like um Charities that
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
operate in third world countries they
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
allow people to provide loans to people
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
in those developing countries so that
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
they can get housing start businesses
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
what have you and their repayment rates
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
are through the roof and what it's it's
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the pay it Ford method the
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
pay it Ford Model that instead of that
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
money going back to a profit like it
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
does with a private bank that you can
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
simply take that money cover your costs
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
and invest in the next wave of people
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
who need homes or need their student
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
loans consolidated it's also the the
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
same pay it for method or model that
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
Habitat for Humanity uses the idea that
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
there's an in initial investment where
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
you get people to pay into what they're
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
going to get and then that those
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
I think that in the midst of this
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
terrible crisis and this is something
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's been true historically whenever a
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
country or a state is experiencing a
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
very bad situation usually they have to
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
start thinking outside the box for
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
Solutions and oftentimes they end up on
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
the Forefront of um that particular
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
solution right they come up with
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
something new and Innovative that works
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
and I think New Hampshire has a chance
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
if we study this and we think about it
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a chance we can make this
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
work in a zero eventual cost to the
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
state way where we could reach extremely
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
high levels of home ownership in this
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
state extremely low student debt um
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
burden in this state and that we could
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
be a leader in the entire country for
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
how we do things and really show the way
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
forward so I think considering the
 
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
severity of the
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
crisis that a a lowly study committee at
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
the very least is warranted I don't have
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
all the answers but that's why we have a
 
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
study committee with that I'd like to
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
take questions but I really encourage
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
the committee to just um consider having
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
solution

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.829 align:start position:0%
solution
representative

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr
chairman

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh my first question is have you taken
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
into account first we know that there's
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
a housing crisis going on and but have
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
you taken into account all the housing
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
units that are now currently been
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
approved and are under construction and
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
will be occupied within the next uh 3 to
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and so
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
that question doesn't go to the um kind
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
of merits of the underlying idea but how
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
much of a crisis do you project there
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
will be in the future kind of question
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
and the answer is um essentially yes so
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
even the units that are being built most
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
of them are rentals that's not ideal
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a a Band-Aid on a bullet
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
wound in a lot of cases secondly there's
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
really not a lot not making those
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
rentals affordable we're still we want
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
to believe that the Market's always
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
going to like if you just build enough
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to drive down those prices
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
but we've seen over and over and over
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
again how that has not been the case and
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
that without some way to make developers
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
offer lower income units that they're
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
just going to build to the highest uh
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
paying customer so it it has not proven
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
to solve the crisis yet um and for those
 
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
two reasons it's not affordable it
 
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
hasn't has been affordable in this state
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
to Young workers and also it's not the
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
same thing as owning a home for those
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
two reasons you are actually correct
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
when you said it was off topic um and
 
00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
now we're hearing very off-topic
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
comments for the members of the
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee please ask questions that are
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
directed to establishing a committee for
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
these purpose that way we'll be uh do
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have a quick followup repres follow
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a clarification I because we keep
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
hearing this house in crisis housing
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
crisis and I know from the city of
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester has done a lot and I you know
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that most of them are
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
rental but I just wanted to have that
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
out there the my next question is why
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
are you combining the student
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
consolidation loans into this because
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are two important issues and they
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
should be dealt separately thank you
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I thought I
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
answered that in my testimony but I
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
guess I wasn't clear enough and I do
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
want to go out there I am the last
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
person in the world that should um ever
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
criticize anyone for being emotional
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
about one of these issues um but I do
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
feel like there's some emotion here that
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
I don't understand where it's coming
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
from but to answer the question um I I
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
as I said well I just wait for him to
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
hear the answer as I said in my
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
testimony as the situation currently
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
stands young working people who want to
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
buy a home often times that young
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
working population their highest debt
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
burden comes from student loans and that
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
is a huge barrier for them to purchase a
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
home and that is why considering both
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
student loan consolidations which banks
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
Do privately at a profit and mortgage
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
loans which banks Do privately at a
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
profit are appropriate because if you
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
can imagine a state this state which is
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
beautiful and wonderful in every way
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
except for its housing affordability now
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
having near perfect home ownership rates
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
everyone who wants to own a home can and
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
Incredibly low student debt burden
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's a state that everyone should want
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
to live in very good representative uh
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
do you still have a question
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie uh my question is
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
asked I I felt there was some uh I
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand why you put the
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
student loans in with the housing but uh
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
it has I apologize further questions
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher um so
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear you mention Habitat for
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
Humanity in your testimony for
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
disclosure sake uh my brother works with
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
them out in Portland Oregon um so my
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
question is um
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
under uh Roman 3 starting at line 13 it
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
has the list of um entities that
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be or
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that um they'll be seeking
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
testimony from if this is based on the
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
Habitat for Humanity loan model then why
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
not include them as one of the um
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
entities to seek information from thank
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
you so I I didn't to be very very clear
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't say it's based on the Habitat
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
for Humanity model I said it's based on
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
the pay it Ford model which Habitat for
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
Humanity and or other organizations like
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
microloans also use so it's kind of
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
Divergent um but which means the same
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
but taking different paths um the the
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm glad brought this up because I meant
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
to bring it in my testimony the list of
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
entities that will be solicited is not
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
exclusive so anybody can come and
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
testify in these study committee
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
hearings um but I did put together this
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
list on the basis of um input that I
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
solicited from New Hampshire housing so
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Authority or
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority was very um
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
instructive in including at a bare
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
minimum the organizations that should be
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
solicited for input in the study
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
committee question representative status
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have a working
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
definition of low to moderate income
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
households there are working definitions
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
um this is LMI is a well understood uh
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh term it depends on which governmental
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
entity what exact definition that they
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
use but that would also be part of what
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
the study committee would determine they
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
could determine it's also regionally
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
based for most of those federal agencies
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
they they determine what LMI means in a
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
particular region so that might mean
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
that the study committee decides that a
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh a qualification may be different in
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
Coos than it is in Rockingham but again
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's what would be up to the study
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
committee to determine which of those
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
federal agencies um definitions to
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
follow representative
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you for taking my
 
00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:22.589 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you for taking my
question

00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
um the housing crisis in New Hampshire
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
has existed for a while it's my
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have a a committee
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
established uh a comprehensive committee
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan that's looking into the
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
housing crisis why do we need another
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.069 align:start position:0%
committee to
study

00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
housing um thank you representative and
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
may I just say it's a pleasure being
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
able to see you when you're asking me a
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
question instead of looking across as
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
speaker um I think you might be
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
referencing the special committee on
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
housing which I'm a proud member of um a
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislative committee is different from
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
a study committee so we do study
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
committees on many things because
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
legislative committees can only hear
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
bills they so we are taking an
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
information on bills that have been come
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
up with and put before us we can't study
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
committee or legislative committees
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
can't really write their own bills
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
individuals can individuals from those
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
committees can but the committee itself
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
just hears bills a study committee and
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
there are many study committees studies
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
an issue to come up with proposed
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
legislation so again this would be
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
studying the feasibility and hopefully
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
the committee would put to decide that
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
something is feasible and put together
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
that something in a proposed legislation
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
which then would come to the housing
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
committee um for its hearing so two
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
different roles thank you thank you rep
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you Mr uh uh
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing me to ask another
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
question of course you uh you're
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Southern New
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh work um Southern New
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um SE Coast Workforce housing
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
what's that Sea Coast Workforce housing
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
no no no no um Housing Works that's been
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
in existence for years now and it serves
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
the areas between Manchester and Nashua
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
and they are doing this this exact thing
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
is providing loans for low and moderate
 
00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:33.510 align:start position:0%
is providing loans for low and moderate
income

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
households have you consulted with
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
them uh no but I would I would suggest
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
that they are not covering everyone who
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
needs to be covered every low to
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
moderate income family that wants to
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
purchase a home because we still have
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis anything that's
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
existed for years as you have just said
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
is not producing results because we're
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the situation we're in and um as
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
Aeros Smith once said if you always do
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
what you've always done you'll always
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
get what you always got if we're here in
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
a housing crisis then obviously the
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
things that we've been doing all the
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
different independent um charity works
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
it seeing no further questions thank you
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you Mr chair I
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh did you fill out a pink card by the
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
way thank you for reminding me um I also
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
do not have any other pink cards I have
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
the blue sign in sheet Ben Frost signed
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
in in favor he's from New Hampshire
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
housing with that we will go ahead and
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:19.829 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
okay now we're going to reopen uh the
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
recessed executive session
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
on uh several bills we're going to start
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
right at the top with this one we have
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
about 25 minutes before our next hearing
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
so I think we should be able to maybe
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
get one maybe two out uh but we're going
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
to open up an executive session on HB
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
11124 relative to limiting the conflicts
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
of interest and excess concentration of
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
power Municipal boards and committee
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
members and with that I am going
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
to recognize representative power who
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chairman I would
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%

to House Bill
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
1124 and that would be Amendment
 
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.270 align:start position:0%
1124 and that would be Amendment
2024

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.390 align:start position:0%
2024
d09

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment um thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
um to this particular Bill there was a a
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
series of amendments and changes to the
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill based on um feedback after the
 
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.829 align:start position:0%
bill based on um feedback after the
hearing

00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
so with regards
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
to the latest Amendment which is
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
0979 h i I'll go over what the changes
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
are so first
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
um Town manager or other administrator
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
is removed from the list of roles in
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
subsection 1A and instead addresses that
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
the that role distinctly in a new
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
subsection and it's moved down to uh
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
Section 1
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
D um so as to retain the same
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions as in 1A accept the
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
appointed role of tax collector as
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
authorized by RSA 37 col
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
16 um and that avoids a a conflict and
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
then um all the subsequent subsections
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
are then re renumbered so additionally
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
added to subsection section 1e um a
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
phrase preventing a selectman from
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
serving on an elected Board of assessors
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
that that is um added um to the bill
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
language and a new section two is added
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
um see with regards to applicabil
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
applicability allowing for a
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
transitional implementation by allowing
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
any member holding conflicting positions
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
to remain in those positions until the
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
next election thereby allowing anyone in
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
um such a situation to either to choose
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
to not run again if the term is ending
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
or to resign thereby creating a vacancy
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
that would need to be filled for the
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
balance of the term and then finally and
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
in section three which was previously
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
section two it just changes the
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
effective date to upon
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
passage thank you representative power
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
for the explanation do we have any
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
comments or questions representative
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so yeah just kind of a
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
question for
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
clarification so this since this one um
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
0979 H and we've is and we've got um two
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
separate amendments here I'm assuming
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
that we're doing this one instead of the
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
other one and therefore won't be
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
considering that the other
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
lales thank you Mr chairman um I had a
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
chance to speak with the prime sponsor
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
this morning on on this I feel that this
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh is very much needed uh I talked with
 
00:55:47.319 --> 00:55:48.789 align:start position:0%
uh is very much needed uh I talked with
him

00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
specifically about one possible addition
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
is when you have a
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
a in most cases there you can't be a
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
selectman and hold a full-time position
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
which makes sense because then you're
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
you're bossing yourself but in the case
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
where you have a
 
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.150 align:start position:0%
where you have a
part-time

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
position but as a department
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
head then I don't feel that that person
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
should also be a selectman I spoke with
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
the with Prime sponsor and uh down the
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
road uh with the uh uh other body uh we
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
hope to make that uh addition but I
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
think this is very much needed that's an
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
excellent point I was going to make that
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
point that if there are other potential
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
inclusions like you suggest once it goes
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the other other side of the wall then
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
that'd be a great place for it
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh have representative
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
Elward first yes I just have a question
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
about one uh K lowercase
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
k it says no full-time Municipal
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
Employee or department head Shall Serve
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
on any budget or Finance board or
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
Committee of the same
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
municipality does or committee mean any
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:29.230 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
I will let representative power read
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
you based on my reading of of of that um
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
section K it would be um a
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee because it says budget or
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
Finance board would be one noun or
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
committee would be a second
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
entity follow up Mr chairman go ahead
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you uh Mr Speaker I guess
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
probably I'm the odd man out because my
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
first question was why do we need this
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe it's a difference of of
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
towns and where you're living but uh I I
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
reason given as yet to me why we would
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
have such a comprehensive Bill covering
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
what the town officials can do uh I
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't raise the question as to uh the
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
selectman not being on the board of
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
assessors I thought they were the
 
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
assessors they are in my town uh we have
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
a we
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh have that work uh farmed out but we
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
are still the
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
assesses and I think that's I don't know
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
the chapter and verse but I think the
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
selectman being assesses is a a matter
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
of Law and uh I I feel very
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable uh when you tell me that I
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
can't serve on the board of selectman
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
and the school
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee I think they
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh in some towns that's a good thing I
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
don't see any conflict there uh I think
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
that uh uh there should be a real close
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
relationship particularly when the
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
School departments spending all the
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
money uh and you ought to have as uh as
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
close an association as you can and
 
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
that's to have at least uh one member on
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
the school committee so Mr chairman I I
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see any reason for this bill uh
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I haven't heard any answers as to
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
particularly whether or not the board of
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
assessors uh cannot be the selectman
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power thank you
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I'm able to answer that um
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry by represent the representative
 
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.150 align:start position:0%
inquiry by represent the representative
so

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
um in some
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities um the the assessors are
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
elected and that's referred to as the
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
board of assessors in municipalities
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
where that those positions are not
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
elected you are correct in fact correct
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen function in that role as
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
the assessors so what this um Amendment
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is to
 
01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.150 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is to
um

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
prevent an individual from being elected
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
to both the select board as well as the
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
board of accessors at the same
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
time follow up Mr chairman just quickly
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
on the on the answer sorry I'll get
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
right back to
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
though thank you Mr chairman I like I
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
like this bill I think that it um goes a
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
long way to prevent concentrations of
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
power especially in small towns if
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
concern that there won't be enough
 
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
people to fill these roles I don't think
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
that is a valid concern I think that
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
this might actually help with that uh
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard that concern before because
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
I think more people more likely to be
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
come involved if some people aren't
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
running everything in the
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
towns represent
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
Guth thank you and thank you for your uh
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer uh regarding the board of
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
assessors but is it clear that the board
 
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.470 align:start position:0%
assessors but is it clear that the board
of

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
assessors in in this case is
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
elected and the the fact is the Bo of
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
represent P thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
happy to respond to that so I am
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
confident that the language is is sound
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor as as well as
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
myself I I pointed that out for
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
consideration for because that
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
distinction might not have been um
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
realized by the prime sponsor when the
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
bill was drafted and furthermore this
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
language was um vetted and analyzed by
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
the new Hamp the attorney from the New
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association as well
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
as OS so I am confident that that that's
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and proper language again
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam repres
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um I
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
also like this bill and intend to vote
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
in support of it uh I started out be
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
being very much opposed to it uh on a
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
theoretical level but it's actually
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
happening in my municipal it now and
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a very good feeling uh and so
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
in in hindsight and upon further reading
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
and and I'm grateful to have the amend
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment which improves the bill um I
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
do support this Bill thank you repres
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
represent kahill thank you Mr chair um
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to Echo my colleagues um
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment goes a long way to
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
strengthening this bill this is um one
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
of the better amendments I've seen out
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
of our committee and this is a good bill
 
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
and I will be supporting it
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
rep representative
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
howand so I actually served six years on
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the school board and the Town Council at
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
the same time um I I would not recommend
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
doing it by the way it's a lot of work
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
um um but I think the distinction that I
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
had was that I in the school board I was
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
in a Cooperative district and so uh
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
there was a um a uh the voters of of the
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
entire Cooperative were voting on the
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
budget I didn't have the power like I
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
did and the on the Town Council where I
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
was approving the budget they were
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
separated and so in that case there was
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
a safeguard that allowed it that said um
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's really I mean there
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
was some benefit that when I was on the
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
school board and the Town Council that
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
we did a bunch of Cooperative things
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
together uh there was a large summer
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
program that served our students uh
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
there was when we built the Middle
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
School changing roads and things we work
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
together to try to save uh save money
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
but overall I I just don't think it's a
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
really good idea I think you need
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
different voices on those two separate
 
01:04:35.599 --> 01:04:36.430 align:start position:0%
different voices on those two separate
uh

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
setups further comments representa P
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll take this
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the underlying
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
Bill seeing that the amendment is the
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill so this bill is a common sense bill
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
that limits conflicts of interests in
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
positions of local government duties and
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
responsib posibilities of certain
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal municipal offices are such
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
that when an individual holds two of
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
these offices or they might be an office
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
holder and also be an employee of the
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
municipality at the same time there can
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
be actual conflicts of interest or the
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
appearance of of such so this bill is
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward um the amendment is is
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
is a an improvement over the bill as
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
introduced the Bill's logical and
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
importantly it provides checks and
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
balances in order to protect the people
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
who are governed by these office
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
holders for the
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
comments representative car I do have a
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
question regarding k um and the
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
committee issue so with a technical
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
Review Committee that's usually made up
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
of department heads how would this
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
conflict

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
could you could you ask that again
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
please just make sure everybody heard it
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
so okay line 31 um or 32 actually it
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
talks about committees just generally
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
speaking committees
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
non-specific technical review committees
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
which advise planning boards uh at the
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
municipal level are usually made up of
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
department heads so how would this
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
Committee we have somebody who believes
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
he can answer represent kahill I had
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
this same question because multiple
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
department heads in my town sit on our
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
TRC committee but if you if we read this
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
s read and I had to read this a ton of
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
times here no full-time Municipal
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
Employee or department head Shall Serve
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
on any Budget Finance board or Committee
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the it is talking about budget and
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
finance this sentence is if you just
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
circle those two two words it's not
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
talking about a TRC committee it's
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about budget my
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
ores I I will agree that maybe that last
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
line could have been drafted slightly
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
better but it is what it is for now um
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions I'll just
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
kind of reiterate what uh representative
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
power said um I think on policy-wise
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is really an excellent Bill she
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that rep uh n Grace from
 
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal um worked very closely with
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative spills spillsbury to get
 
01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
this thing uh the bill the what's in
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
front of you finalized I believe it's a
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
really good work it is it does provide
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
checks of balances
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
and also along the lines of the
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
separation of power so I'm fully in
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
support further comments
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we'll ask the

executive session bills which we have
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
two remaining uh we will just throw a
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
time on that of let's say U 11:00 just
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
to be safe and with that we we will
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
two and in 4 minutes we will open up the

next uh house session while we have
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
everybody here um or almost everybody
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
here issue on our the rest of our
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions um hopefully did you
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
get okay um we are going to have after
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
today roughly a little under 20 bills
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
left to
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
exact the problem that we're running
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
into to explain this to uh
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative stavis majori and power
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
this morning I've been going over it for
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
the last week and I trying to find a
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
solution originally we had talked last
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
time we met of either next Monday or
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
next Friday holding an exec session um
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
the problem with Friday is if we do them
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
on Friday the committee reports aren't
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
in and then all those 20 bills are going
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
to end up on the very
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
final house session and it's just going
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be too many there's going to be some
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be debating and and
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
excessive so the options that I threw
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
out and uh we you can talk amongst
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
yourselves representative stavis and and
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
I will talk to our side and she can talk
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
to your side but we're going to have to
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
do something next Monday unfortunately
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay so the the question then becomes
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
and and the other reason I want to get
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
this done next week is any exact bills
 
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
that might
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
need to be extended for amendments or
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
whatever that gives us the 20th which is
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
a Wednesday in the morning to get those
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
done and the committee reports done
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
immediately then into the calendar
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
because that's our last day that's it so
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're going to have to do
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
something next Monday
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned to representative the the
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
representatives I mentioned before that
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
we can either uh do a halfday morning
 
01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
half day afternoon and get done as much
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
as we can or we can just do just list
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
them all and and go for it I that's my
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
preference but we will talk amongst
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves talk with you all and then
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're going to do but we
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
are going to have to do something next
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
Monday okay uh one minute and we'll
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%

to talk about hb1 1460 which is a bill
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
which spells out the process by which a
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
county must F must follow in either
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
selling or Leasing county-owned Property
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I want to talk about the impetus for
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
this bill which involved a historic
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
building in Carol County it was our
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
historic Courthouse it's a beautiful
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
building um it had an assessed tax value
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
of approximately
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
$22,000 it is almost $1,000 Square ft
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
and it sits on 2.6 acres in oopy um our
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners decided to sell the
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
building due to the cost of Maintenance
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
and to put it up for sale um the
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
director of our maintenance Carol County
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance stated that the building was
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
in impressively good shape and two
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations expressed
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
interest in the property one was a
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
charter school another was an affordable
 
01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
charter school another was an affordable
housing

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
organization um the charter the
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing organization said if
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
the charter school wants to purchase it
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to back out so the charter
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
school ought ultimately bought the
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
$1 now there were voters in our County
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
who felt that they would have liked more
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
notice about the impending sale there
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
was there was an article in the paper um
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
it it was notice but people felt they
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
wanted an opportunity to provide public
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
feedback about the sale of the property
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
and they thought that there should have
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
been more public discussion regarding
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
the use of a building the building for a
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
sober living facility affordable housing
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
or other non for-profit activities and
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
most importantly the citizens many I
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say the citizens many citizens
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
in Carol County felt that an asset of
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
theirs was sold that squandered their
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars by selling it for a
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
dollar rather than closer to what it was
 
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.830 align:start position:0%
dollar rather than closer to what it was
worth

01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
um now the current SC in this bill the
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
current statute was amended to state
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
that the County Commissioners can make a
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
sale or lease of County property with a
 
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
competitive B bidding process followed
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
by a two-thirds vote of the delegation
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
and by the executive committee the
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
property can be listed with a realtor
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
but not required and or the property May
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
be transferred to a development uh
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
Authority uh 15 days notice to the
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
public would be required and the public
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
must be given an opportunity to actively
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the bidding for such
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
property I'm not going to go through all
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
the details but I think one of the Crux
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the bills is a requirement for an
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
qualified appraiser to conduct an
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
appraisal of a bill of the building and
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
what are the reasons for that one I
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that the
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and citizens know what the
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
fair market value is of a of a property
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
that belongs to them it's a county
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
building and that the public isn't
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
underselling the land um or the building
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
that could deprive the taxpayers of
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
funds um I think it's a way to provide
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
transparency and greater public trust um
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
by using a qualified third party I think
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
that helps do that and so the community
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
can be sure that the sale was conducted
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
fair and above board um a professional
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
valuation also helps um with the
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
negotiations so we know what we're
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with if it's a clear we have a
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
clear idea what the fair price is and
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
the county can avoid being pressured
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
into a low ball Offa offer and it can
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
uncover potential issues like asbesto
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
structural concerns or environmental
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
hazards that will also um be helpful in
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
the um in the selling process and
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
finally it supports the best use
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
determination for the building so um
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
I'll end there um I will end there with
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
that and see if if people have questions
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%

you for taking my question on um line
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
10 Roman
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
1 it gives a adequate notice of a
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
minimum of 15 days to the public of such
 
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.750 align:start position:0%
minimum of 15 days to the public of such
a

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
sale and the public shall be given the
 
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
opport opportunity to actively
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
participate in the bidding of such
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
property do you believe that 15 days is
 
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.350 align:start position:0%
property do you believe that 15 days is
adequate

01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
notice I personally would like it to see
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
see it be 30 days um I I I think the you
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
know I I think that buying a bill a
 
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
property of this size is a big deal for
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit they need to know what
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
they're getting into so yeah I would
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
prefer to see 30 days to be honest with
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Yella
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
hi thank you um in the example uh that
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
you just gave
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
um it seems
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
like you may have glossed over a point
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
that is currently in statute that the
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the County Convention had to vote
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
to ratify that sale of it for $1 so
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
are so if there was concerns by those
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
those County Convention members they
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
could have had the power to make that
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
cell null and void um so how did that
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
vote go was that a close vote and that's
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
why we're trying to move it from
 
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
majority to 2/3 or or was it just
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly we're just going to pass
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
this I actually don't remember the final
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
vote I mean we are you know I in in
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
County to be honest we usually split on
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
party lines so my guess is that it was
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
something like 105 I and I have to go
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
back and check the vote and I'm going to
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
say something very honestly here I think
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
that um several of us were as sleep at
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
the switch when the sale went through
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
and that's on us that was on us not on
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
on um anybody else okay thank
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr uh uh chairman and
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
during this time isn't a a policy that
 
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
when the County Convention is a
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
considering a motion like this to have a
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing be held at that time so
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
and I would not call it a public hearing
 
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
the way that um we operate in Carol
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
County is that before a meet before a
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
meeting people can make public comment
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
um but they cannot ask
 
01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.270 align:start position:0%
um but they cannot ask
questions

01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.430 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.189 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so one of the groups you
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned in describing your uh
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
motivating example was an affordable
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
housing group I'm wondering what sort of
 
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
impact you foresee this legislation
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
having on our current housing
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
crisis I I don't think I can answer that
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
I mean it that would depend I mean in
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
this particular scenario you know was
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
this building appropriate for affordable
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
housing I can't answer that without
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
having the appraisal that I talked about
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
I mean had it been an appropriate
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
building we have a huge affordable
 
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
housing Pro uh problem particularly in
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
that part of the state in oopy um um
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's a sober um there's a sober
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
living um group White Mountain White
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
Mountain I'm losing the the last last
 
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
part of it um and a lot of those people
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
could use housing when they come out of
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
that program I mean we just there's just
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
so many people who need housing so it's
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say how what kind of an
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
impact that would had but it's as you as
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
you saw it's 11,000 ft
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
building so that could have been a lot
 
01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:01.790 align:start position:0%
building so that could have been a lot
of

01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
Apartments again I'm going to remind the
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunity for public
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
comment would you be amenable to adding
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
91a which would somewhat kind of re in
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
that public comment to what is allowable
 
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.390 align:start position:0%
that public comment to what is allowable
under

01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
statute yes I mean again if people you
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
know um you know again we're trying to
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
to make an amendment so that people can
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
do up to three minutes without
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
interruption hoping I guess we have to
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
wait to see if that bill passes but yes
 
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.030 align:start position:0%
wait to see if that bill passes but yes
thank

01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
you further comments or questions
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative power representative
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
priest could you throw off your mic
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
please thank you thank you m thank you
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and um so I'm I'm looking at
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
the the bill language and I'm looking at
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 1 starting on line 10 page
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
first page of the bill and then um Roman
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 and it's not clear to me what
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
the purpose of each section is and uh
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
just it seems to me and and clarify or
 
01:29:45.109 --> 01:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
help me to understand it seems to me
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
potentially the wording uh in Roman
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
numeral 1 is that if there's a property
 
01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:54.390 align:start position:0%
numeral 1 is that if there's a property
that

01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
um is to be sold then there'll be a
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
public notice of just this is for sale
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then in Roman numeral 2 perhaps the
 
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of that section is that when a
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
sale you know a buyer is
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
identified and there's going to be the
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
sale that that will be um noticed is is
 
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:50.109 align:start position:0%
 
test

01:30:50.109 --> 01:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
no turn it back on again and see just
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone or we could talk offline
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that the first
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
section is there's it's like listing a
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
property like this properties for sale
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
and the in Roman numeral 2 that section
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
is we found a this is going to be sold
 
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
to this buyer for this price and that's
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
that purpose of notice of for that
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
section well it it shouldn't be it's
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
going to go to sale it should be that
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's I think the wording would be better
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
if say that there's there's that there's
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
coming to an agreement on a sale they're
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
approaching finality before any papers
 
01:31:43.159 --> 01:31:44.310 align:start position:0%
approaching finality before any papers
are

01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't just
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
on how about okay there we go uh
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
representative power I'll give give you
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
one more quick one I bring that up
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
because representative stavis had um
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
suggested some amendments to to make
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
things simpler
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm I'm a little concerned by
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
deleting one if there's two purposes
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
here in the two Roman numeral sections
 
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
and by removing one you're going to
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
remove a purpose so that's that's all
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to point out thank you so
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
what I'll say is on the sections one and
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
two if maybe that is best handled
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
offline you guys can coordinate what you
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
want to do with that thank you further
 
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.109 align:start position:0%
want to do with that thank you further
questions

01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
Elward thank uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking at Roman uh five M so the
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
Public's going to to be given
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
notice of the acceptance of the winning
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
bid and provided with opportunity for
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
public comment what is the purpose of
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
the public comment how is that going to
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
change anything or have an influence
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
on the acceptance of a winning bid is
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
your question how would public comment
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
change that how would public comment
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
have any purpose oh I think I think it
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
has a huge purpose because um again
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
people in our community were not I mean
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
in this particular case I mean I can
 
01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
just tell you the rationale for it with
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
the charter school they felt it was
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to be um draining students from
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
the public school and weren't sure how
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to impact the public school
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
nearby so they had concerns about
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
selling you know to a charter school and
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
how it was going to impact public
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
education and I think that that those
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
were important points that should have
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
been made
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
public representative Elward F followup
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so would the sale
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
be contingent upon this public comment
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
period I I I don't think public comment
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
ever you know um um what's the word I'm
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
looking for I I I I think it can
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
influence let's put it that way I think
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
it influences if you I mean we've had
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've had instances where different
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
things happening in the in our County in
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
our communities where you have a room
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
full of people an auditorium full of
 
01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
full of people an auditorium full of
people

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that impacts um
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
decision making I
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
do see no more uh represent Mr Clark go
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman uh I'm also
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
a member of the uh C County delegation
 
01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.750 align:start position:0%
a member of the uh C County delegation
and

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh wasn't this generated this bill
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
because of the charter school of being a
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
charter school that went in there that
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
took the took over the building the
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
charter school I don't really understand
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
your question isn't this bill because of
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
a child of
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
school this bill is because of what
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
transpired in the sale of that building
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
which ultimately in this case went to a
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
charter school May I just do a
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
$1 wasn't the uh that building you're
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
mentioning that's on the National
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
Historic list and one of the agreements
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
that that building had remained the same
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
with the historic Courthouse within
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
inside of that and if it had gone to a
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh hotel or whatever you want to call it
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
housing that Courthouse would have been
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed in the historic value related
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
to it would have been gone I I'm not
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure that that is that is
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
how the historical um statute relates to
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
that building okay thank
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%

Association of counties uh the
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to this bill and
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
believes that the current process under
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
28a which requires as representative
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
yella pointed out agreement from the

01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
already provides for public feedback
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
because it happens at a delegation
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
meeting that has public comment and
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
represent buroughs did also point out
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you are currently working a bill
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
through the process House Bill 1125 that
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
would put some more standardized
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
procedures around that public comment
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
but I did want to assure everyone on
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
this committee that counties already do
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
allow public comment at every meeting um
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
another thing we wanted to point out is
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
we are also confused by the language in
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
part one and part two it's not really
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
clear to us because if we're we may post
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
a building for sale but we may not be
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
able to sell it in 30 days so are we
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
putting it up for sale and then waiting
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
till we have an agreement to then post
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
it in the newspaper so it's that part is
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
just a little confusing to us as to how
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
how that all works around um we also did
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to line 17
 
01:37:25.229 --> 01:37:25.239 align:start position:0%
through 20 of the bill which requires an
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
appraiser to evaluate the building
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
before it is sold counties as you all
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
know as members of your delegations have
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
a variety of properties some including
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
collapsed barns that just sit there do
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
we really need an appraisal for a
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
collapsed Barn that we're s selling to a
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
scavenger I don't necessarily think
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
using that fee for an appraiser is
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best use of County funds
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
um I will conclude my testimony there
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
but happy to take any questions but I
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
will just say I was not involved in the
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
Carol County situation so I can't answer
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your testimony
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
further com uh
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you very much
 
01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you very much
Miss

01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
Horan uh we have no more pink cards um
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
the blue signin sheet has no names on
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
it so with that we will go ahead and
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.719 --> 01:38:48.270 align:start position:0%
 
1460

01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
excellent okay all right so um we will
 
01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead now and reopen the executive
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
session uh we will take the next one in
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
line we have a little
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
time uh that will be HB 1414 relative to
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
Gunstock area commission and ski resort
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
and hold on
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to wait for the clerk to
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:41:10.629 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
all right the clerk is ready to go so I

am going to
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative kahill I
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
believe he may have an amendment
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to be introducing an
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
amendment for representative Barbara
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.589 --> 01:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
224-9548 introduces there a second on
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
that representative yala second would
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%

amendment as far as I um I know about it
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
it looks like there's just um a simple
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
change starting at at line 11 through
 
01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:01.950 align:start position:0%
change starting at at line 11 through
line

01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
13 um changing how the percentage of the
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the 3% would be a gradual increase
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
instead of a instantaneous increase it
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
looks like they're amending it to um
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
gradually increase over the next few
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
years and she the amendment also deletes
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
section two and um from from the
 
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.390 align:start position:0%
section two and um from from the
original

01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:25.400 align:start position:0%

speak to your Amendment yes thank you um
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
I think there was a lot of
 
01:44:57.599 --> 01:44:59.310 align:start position:0%
I think there was a lot of
um

01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
consternation um with some of the
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
language about increasing the amount of
 
01:45:05.639 --> 01:45:07.390 align:start position:0%
language about increasing the amount of
money

01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
and uh public testimony and video
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
recording and all of that stuff um so
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment seeks to do two things um
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
it eliminates all of that um and just
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
focuses on the forensic audit as that
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
seemed to be from the sponsors the most
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
important part of the
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill um and I also changed the effective
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
date to the beginning of the year
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
instead of 90 days after so that um it's
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
Mak sense of rolling every year um that
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
that it that year time frame starts at
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year um I thought
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
that was important so I hope that um you
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
know this simplified Bill uh might even
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't support the bill as a whole
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
you might support the amendment of just
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
focusing this this uh discussion just on
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the forensic audit going forward
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the comments or
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative power thank you
 
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
while I understand um some people in the
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
county their interest in conducting a
 
01:46:28.239 --> 01:46:29.550 align:start position:0%
county their interest in conducting a
forensic

01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
audit we have in statute um the
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
provision or the requirement to conduct
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
an audit annually so the the
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
addition of a forensic audit done
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
randomly every 5 years clearly would be
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
an addition
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
to a a regular audit that's currently um
 
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.390 align:start position:0%
to a a regular audit that's currently um
done

01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
annually and to be clear a forensic
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
audit is special
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
audit um that's more of a deep dive into
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
the financial records to derive evidence
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be used in in a legal
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
proceeding and um the bellnap county
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
delegation it's my understanding that if
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted such an audit to be
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
conducted then they they could vote and
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
have one done so therefore requiring um
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
a forensic audit in RSA in addition to
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
the audit that's currently required in
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
statute to me is um an unnecessary
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
expense for for the county when there's
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
already a provision to do an audit and
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm uncomfortable with putting an
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
additional audit of that
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
level into statute and to my best
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is not in line
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
with normal practice so I for those
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
Reasons I'm unable to support this
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
provision in an amendment or in the
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill thank you further
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
comments representative Kelly hi thank
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um representative Kelly
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
pull pull that mic closer so we can hear
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
you I um would normally agree with your
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
assessment um but in this case I feel
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
that there is a lot I hate this um a lot
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
of um consternation amongst everybody um
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems um and I'm um I guess
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar once this amendment is dealt
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
with we'll be dealing with the
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
questions we're currently dealing just
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
with the amendment now once we get to
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill you can do that so
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to comment as opposed to
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
question at this point uh no no
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay unless you're commenting on the
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm commenting on my belief
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
that this amendment is valuable well
 
01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
then speak to it
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I I tend to not like to speak so I
 
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
would rather not but um I have questions
 
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
like um I I'm wondering if someone can
 
01:49:24.589 --> 01:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
answer how much property tax is paced on
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh is paid on lease properties at
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
Gunstock like ski club houses and
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
whatever um things like that that have
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
happened for so long that I think a
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
foren that got it is necessary and worth
 
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
foren that got it is necessary and worth
the

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
expense thank you further comments or
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
questions sen
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr uh chairman
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I have a question to the sponsor
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
of this again
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that all of the bill
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
would be wiped out and the new Amendment
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
would be put in so lines
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
one through 18 would be wiped out and
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
this would be in this place okay thank
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
you further comments questions
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
represent yes thank you this this
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is a replace all and uh so
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
this would be in the entire Bill all all
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
six glorious lines of it um
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
the I think that a little bit uh my
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
belief with that previous bill was that
 
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
there was um some political
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
ramifications about deciding who who
 
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to decide and and be able
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
to bring up dust um regarding the sale
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
of something with this I think we're
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
going the other way and saying that
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
there this is avoiding that dust up of
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh political uh personalities getting
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
involved in whether or not someone is
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to do an fin Financial uh forensic
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
audit um and uh so I think that in it in
 
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
and of itself is valuable and that this
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
is you know a
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh government own asset and it's very
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
important that the government knows that
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:51:26.159 --> 01:51:27.669 align:start position:0%
it is
being

01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
um handled properly proper
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
properly and so I think that that this
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
small investment to make sure that it is
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
um being run and um in an aboveboard
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
manner um is a safeguard for their asset
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the long term so I hope that
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
you'll be supportive so thank you
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to e echo my colleague
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
sentiments I think that just about every
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
publicly traded company out there
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
conducts audits of their corporations
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
for their shareholders and and I think
 
01:52:08.109 --> 01:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
that this isn't just for the purposes of
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
Court this could be used in in that
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
setting but it it has other purposes as
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
well um it has the purp can be used for
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of conducting a Better
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
Business and making more more money for
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
the owners of that business in this case
 
01:52:24.239 --> 01:52:27.149 align:start position:0%
the owners of that business in this case
it's

01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
Elwood yes thank you Mr
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um I asked representative Bean
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
Harry Bean
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
if Gunstock had had a a fraud waste and
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
abuse policy and it was I was stopped or
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
talked to the lobbyist outside this
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
morning I asked him the same
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
question and I get no response it's my
 
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that they redid their
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
policies um after the debacle and that's
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
fine but I find it odd that people don't
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
understand what a fraud waste and abuse
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
it okay uh repres representative
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
going to go along with our
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Powers uh her opinion I
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we're here sitting in
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
conquer we should be managing Gunstock
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
Gunstock for all I know is very
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
successful if the people of the
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
residents of Bap County if they're not
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
happy with what the representatives do
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
they can vote them out if all the people
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
in bout County want a an audit um then
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
they get rid of the people that don't
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
want the audit but I certainly don't
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
want want this committee coming into my
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
business in cow County and telling us
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
what to do especially if friends have
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
got it it's very expensive if we're
 
01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
going to tell them we're going to do it
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
we should be paying for it uh and I have
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
I have faith in all the members of the
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
delegation there seems to be a small
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
minority that are demanding this
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
forensic onit and I think it should stay
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
at the delegation level let them talk to
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
the other members let them talk to the
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
voters and they can decide within the
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
county whether they want to do this or
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
not thank you thank you further comments
 
01:54:16.719 --> 01:54:17.470 align:start position:0%
not thank you thank you further comments
or

01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative priest
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I also agree with
 
01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative McDonald and Power on
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
this I think a forensics audit is
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
just over the top and since they're
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
required to do an audit on a yearly
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
basis and they continue to do that that
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
should be sufficient if the people of
 
01:54:44.589 --> 01:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
bnap County if the delegation feels that
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
this is not enough they can vote in a
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
motion to have a forensics a it done uh
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the uh ski
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
area repres
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you Mr chair um I agree with
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative Powers um summation of
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
existing law and would only seek to ask
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
if requiring this particular County to
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
do a forensic audit would be an unfunded
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
mandate unless un
 
01:55:18.599 --> 01:55:21.189 align:start position:0%
mandate unless un
unconstitutional

01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
further comments or
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I will make uh
 
01:55:29.069 --> 01:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
make a comment
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
um I I am in in favor of this and I will
 
01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.790 align:start position:0%
um I I am in in favor of this and I will
explain

01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
why while a forensic audit is above and
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
beyond the the annual audit I I'd liken
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
it to the difference between every year
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
we file our income
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
taxes it goes in the IRS well nowadays
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably automated the computer
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
looks at it and looks for any
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and for the most
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
part it goes through that's that's your
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
annual audit a forensic audit is when
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
the IRS sees something and they go hey
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
wait a minute look at look at
 
01:56:06.679 --> 01:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
wait a minute look at look at
representative

01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.510 align:start position:0%
representative
turcot's

01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
turcot's
 
01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
uh return from uh 2023 we see an issue
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
with that representative turkot I get a
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
notice um please bring in all your
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
returns and receipts for the last three
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
years we're going to do a u a look into
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
your your tax returns that's what a
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
forensic audit is or the equivalent in
 
01:56:29.719 --> 01:56:33.310 align:start position:0%
forensic audit is or the equivalent in
my

01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.910 --> 01:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
case let's not gloss over the issue here
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
in bellnap County with Gunstock all
 
01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
right there's a history there and it is
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
political you can't get around it um I
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
originally approached both sides call it
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
sides whatever you want to call it
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
on this bill to see if there was some
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
way we could come out with um kind of a
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
middle ground where both sides would
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
finally kind of bury the hatchet on this
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is really in my opinion gotten out
 
01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.830 align:start position:0%
this is really in my opinion gotten out
of

01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
control and the delegation is political
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
we deal with that in my County right
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
now it's very
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
political by putting in forensic audit
 
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:19.719 align:start position:0%
that's every five years it takes the
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
politics out of it and I think any time
 
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
that we can find in our rsas where we
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
can eliminate the political or the
 
01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
personal issues with it I'm in favor and
 
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
I think this is one now if this turns
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
out to be such a bad
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
expense um which I honestly every five
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
years I do not believe it would be um
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
somebody can put in a u Amendment or a
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill the in the future years to remove
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
it I just don't see this as a a big
 
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
burden and quite honestly it might
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually eliminate some of the animosity
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
that continues to happen up in belnap
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
County so I I am in favor of this
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
um that's what I have for the comments
 
01:58:06.639 --> 01:58:08.830 align:start position:0%
um that's what I have for the comments
or

01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we'll ask the

believe there will
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%

as I uh spoke easier considering the
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
other amendments uh I think it's
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
something that the the delegation in
 
02:00:35.069 --> 02:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
Bound up County can decide what they're
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
going to do and how they're going to run
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
the mountain uh I live in wo which is
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
just on the other side of the lake and
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
if heard nothing but great things about
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
how gun stock is being run and being
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
operated uh we've had a lot of bills
 
02:00:49.470 --> 02:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
concerning this mountain and I think
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
they're on the uh the positive streak
 
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
and they should be able to run the M
 
02:00:56.589 --> 02:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
they where they want to with uh the
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
delegation setting the standards and the
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
goals that the molon should should
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
should reach along with the uh
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I ask you to support
 
02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.229 align:start position:0%

02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
Gunstock oversight committees opposed
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
this bill the bellnap county delegation
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%

02:01:35.069 --> 02:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
the Gunstock area commission as well as
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
the bellnap County Board of
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%

02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
good reasons to to vote uh no on itl

with my colleague which is um rare but
 
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
um it's sad that uh we don't want actual
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
oversight um when we're pushing
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
oversight on so many other issues most
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the time but this is no no different
 
02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:21.910 align:start position:0%
of the time but this is no no different
representative

02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair we heard in
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh the
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
um this bill was not brought to the full
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
delegation in a a timely manner and I
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
did look at the uh meeting minutes for
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
the uh commission or the delegation in
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
question and it's true that um um the
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
notice of this was brought up at the
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
time of approving the agenda they have a
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
kind of funny way of doing business
 
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
where they announce the meeting and then
 
02:03:04.069 --> 02:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
have an agenda and then they vote to
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
approve the agenda and this item was
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
pushed onto the agenda at that meeting
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
so there was no public notice that this
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
was going to be heard by the delegation
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
or the public at all so for that reason
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh just a a procedural error that made a
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
difference I can't vote for this
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
bill represent Galler so I kind of um
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
alluded to this in one of my questions
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
um at the Bill's hearing but um I
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
believe that the um that the results of
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
the previous election uh should be
 
02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted as a referendum on this
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
whole issue and that we should respect
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%

McDonald I'm going to uh vote against
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
the itl uh as as she said the represent
 
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
said there are certain towns that are
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
allowing the exemptions but there are
 
02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:35.719 align:start position:0%
communities that aren't um I'm not a I'm
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
not a Freemason uh my dad was and I did
 
02:07:39.629 --> 02:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit of work on the history and
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
it was established back in 1717
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
1717 in England and some of the people
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
that are have been Masons father father
 
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
found in fathers George Washington Ben
 
02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:51.149 align:start position:0%
found in fathers George Washington Ben
Benjamin

02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
Benjamin
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
Franklin uh the Roosevelt Franklin
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt Joe for Harry Truman Winston
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%

02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
Charles Lindberg Buzz Aldren mosa Mark
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
Twain and the list goes on and on and on
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
and if anything I think the Mason groups
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh have gone to the top of the list as
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
far as uh getting any type of uh break
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
on their taxes I have a masonic temple
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
in my community U we have a dentist that
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
belongs he provides free uh dental work
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
to Veterans and also people that
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't have the money to
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
have the dental work they also do a
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
breakfast on Sundays to make that
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
available to the public and a lot of
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
other things that they don't brag about
 
02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:33.079 align:start position:0%
or they don't tell their Community about
 
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh but the two or 3,000 they may lose
 
02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
paying the taxes in Wolf bro uh the town
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
gets more than a benefit enough of all
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
the services they provide and I think
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's a group that should be supported by
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
us just based on the uh the previous
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
membership and what some of these
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
you rep representative K yes I'm going
 
02:08:59.549 --> 02:08:59.559 align:start position:0%

our committee I heard from my own
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
constituents um which was surprising um
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I overwhelmingly got the request to
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
support this bill so I will be
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%

priest thank you Mr uh chairman I agree
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
with my fellow colleague um that I think
 
02:10:32.669 --> 02:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
this bill has unintended
 
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
consequences I agree that the Masons do
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
a lot for our
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
communities but so does the Elks the
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
Shriners you name the list and this will
 
02:10:44.669 --> 02:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
just open the door for all of them to
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions and we the residential
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
property owners will have to pick up the
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
tab the differences for all this thank
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
comments represent
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman um I've
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
thought a lot about this bill and um I
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
could see both sides to to the issue and
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
my first comment is that it's my
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that charitable
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state that want to
 
02:11:21.549 --> 02:11:21.559 align:start position:0%
be recognized as such need to file an
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
application with the Department of
 
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
Justice um under the charitable trust
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau and when I went to the doj
 
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
website and I looked I saw 367 page a
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
page of a spreadsheet with approximately
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
13,000 registered Charities and I only
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
found two Masonic lodges or associations
 
02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
registered and in good standing so that
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
that's notable
 
02:11:55.549 --> 02:11:55.559 align:start position:0%
um and that those would be two Masonic
 
02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
lodges or associations did I say in New
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there there's many Charities
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
that are in state and out of
 
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
state A further note is the 2007 Supreme
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
Court decision in the case of Elder
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
Trust of Florida versus the town of
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
epson and basically based on um
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
testimony during the hearing that the
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mason's charters in their Charters
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcable obligation to
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
perform charitable functions so to
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
summarize my concerns uh in general are
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
this while the Mason principles are
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
commendable and they undoubtedly perform
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
some charitable
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
functions and that's part of their
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
nature and purpose the primary focus of
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
these groups is fraternal and it's
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
focused on a fraternal function rather
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
than being solely charitable and for
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
those reasons um I'm going to support
 
02:12:59.470 --> 02:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
the motion of
 
02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
itl Representative
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so um like GRE MCN i' like
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
to First acknowledge that um yeah I
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
might not be aming myself but I have had
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
a masonic uh family member my
 
02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
a masonic uh family member my
grandfather

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
grandfather
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
was a Shriner which is a type of Mason
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
um with the Elkin's Lodge um but so that
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
being said um though as much as I loved
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
my grandfather I don't think we should
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
be giving um special handouts to um
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
specific groups like this um the New
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution it says that
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
government's um instituted um not for
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
the private interest or Ament of any one
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
man family or class of men and I think
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
that uh this bill would be in violation
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
this further comments or
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
question okay seeing none I will make a
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
couple um I I will support the motion of
 
02:14:23.069 --> 02:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
itl um and here here's the main reason
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
um in this committee I I try to be as
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
consistent on policy as as as as
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
possible and I mean it's difficult to do
 
02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
it 100% of the time but we we I believe
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
we need to be consistent on our policy
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
right now there are over 15 or or 15
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
02:14:42.719 --> 02:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
property tax
exemptions

02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
listed um that a town can take advantage
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
of I don't believe we should be
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
extending that list because every
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
exemption that we
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
Grant somebody else has to pick up the
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
redistribution I contacted My Town last
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
year on a totally different issue and
 
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
asked the the young guy who runs our
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
administrative town he's awesome and I
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
said if all those exemptions didn't
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
exist what how much would the property
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
tax go down on on somebody who doesn't
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
climb any exemptions he goes I happen to
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
keep track of that and he sent it to Me
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
2 and a half% now that may not sound
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
like a lot
 
02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
but take your property tax multiply it
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
by 2.5% and say that's a nice chunk of
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
change I would like to keep rather than
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
redistributing to other
 
02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
redistributing to other
entities

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
entities
 
02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to tie it exactly
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
to um charity work but if I had 2.5% of
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
my property taxes
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
back I could donate that into addition
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
what I already do on charity to a
 
02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
charity that I want and not necessarily
 
02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
what somebody else is doing
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason I will be
 
02:16:14.549 --> 02:16:14.559 align:start position:0%
supporting the I itl I think it's a
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
principal issue it is a principal issue
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
for me um
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard to vote against the speaker
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
who's the Prime sponsor of this but
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I I told him very early on that I
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
can't support it he understood it and
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
he's probably watching now um but
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
um we got we got to vote principal and
 
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
not personalities so with that um I'm
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
done further comments
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
questions represent Gilman thank you Mr
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
chair uh I I know that in the uh
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
testimony was the
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh information that Masonic lodges fall
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
under a 501 C10 a charitable
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
organization as opposed to a
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
501c3 which has and it has to do with
 
02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:11.070 align:start position:0%
501c3 which has and it has to do with
their

02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh I want um how they're organized and
 
02:17:23.549 --> 02:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
it includes then the definition
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
definition uh charitable organizations
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
and under 501 C10 and that's what the
 
02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
Masonic lodger Association also um
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
defines themselves as so I think it's
 
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
already possible for them to ask for uh
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
a tax
 
02:17:45.629 --> 02:17:45.639 align:start position:0%
exemption further comments or
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
questions represent stavis
 
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will also be
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl on this bill I was
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the um when the bill was
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
presented that the bill does exempt
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
properties that the Masonic lodges May
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
rent um and I I remember asking the
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
question well how will The Lodges know
 
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
that those properties are not to be tax
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
exempt and the response was well of of
 
02:18:17.709 --> 02:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
course they will know rather than Maybe
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
we should write that into the bill so I
 
02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
I just see the um potential for
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
confusion and uh complexity around those
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
lodges that do have prop properties that
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
are rented at a
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
profit uh and um generally
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
speaking think that every tax exemption
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we Grant just moves that those tax
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
dollars onto someone else to have to
 
02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay um seeing no no more comments
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%

one out quickly representative Davis um
 
02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
um then we the uh Subs who are here will
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
not need to be here anymore unless they
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
want to hang out with Municipal and
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%

ministrative clerical assessment or
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
valuation errors which makes the bill
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.309 --> 02:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
ambiguity thank you for the comments and
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman um with
 
02:22:09.389 --> 02:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
regards to the amendment um I do
 
02:22:14.349 --> 02:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the words in bold are
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
more specific and therein lies my
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
concern so I had an extensive
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
conversation with a local assessor with
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
over 30 years of professional
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
experience and we discussed um the bill
 
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
and I asked him questions so that I
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
could understand um the bill and what
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
the bill is doing more clearly and um
 
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion revolved around
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
the the word good cause so my concern is
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
is removing good cause from RSA is
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
something that should not be taken
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
lightly for a number of reasons so
 
02:22:56.349 --> 02:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
current statute allows municipalities to
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
Abate taxes for good cause shown under
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 76 colon 16 which is established to
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
be a demonstrable error in the
 
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
assessment calculation or a
 
02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:09.790 align:start position:0%
assessment calculation or a
disproportionate

02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
disproportionate
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
assessment also good cause can also
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
um mean and it has also been established
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
to to to Encompass the showing poverty
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
or inability to pay
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
and notably there's also a full body of
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
case law surrounding um and based on
 
02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:34.030 align:start position:0%
case law surrounding um and based on
good

02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
cause so my concern is is that this this
 
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
amendment while it is more clear and
 
02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:41.790 align:start position:0%
amendment while it is more clear and
more

02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
specific um the words administrative
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
clerical assessment or
 
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation are eras it does not take
 
02:23:53.950 --> 02:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
into account a very real um situation
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
where a
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
house there was a house in my
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood for example that was
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
leveled due to a gas explosion or
 
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
another example
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
that is not enabled through this
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is a situation where a person
 
02:24:14.269 --> 02:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
through no no fault of their own um has
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
an accident there's some type of a
 
02:24:19.389 --> 02:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
mistake AK or a misfortune where they
 
02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
may lose their job they're in an
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
accident that they they can't work
 
02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
there's a medical um situation in in
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
which they they can't work or their
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
finances are are
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
depleted and they're unable therefore to
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
immediately pay their taxes and they're
 
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
in a very difficult transition period
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
the assessor that I spoke with explained
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
that they do everything to avoid
 
02:24:51.269 --> 02:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
non-payment of taxes they will put
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
people on payment plans first and they
 
02:24:57.269 --> 02:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
really Grant total discharge from the
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
payment of of taxes so my my concern is
 
02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
is that again while this language is
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to Abate taxes
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
and it's removing the the local control
 
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
by the um assessors or the Selectmen who
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
who Abate taxes so for that reason I
 
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't support the
 
02:25:33.269 --> 02:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative K I think the
 
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is just a common sense
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment and really strengthens the
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill it does a really fantastic
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
job repres represent
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
Davis uh thank you Mr chair just just
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
point out that um the bill does not
 
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
organizations other comments questions I
 
02:25:59.870 --> 02:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
see none I will make some comments
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
um as you see at the top of the list I
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
was the one who actually put the
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
amendment in and I'm going to explain
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
why I talked with the original sponsor
 
02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:09.630 align:start position:0%
why I talked with the original sponsor
representative

02:26:09.630 --> 02:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
Maguire and if you will remember on line
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
11 it said he had struck in the word
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
shall and put in the word may um as I
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier on a different bill I
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
think where we can take up take out the
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
subjectivity of political and personal
 
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
issues I think we should do that anytime
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
we can and the testimony that was given
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
on the the situation that brought this
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
up was not so much a shall or a may but
 
02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
it was the length of time that was
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
required um when the request was uh
 
02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
they gave a request for additional
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
information and they couldn't find for
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
some reason they couldn't find the
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
records in time so I explained to him I
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
said isn't it better that we actually
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
extend the days rather than the mayor sh
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
again shall eliminates the the subject
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
yes at the end of line 11 you'll see
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
that it was struck out unless it is
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
found that such requests were
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
unreasonable again again that's a very
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
subjective line unreasonable who
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
determines what's unreasonable what is
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
unreasonable you know again that's in
 
02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
the eye Beholder I will remind some of
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
you won't remember because you weren't
 
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
here um or no everybody was here last
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
ter um there was a representative Smith
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
brought forth a similar
 
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill because of two court issues that
 
02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
had happened in New Hampshire one was in
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
Berlin and one was I believe was in this
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
town of O and the Berlin one was
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
interesting or Illuminating in that the
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in the town basically used
 
02:27:56.110 --> 02:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
this clause for good cause shown and
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
basically cut themselves a deal Abad
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
their property taxes so where we can
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate the subjectivity um I think
 
02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's good line 13 and that's what we
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
do for good cause shown that was the the
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
Clause that they used to uh um try to
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
give themselves or a relative of an
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
abatement and again remember this is on
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
abatement of
 
02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
taxes um and so that's why we ended up
 
02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
with the administrative clerical
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
assessment or evaluation
 
02:28:30.349 --> 02:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
errors so I I am in support of this I I
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
I think it takes a subjectivity in the
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
political personalities out of it and uh
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
you know if it's found to be in the
 
02:28:40.670 --> 02:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
future that
 
02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh it it creates issues I I'm sure
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
somebody can bring bring forward a
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
another bill

want to speak thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:28:55.269 --> 02:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
was recently made aware of a an
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
organization in a town where the
 
02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
computer um there's a computer error and
 
02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
was overcharging an
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
organization um so that organization
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
under this would be we wouldn't have to
 
02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
worry about whether it was good cause
 
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
because it was a some sort of evaluation
 
02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
error based you know in the
 
02:29:19.269 --> 02:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
algorithm or computer program so I think
 
02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
that this helps with that thank you

02:29:43.389 --> 02:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
that in my conversation with the with
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
the assessor he he did comment that if
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
some someone um is concerned about Bad
 
02:29:53.710 --> 02:29:53.720 align:start position:0%

02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
there are in fact currently ways to look

into it and um I have in my notes
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
something about an OS order but
 
02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I didn't write down what
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
OS means but my point is is that we
 
02:30:09.429 --> 02:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
already have the tools that we available
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%

02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
repres
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um I just don't see the
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
need for this um bill in its entirely
 
02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
and it's an entirety I don't
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
um I think that wasn't enough of an
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
issue shown um that they were not able
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
to do what they should have done or that
 
02:35:30.269 --> 02:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
there's some abuse or anything I don't I
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
think that um I think there was uh a
 
02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
reference to by representative McDonald
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
about a prior Bill about extending stuff
 
02:35:44.429 --> 02:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
and making making people be able to um
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
kind of uh get exemptions or
 
02:35:53.469 --> 02:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
get um without following the
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
timeline um and I feel like this is just
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
another example of of you know ex
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
extending it and making it easier for
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
people to get um in in this case um
 
02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
people to get um in in this case um
abatements

02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
abatements
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
and uh so I think that that is I think
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no problem with that
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
process right now and so I'm going to be
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
voting against this so thank you could
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
everybody who is not speaking please
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
mics thank you represent
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
St thank you Mr chair um I I think it
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
it's not constructive to conflate one
 
02:36:37.269 --> 02:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
bill with another bill um especially
 
02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
when the subject matter is actually
 
02:36:42.750 --> 02:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
quite different uh and and so I would
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
urge members if I may to focus on this
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass as amended and not
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
try and relate it to any previous bill
 
02:36:55.469 --> 02:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
that we have voted on thank you thank
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%

recognize and appreciate uh the uh the
 
03:38:49.150 --> 03:38:49.160 align:start position:0%

03:38:51.870 --> 03:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
through to uh and the committee to to do
 
03:38:54.030 --> 03:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
this so I want to thank you for that um
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
I do have a constituent here who will be
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm actually in the middle of
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
an executive session so my chairman has
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
been very gracious to uh let me jump out
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
for a minute but I have to run back
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
as I think I might have mentioned the
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
as I think I might have mentioned the
wrong

03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh do you have in front of you
 
03:39:15.309 --> 03:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
805h yes
 
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
805 so uh the amendment is 2024
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
805h not the one that I previously
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned okay continue yes thank you so
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
I am going to my constituent is here
 
03:39:30.030 --> 03:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
this was ultimately the she was the
 
03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
impetus for this um so when I have to
 
03:39:34.870 --> 03:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
jump out to go to Executive session she
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
will be uh available to testify and
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
answer any of the detailed questions but
 
03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
this came about
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
um um locally uh in in our town where a
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
gaming uh
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
facility um wanted to come to town and
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
um you know there was no in the state of
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you have to get a license
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
from the the lottery for a charitable
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
gaming facility and the license is is uh
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh issued and then depending on local
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
zoning um that facility can or can't
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
operate and the
 
03:40:13.950 --> 03:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
various things that come with zoning uh
 
03:40:15.269 --> 03:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things though that we found
 
03:40:17.790 --> 03:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
out that really was different than
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
previous gambling bills and I'm not
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
anti-gambling um you know but what I am
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
is is very local very pro- local control
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
and what we found was that uh when the
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
state permitted Kino in municipalities
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
the municipality could vote whether to
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
allow Kino or not to allow Kino um and
 
03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh that seemed to be very popular
 
03:40:42.550 --> 03:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes do it sometimes don't but when
 
03:40:44.590 --> 03:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
it came to games of chance and
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing that local
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
option uh was not was is not available
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh I can only guess that it perhaps was
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
an oversight um I know that this the hrh
 
03:40:58.830 --> 03:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming came about during the
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
the pandemic uh or some of those aspects
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
of that came about during the pandemic
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
when things were U uh not as they seem
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
so that's really what this this bill
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
entails it allows for a local option
 
03:41:13.389 --> 03:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
just like similar to Kino for um
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing uh in games of
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
chance it allows that uh if if the if
 
03:41:25.229 --> 03:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
the town votes to permit that activity
 
03:41:28.110 --> 03:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
um it can revoke that if no facilities
 
03:41:29.950 --> 03:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
open up within a certain time period so
 
03:41:33.469 --> 03:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
if they permit the the the activity and
 
03:41:35.710 --> 03:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
three years goes by and there's no
 
03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
facilities that open up the town can
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
then revote to revoke that uh um um uh
 
03:41:44.189 --> 03:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
permission now one thing I do want to
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
note out note is that this we did I did
 
03:41:50.110 --> 03:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
work very closely with my constituent
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and with OS again another another shout
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
out to OS because they really worked
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
long and hard to do a number of drafts
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
with this but one of the things that
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
they pointed out that may cause some
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
confusion and and and I'll let the
 
03:42:07.870 --> 03:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee decide is if you look on page
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
two um I'll I'll give you this example
 
03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's found on page three as well
 
03:42:12.680 --> 03:42:14.269 align:start position:0%
it's it's found on page three as well
line

03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
five and line
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
16 um line three starts off the
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
municipality has voted to allow the
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
operation of historic horse racing
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
machines and if no facility allowed to
 
03:42:27.950 --> 03:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
operate historic horse racing machines
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this section or which was
 
03:42:34.149 --> 03:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
permitted prior to July 1st
 
03:42:37.030 --> 03:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
2024 there's no permits that are issued
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
um there are licenses that come from the
 
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um and then it
 
03:42:46.229 --> 03:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
goes on to say prior to July 1 2024 has
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
begun operation within 3 years of the
 
03:42:51.389 --> 03:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
grant of permission so the municipality
 
03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
would Grant permission but they don't
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
give permits so there may be some you
 
03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
know changes of those words that maybe
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh add some clarity and that was OS had
 
03:43:02.149 --> 03:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
suggested that as well and I think I
 
03:43:05.149 --> 03:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
gave the chair uh a copy of that um but
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's really what it is and uh
 
03:43:10.590 --> 03:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to ask my cons if if the
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
chair would allow my consistent to come
 
03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
up and and and testify at this point um
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
I would allow her to to take it from
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
here and answer any questions that the
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee may have she's really done a
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
lot of research on this and is well
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
versed in this topic so just
 
03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
procedurally uh we will allow the other
 
03:43:30.070 --> 03:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
representatives to speak first sure and
 
03:43:32.469 --> 03:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
then we will go to the other individuals
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions uh
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative your representative power
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I understand that
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
you need to get to an executive session
 
03:43:42.910 --> 03:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll make it really quick in your
 
03:43:45.070 --> 03:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
bill introduction you've you used the
 
03:43:48.429 --> 03:43:48.439 align:start position:0%
word facility a number of times my
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
question is could you clarify what a
 
03:43:54.110 --> 03:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
facility is I'm not a gambler but I do
 
03:43:56.510 --> 03:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
am aware that there's Kino in my town in
 
03:43:57.630 --> 03:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
a Chinese
 
03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
restaurant so that being said it is also
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding that historic horse
 
03:44:07.229 --> 03:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
racing again I'm not a gambler is is
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
more suitable for to be in a venue of a
 
03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
casino is that correct or incorrect can
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
you like square that with the use of
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
facility versus Casino again I think
 
03:44:20.710 --> 03:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
that and and I'll let my constituent
 
03:44:22.630 --> 03:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
again if you could also Reserve that
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
question for her as well and she can
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
maybe um contradict me but but uh uh and
 
03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
that and that's not necess again she's
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research on this but when
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
when we look at facility the intent is
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know a large scale facility casino
 
03:44:40.269 --> 03:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
type type thing and and again that's why
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know and you bring up a good point
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the facility the casino we want to
 
03:44:47.070 --> 03:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
raise the bar a little bit when we when
 
03:44:49.830 --> 03:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
we worked on this legislation on how the
 
03:44:52.750 --> 03:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
this permission is revoked we wanted to
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
raise the bar in that it just can't be
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
on a whim I mean these are facilities
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
that have made considerable investments
 
03:45:01.469 --> 03:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
in the community um buildings Capital
 
03:45:04.830 --> 03:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
licensing employment U so these
 
03:45:08.349 --> 03:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
facilities I.E casinos um that's that's
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
the intent of that again it's the other
 
03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
intent is not to be able to pull the rug
 
03:45:14.349 --> 03:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
out from under these folks who have put
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars into uh
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
communities representative
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
question sorry I came in a little bit
 
03:45:30.309 --> 03:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
late so maybe you've already addressed
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
this um what is the need the the rush I
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
guess for this bill um and why was why
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it just filed during normal
 
03:45:47.229 --> 03:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh Bill filing time yeah this came about
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh as Midstream in we discovered that
 
03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a local option for uh
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
casino type gambling Kino there's a
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
local option municipalities can vote
 
03:46:00.750 --> 03:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
whether they want it or not our our
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
local um um town uh has a casino likely
 
03:46:08.910 --> 03:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
coming in uh and some of the residents
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
in town wanted see what you know what
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
could be done as far as gauging the
 
03:46:15.510 --> 03:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
community's support for this you know we
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
have Kino The Kino uh is a very simple
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
referendum if you will that can be put
 
03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
on a ballot that can gauge us sport when
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
when when the folks from our community
 
03:46:27.070 --> 03:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
went to do that in Littleton they found
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
out there's really no mechanism to
 
03:46:30.429 --> 03:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the the
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
community wants it or not um and as you
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
as you as you are aware um you know
 
03:46:37.590 --> 03:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
gambling in casinos you know it's it's
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
an emotional issue it can be a hot
 
03:46:41.149 --> 03:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
button issue I mean there's some social
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
concerns that are brought up uh law
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement um you know those are all
 
03:46:48.030 --> 03:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
issues that we've heard about uh uh in
 
03:46:51.309 --> 03:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
my Committee in Ways and Means um so you
 
03:46:55.870 --> 03:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
know I Feel Again local as a locality um
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
who are going to be affected by this
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's important that the municipalities
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
have a you know at least can can can can
 
03:47:05.950 --> 03:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
live up to the precedent that was set in
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
Kino representative
 
03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:10.950 align:start position:0%
Kino representative
lales

03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
lales
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I I feel very
 
03:47:22.830 --> 03:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh dumb on this issue but um could you
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
define the the phrase historic horse
 
03:47:27.720 --> 03:47:30.030 align:start position:0%
define the the phrase historic horse
racing

03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
racing
 
03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
machines I I I think of a carnival where
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
you have a you know horses running
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
across and squirting water into the
 
03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:40.870 align:start position:0%
across and squirting water into the
mouth

03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
of but what is a historic horse racing
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
machine prior to my election to the New
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house I probably would have
 
03:47:54.030 --> 03:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
been on the same page as you um but uh
 
03:47:55.110 --> 03:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
and I know there are folks from the
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
industry here that if I get this wrong
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
they can uh they can they can um correct
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
me but a historical horse racing machine
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
is really you know if it would
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
assimilate I I don't like to use the the
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
term I don't it's a well for lack of a
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
better term it looks like a slot machine
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
in that's it's it's its uh dimensions
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
and the way it works but what it does is
 
03:48:21.229 --> 03:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
it takes historical horse races over the
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
course of several years it makes them
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
Anonymous so you don't know where the
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
race was you don't know who the horse
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
was and so you can't determine who the
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
winner is and and then you can bet on
 
03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:35.149 align:start position:0%
winner is and and then you can bet on
that

03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:39.790 --> 03:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
race um to get an outcome so you know in
 
03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:41.070 align:start position:0%
race um to get an outcome so you know in
the

03:48:41.070 --> 03:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
2012 running of the you know Saratoga
 
03:48:47.590 --> 03:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
Springs horse race that has 12 horses in
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
it you wouldn't know when it was you
 
03:48:50.670 --> 03:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know where it was you wouldn't
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
know the names of the horses but you
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
could bet on the outcome of that and
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a game of chance uh where
 
03:49:00.149 --> 03:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
you could win if uh if if you won that
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
that race and and again I apolog there's
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
folks from the industry behind me if I
 
03:49:07.950 --> 03:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
have butchered that uh um uh they'll let
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
me know but that's
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
I can tell you at the 30,000 foot level
 
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's what it is it's no no
 
03:49:16.349 --> 03:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
squirt guns no popping
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
balloons thank you uh so there's no
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
chance follow up Mr chairman follow up
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
there's no chance for somebody like me
 
03:49:29.309 --> 03:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
to go in and say Ah that's
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
Secretariat no I I think that the folks
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
running these have uh made sure that
 
03:49:35.630 --> 03:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to they're not
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to lose out to somebody with a a
 
03:49:41.550 --> 03:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
your further questions for
 
03:49:43.479 --> 03:49:44.990 align:start position:0%
your further questions for
representative

03:49:44.990 --> 03:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
roord representative Gilman thank you Mr
 
03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking for
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh last year uh there
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
was established a study
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
Commission on charitable gaming
 
03:49:59.110 --> 03:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
including the newly authorized
 
03:50:01.550 --> 03:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
historical horse races and this is to
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
study the effect of recent changes and
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
their report is due in November so why
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
are we doing this now before that report
 
03:50:10.750 --> 03:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
comes yeah that's a good question and
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
and they do meet regularly and they were
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
just they just met on uh Monday um and
 
03:50:19.990 --> 03:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'm told that this could be an Avenue
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
for them to to look into in the future
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
as far as I know this is not on their
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
agenda uh right now um that's not saying
 
03:50:31.630 --> 03:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
it it might not be uh before November
 
03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
but um yeah that's that that commission
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
is ongoing in their work okay thank you
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for spending your I know
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
how tight your your uh time is with your
 
03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:50.550 align:start position:0%
how tight your your uh time is with your
committees

03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
um simple question I
 
03:50:59.550 --> 03:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
think the statement on on the bill says
 
03:51:02.910 --> 03:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
that the amendment gives municipalities
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
the option to operate historic horse
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
I I wonder why I'm curious why the order
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
is that way and if we pass this does
 
03:51:21.720 --> 03:51:23.429 align:start position:0%
is that way and if we pass this does
this

03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
legalize uh all games of chance in the
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um I mean games
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
of chance is uh it's a regulated
 
03:51:35.469 --> 03:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
industry already in the state of New
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um Lottery oversees that you
 
03:51:39.790 --> 03:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
have got a license
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh the background is to to get a license
 
03:51:46.830 --> 03:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
is is is is an extensive process um this
 
03:51:51.389 --> 03:51:51.399 align:start position:0%
would not expand the scope of games of
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
chance in in New Hampshire as as a
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
matter of fact it would just do the
 
03:51:59.229 --> 03:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
opposite will allow municipalities to
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
keep J games of chance out of their
 
03:52:05.590 --> 03:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
choose further questions representative
 
03:52:08.239 --> 03:52:09.790 align:start position:0%
choose further questions representative
stavis

03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
stavis
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so if games of chance
 
03:52:14.189 --> 03:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
are already allowed in New Hampshire and
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
regulated by the gaming
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
commission then how is it that we are
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
giving towns a local option to allow
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
them they are already allowed shouldn't
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
it read to not
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
allow well and actually if you look at
 
03:52:30.510 --> 03:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
the if if you look at the the bill yes
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
and local option
 
03:52:37.790 --> 03:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
would on um
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
page one one line 25 it's very specific
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
the wording that would go on the ballot
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
the wording of the question shall be as
 
03:52:49.469 --> 03:52:49.479 align:start position:0%
follows shall we allow the operation of
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines within the town or
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
city so you're right as it is now um it
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
is allowed but this this would allow
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
that question would allow a negative
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
vote of in the negative
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.630 --> 03:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
no further questions
 
03:53:10.640 --> 03:53:11.910 align:start position:0%
no further questions
represent

03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair um as a novice I
 
03:53:19.630 --> 03:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
need a little bit of
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
explanation can you explain the
 
03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
difference between a historical horse
 
03:53:31.389 --> 03:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
horse race machine and a game of chance
 
03:53:33.309 --> 03:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
yes so historical horse race machine is
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a machine designed for a
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
specific purpose using a specific set of
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
data I.E um historical horse races a
 
03:53:46.189 --> 03:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
game of chance could be Blackjack it
 
03:53:49.630 --> 03:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
could be uh cards it could be other
 
03:53:51.630 --> 03:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
types of electronic and those those
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
would be physical um uh games uh it
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
could be other electronic type games as
 
03:54:00.149 --> 03:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
well um so that's the difference between
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
and and the reason why they're separated
 
03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
there are they are delineated in the law
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
separately um so that's why it's
 
03:54:12.030 --> 03:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood thank you Mr
 
03:54:16.149 --> 03:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at lines 23 and 24
 
03:54:21.550 --> 03:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
1 which talks about
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
um publishing notice of a public Hearing
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
in a newspaper of General circulation at
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
least 7 days before the
 
03:54:41.070 --> 03:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:43.630 --> 03:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
you've limited it to potentially only
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
seven days before the
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah I I think and my
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
constituent can comment on this if I get
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
it wrong I believe that that that
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
wording was taken out of the Kino local
 
03:54:58.870 --> 03:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
option so we wanted to make it as as
 
03:55:02.189 --> 03:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
close to The Kino local option language
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
as as we could so we're not creating a
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of a bunch of new law um so
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
I believe that's where that's where that
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
came from followup sir go ahead um
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
and many times in statute it will
 
03:55:20.670 --> 03:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
mention publishing public hearings on a
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
website is that not includ that's not
 
03:55:26.550 --> 03:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
included here so it's not required by by
 
03:55:28.389 --> 03:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
Statute here and again going back to
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
where Kino that was mimicking Kino but
 
03:55:34.349 --> 03:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
that I mean you're right I I I I don't I
 
03:55:36.910 --> 03:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
read I read my news online rather than
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
in in a physical newspaper my myself so
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
maybe it's time to get with the times
 
03:55:43.030 --> 03:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
and and and make those changes while
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
we're at it thank
 
03:55:47.149 --> 03:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
03:55:49.229 --> 03:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
questions I just have one that might
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
clear sure a lot of this stuff up for
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
everybody is it fair to say that um the
 
03:55:58.110 --> 03:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
wording that you have put in for local
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
option historic horse racing
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
machines and local option games of
 
03:56:06.510 --> 03:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
chance is basically the same language
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
taken out of the Kino local option
 
03:56:11.710 --> 03:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
section and applied with minor edits
 
03:56:13.389 --> 03:56:13.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and you're absolutely
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
right and I say I would say the only
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
difference is we raise the bar on how
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
hard it would be to revoke the privilege
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
because buying a $5,000 Keno machine or
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is to put in a Chinese
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant is a much different
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
investment than putting $20 million into
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
a a new physical building um so we
 
03:56:35.710 --> 03:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise the bar with that
 
03:56:37.710 --> 03:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you all right seeing no
 
03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
more questions thank you you very much
 
03:56:42.750 --> 03:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
on to your committee work thank you uh
 
03:56:45.070 --> 03:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
next up uh again we we have to take them
 
03:56:47.830 --> 03:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
in a specific order next we have rep
 
03:56:47.840 --> 03:56:56.030 align:start position:0%
in a specific order next we have rep

03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
you to representative Ros for to for uh
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
alerting me to this uh amendment that he
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
was putting
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh he invited me to uh help him
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
out with this amendment because
 
03:57:14.950 --> 03:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
Littleton and Conway are kind of along a
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
similar path right now Conway might be a
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
little bit further along we were very
 
03:57:21.550 --> 03:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
surprised to discover that a casino was
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
coming to town um I want to First really
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
Echo a couple points that he made and um
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
the first being this is not about
 
03:57:33.630 --> 03:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
whether you're Pro or anti- gambling
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is about whether you believe that
 
03:57:38.149 --> 03:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's the municipality's decision as to
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
whether to to allow a casino in
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
town um the other piece I want to Echo
 
03:57:47.550 --> 03:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
is that we're not trying to undermine
 
03:57:50.670 --> 03:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
anyone's investment so where we are in
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
Conway we are pretty much resigned to
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that a casino is going to be in
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
town and I'm okay with that I've made
 
03:58:02.149 --> 03:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
peace with that um but I think that this
 
03:58:04.990 --> 03:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment will help other towns not
 
03:58:06.910 --> 03:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
have the situation that we have had in
 
03:58:09.630 --> 03:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
Conway um I think our casino that will
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
be coming to town will be grand
 
03:58:13.950 --> 03:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in um if this amendment
 
03:58:16.189 --> 03:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
were to pass and the bill were to
 
03:58:18.830 --> 03:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
pass for me the and this kind of speaks
 
03:58:20.750 --> 03:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
to representative Gilman's question
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
about why
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
now um for me the reason to deal with
 
03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
this now is that this is an issue that
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
towns are facing on the ground right now
 
03:58:32.710 --> 03:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
this year um you know it's happening in
 
03:58:35.710 --> 03:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
Littleton it's been happening in Conway
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and the the Crux of the question is
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
should we get to
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
decide and in my particular
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
town we have had Kino on our warrant
 
03:58:48.670 --> 03:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
multiple times and the town has
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
consistently voted that
 
03:58:55.229 --> 03:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
down um our Charter uh I disagree with
 
03:58:57.510 --> 03:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
this language in the charter but our
 
03:58:59.469 --> 03:58:59.479 align:start position:0%
Charter says that gambling is a social
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
evil and should be
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
discouraged and yet here we are in this
 
03:59:06.550 --> 03:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
situation where my constituents didn't
 
03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
really have a mechanism for um voicing
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
their opinion on this and maybe they
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
would have surprised me and said yes but
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
for me the Crux of the issue is who gets
 
03:59:17.840 --> 03:59:18.590 align:start position:0%
for me the Crux of the issue is who gets
to

03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:59:21.630 --> 03:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
decide um and I would hope that uh that
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
you would support this amendment I I
 
03:59:25.950 --> 03:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
think it will it will help it will help
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
towns uh who face similar situations
 
03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
like mine um to just be able to have a
 
03:59:33.149 --> 03:59:33.159 align:start position:0%
voice in this process I'm happy to take
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
any questions yeah representative
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
status thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question question um there
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
is a casino currently under construction
 
03:59:44.070 --> 03:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon New Hampshire which I
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
represent y uh which came before the
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
planning board where there was ample
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public comment was there
 
03:59:55.389 --> 03:59:55.399 align:start position:0%
no such planning board hearing in
 
03:59:58.990 --> 03:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
Conway there absolutely was and I won't
 
04:00:00.910 --> 04:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
I won't bore you with the blowby blow
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
but it became very contentious and um
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
subject of some some potential lawsuits
 
04:00:13.950 --> 04:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
um the uh my understanding is that the
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
um that the permitted use was as an
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
indoor amusement was what was being
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
argued um but that was that was
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
contentious and there was not an
 
04:00:28.990 --> 04:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
agreement go ahead um thank you for
 
04:00:31.389 --> 04:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
taking this follow-up question so when
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
our planning board heard this
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
application um and we had a similar
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst our members and
 
04:00:42.030 --> 04:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
members of the public the response from
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
the planning director
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
was the state has allowed
 
04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
it you must allow it
 
04:00:49.760 --> 04:00:51.269 align:start position:0%
it you must allow it
[Music]

04:00:51.269 --> 04:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:00:54.269 --> 04:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'm I'm going to ask a
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
different version of that same question
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
is to why now I mean this seems to be a
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
settled question they go before planning
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
boards the public has a right to comment
 
04:01:10.830 --> 04:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
but and and believe me I'm not happy
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
about this I don't particularly want a
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
casino in Lebanon but it is the
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
law and where do we stop if we give a
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
local option to prohibit one business
 
04:01:26.830 --> 04:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
and not other businesses I'm not happy
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
to ask that question but I'm asking
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
it sure um well I I guess I guess for me
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
the issue is that it does seem to be
 
04:01:40.870 --> 04:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
settled law and do we like it the way it
 
04:01:44.189 --> 04:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
is and that's and that's why I'm here um
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
and in terms of where do we stop I would
 
04:01:47.080 --> 04:01:48.429 align:start position:0%
and in terms of where do we stop I would
say

04:01:48.429 --> 04:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
that gambling businesses are
 
04:01:51.950 --> 04:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
qualitatively a different kind of
 
04:01:54.670 --> 04:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
business than most businesses um and do
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
we agree that they that they should be
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
regulated in exactly the same way as any
 
04:02:02.149 --> 04:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
other business I think Kino gives us a
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
good point of comparison and I think
 
04:02:06.830 --> 04:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's why this amendment in this
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
amendment uh representative rfor chose
 
04:02:12.550 --> 04:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
to mirror that existing statute um I
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
would say that's a
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
comparable um that's a comparable uh
 
04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
activity and it makes sense to me that
 
04:02:27.469 --> 04:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:31.469 --> 04:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
way representative uh y Kella go
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you uh thank you for taking
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
the question um in your testimony and
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
you were talking about your um was it
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
the master plan or your Charter your
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
Charter and how they um demonize
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
um would
 
04:03:01.389 --> 04:03:01.399 align:start position:0%
you um believe that that the that that
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
kite type of bigotry toward this this
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
type of establishment is what the state
 
04:03:10.750 --> 04:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
cuz we have we only voted for for hor
 
04:03:12.990 --> 04:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing in the last few
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
years that we we passed that knowing
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
that there was no local option so that
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
we can that we can have that fight back
 
04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
on against that bigotry um and say no
 
04:03:28.750 --> 04:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
these are a business just like any other
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
business and should not be discriminated
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
just because of the type of business
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
they have or do you think that that um
 
04:03:38.349 --> 04:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
in your your experience that that was
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
just not discussed sure
 
04:03:43.550 --> 04:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
so first let me say and I believe I said
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
this in my testimony I disagree with
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
that language and I think we should
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
change it I think the language is quite
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
strong the reason I raised it is because
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
I think it establishes sort of a a
 
04:03:56.910 --> 04:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
temperature of the Town um I wouldn't
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
characterize it as bigotry um but I
 
04:04:01.229 --> 04:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
would but
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I
 
04:04:06.910 --> 04:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
I I guess my my question that I would
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
pose in return is is is there a
 
04:04:11.550 --> 04:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
difference between a gambling EST
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
establishment and other kinds of
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
establishments in terms of the cost to
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
the community for example so I would
 
04:04:18.880 --> 04:04:20.990 align:start position:0%
the community for example so I would
just

04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:04:23.149 --> 04:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would just turn around and
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
say do we believe that it's a business
 
04:04:28.110 --> 04:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:31.469 --> 04:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
business further comments
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:04:35.790 --> 04:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
much repres
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh thank you very much I'm
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
Jerry Stringham I represent Lincoln
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
Woodstock in Easton um uh first um I I
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
did sign on to this amendment uh I was
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
also in Ways and Means from 2018 to 2020
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
when um when historic horse racing was
 
04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
first brought actually didn't pass uh
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
during that term so first uh let me
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
comment a little bit about what historic
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
horse racing is a historic horse racing
 
04:05:15.750 --> 04:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
is a slot machine with a different back
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
engine um the uh a slot machine is the
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
the winning combination is based on
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
random number generators and what shows
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
up on the screen historic horse racing
 
04:05:30.750 --> 04:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh really really was created in a way to
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
be able to bring slot machines into the
 
04:05:35.790 --> 04:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
state without calling them slot machines
 
04:05:38.590 --> 04:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
so uh what when you you look and you
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
play it it looks just like it you set
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
the thing on autop pick your your horses
 
04:05:48.030 --> 04:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
and you can play uh a game in 8 seconds
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
and push the button again and it comes
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
up and the screen looks like it's got
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
three Aces and two kings you're a winner
 
04:05:57.389 --> 04:05:57.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't you don't see a horse you
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
don't you're not betting on the odds
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing whether the dirt is uh
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's a muddy track or a clear track the
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
way that almost all the games are played
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
is exactly like a slot machine uh so one
 
04:06:14.590 --> 04:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why um uh there wasn't a
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion when this was first
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
going on about where else to put it is
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
because the original Bill limited
 
04:06:23.309 --> 04:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing machine to the
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
established Gaming facilities in the
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
state it's still part of this uh
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee work that's being done now is
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
whether whether we want to extend it or
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
not uh it has the ability a historic
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
horse racing machine assuming the
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission comes up with a way
 
04:06:43.510 --> 04:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
to license it properly and control it
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
properly to be used anywhere a slot
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
machine could be used and uh during a
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
week off I was in Texas I went into a
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
gas station they had three slot machines
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
in there and so you know I don't know
 
04:06:58.750 --> 04:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
what the long-term thing is uh for for
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
this and this possibility right now uh
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
people are are in part probably because
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the extensive use and and Financial
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
potential of having these slot machine
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
like devices in a gaming facility that
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
um uh you know there's an expanded
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
interest in in opening new Gaming
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
facilities like the one in Conway like
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
the one in Lebanon and who who knows
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
where else in the state um and uh so I I
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
really think that the idea of of having
 
04:07:36.030 --> 04:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
a local vote uh to allow this kind of
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
facility and this kind of machine to
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
come in was something that wasn't being
 
04:07:43.389 --> 04:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
uh considered because it was kind of
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
already limited uh significantly there
 
04:07:49.149 --> 04:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
was house there bills this term uh that
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
we voted on whether to limit the number
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
of new facilities or have an unlimited
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
number and so on so um you know I I uh
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know our towns voted both on ke on
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
Kino and both uh Lincoln and Woodstock
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
they had votes on that they had had
 
04:08:08.510 --> 04:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
debates and made decisions
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
I think the the uh uh the experience of
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
having a slot machine like device
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
compared to Kino is very different and
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know the town may may vote the same
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
way they they voted to allow each of
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
them there's I think two Kino machines
 
04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
in one town and one in the other I think
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
having the debate and the public
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of it was a very healthy
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
process uh for the state and under for
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
people to understand what's in there so
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know that that I I think the timing
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh is it's pretty urgent because of
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on um you know the out of
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
some of the out of state Gaming
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
facilities are being or some of the
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
Gaming facilities are being acquired by
 
04:08:55.469 --> 04:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
out ofate uh companies or at least the
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
the uh stock of them is uh part of the
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
original uh limitation was that you know
 
04:09:04.349 --> 04:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
remain uh New Hampshire businesses so uh
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
but now they're having different
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
shareholders so that's uh
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
um it's Le it's legal and permitted
 
04:09:15.870 --> 04:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
around what we have I um I think it's um
 
04:09:18.429 --> 04:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
you know critical that the towns be able
 
04:09:21.149 --> 04:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
to decide whether they want slot machine
 
04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
or slot machine like devices uh which
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
are called historic horse races uh and
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um uh that's why that's why this uh
 
04:09:31.870 --> 04:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
amendment was brought forward at this
 
04:09:35.070 --> 04:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative
 
04:09:37.229 --> 04:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
you for for taking my question so I
 
04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
understand that historic horse
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
racing can and is it can be placed in a
 
04:09:53.469 --> 04:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
casino proper what's not clear to me is
 
04:09:56.109 --> 04:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
with if this bill were to become law and
 
04:09:58.469 --> 04:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
I understand it's enabling
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
legislation can these
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing can historic horse
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
racing be placed in like a gas station
 
04:10:12.109 --> 04:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
or a convenience store or a restaurant
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm trying to understand where
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
these games would be um available is it
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
just in a a a casino or can they be
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
placed in
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
other businesses well this this bill
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
does not change where what type of
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
facility could have historic horse
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
racing as I said when the original bills
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
were passed they were limited to orig to
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the nonprofit gaming centers they
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
kind of call them that because uh every
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
week uh there there's a nonprofit of the
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
week that's affiliated with a gaming
 
04:10:54.030 --> 04:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
facility and they get uh a donation
 
04:10:56.910 --> 04:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
based on basically a percent of the cut
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
from from the uh individual gaming
 
04:11:01.469 --> 04:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
facility and there's some in conquered
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and you know big one over over in
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and so on um so
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen some expansion on
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
where historic horse racing would be
 
04:11:16.750 --> 04:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
allowed basically new Gaming facilities
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
which is on top of what was first passed
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
which originally kind of gave gave the
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
existing Gaming facilities uh a monopoly
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
or an algop I guess based on on
 
04:11:31.630 --> 04:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
facilities that were already um licensed
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
and approved and now it's expanding so
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
where that expansion goes uh this bill
 
04:11:40.429 --> 04:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that at this point this
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
just this just says uh towns have the
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
right to to um allow it into their town
 
04:11:48.399 --> 04:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
right to to um allow it into their town
or

04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
not so you look a little confused but so
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
representative yell thank you
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that you uh were in uh
 
04:12:06.990 --> 04:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
the State House when when uh historic H
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
horse racing was was passed did you
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
support that effort uh so uh actually I
 
04:12:15.630 --> 04:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
was not here when it was passed I was
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
here it was uh substantially discussed
 
04:12:23.630 --> 04:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh in Ways and Means from 2018 to 2020
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
or that that by anym and um uh in
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
general I wasn't supportive of historic
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
horse racing as the bill was written
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
because I I didn't think I thought they
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
were slot machines and I I I didn't and
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
think if we were going to have slot
 
04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
machines they should be licensed to
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
smaller facilities and the State state's
 
04:12:45.309 --> 04:12:45.319 align:start position:0%
take should be substantially higher than
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
than we'll get from these
 
04:12:50.590 --> 04:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
machines so represent s thank you Mr
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
question um speaking of ways and
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
means I have my questions I mean I
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand why this amendment is coming
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
to us because it's enabling legislation
 
04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
but I also understand the extensive
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
discussions that have taken place in
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
ways and means and I'm
 
04:13:12.520 --> 04:13:14.030 align:start position:0%
ways and means and I'm
wondering

04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
what what thread could be drawn
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
between the passage of this should it
 
04:13:26.149 --> 04:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
pass and the diminishment of some of the
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
means coming into the state in the
 
04:13:31.229 --> 04:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
future and and has that been a
 
04:13:33.149 --> 04:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
conversation that's been happening with
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal folks or is this completely
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
divorced from that
 
04:13:41.469 --> 04:13:41.479 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah so I mean I'm I'm the
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
clerk of finance committee 3 this year
 
04:13:46.830 --> 04:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm not in ways and means for for for
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
this part of the discussion um so
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
um representative it's okay to say I
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't know yeah so I don't think I can

today my name is Rick Newman I'm a
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the New Hampshire
 
04:14:30.910 --> 04:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators Association
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
and um we do not support this amendment
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
as written uh for several reasons that
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
I'll go into but I'm going to I will
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
also try to be brief I want to respect
 
04:14:43.149 --> 04:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
your time I want to start I guess by
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
answering some of the questions that
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
have been asked so charitable gaming
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
what we commonly refer to as games of
 
04:14:52.990 --> 04:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
chance was adopted in
 
04:14:57.309 --> 04:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
2006 by House Bill 1744 sponsored by
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ken
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
Wier and I I recall at that time that
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill was was uh presented it was in
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
Edna and there was discussion in the
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittees there were several
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittees there was discussion about
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
a local option uh portion going into
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
that bill it was discussed as I recall
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
at least two or three times um and the
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
the decision was made not to do that so
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
the bill passed in
 
04:15:28.269 --> 04:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
2006 in 2018 or so when the second
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
attempt to pass historic horse racing
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
was made uh the bill was introduced
 
04:15:35.149 --> 04:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
heard by Ways and Means to allow
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing I want to step
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
back just a second understand that under
 
04:15:42.510 --> 04:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
the law today in order to have historic
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
horse racing you have to have a games of
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
chance license so to answer to your
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
question representative power that you
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
have to have a what is called a game
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
operator employer license now while the
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
current state of the situation in New
 
04:16:02.910 --> 04:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that everyone who has a g
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
goe game of of game operator employer
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
license has what we would all commonly
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
call a
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
casino uh the fact of the matter is if I
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
owned a restaurant I could go get a goe
 
04:16:18.510 --> 04:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
license and put Blackjack and a crap
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
table in my banquet room okay uh that
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
has been done in the past and there have
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
been places that did that we don't
 
04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently have anything like that now uh
 
04:16:30.189 --> 04:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
so in order to have historic horse
 
04:16:31.950 --> 04:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
racing you have to have a
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
goe in 2000 I'm I'm trying to do this
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
from memory cuz I I apologize I didn't
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
research it the question of a local
 
04:16:42.269 --> 04:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
option on instor course racing was taken
 
04:16:46.830 --> 04:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
up by the house it was a floor amendment
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
I want to say representative Mary Beth
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
walls uh sponsored it uh it was uh it
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
was in a session prior to co so I think
 
04:16:58.189 --> 04:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
2019 and it was defeated by the house
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
the house also by the way that year
 
04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
defeated historic horse racing
 
04:17:08.109 --> 04:17:08.119 align:start position:0%
legislation when it was passed in 20 21
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
there was no Amendment offered to make a
 
04:17:13.950 --> 04:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
local option okay so I I set that as a
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a ground just to to say this in since
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
the passage of historic horse race there
 
04:17:24.429 --> 04:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
have been significant Investments by
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
various game operator Employers in
 
04:17:30.269 --> 04:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
bringing what we will call Charity
 
04:17:33.149 --> 04:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
casinos to the various
 
04:17:35.910 --> 04:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
communities that investment ranges from
 
04:17:37.950 --> 04:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere from
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
probably on the low side I would say
 
04:17:42.870 --> 04:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
would be one in Hampton Beach where they
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
probably put about $2 million in there's
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
one being constructed in Nashville right
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
now where I don't have any inside
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
information but I've read in the paper
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
the total investment is about $240
 
04:17:58.389 --> 04:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
million so this is a significant
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
investment so get that gets us to our
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
concern about this
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
language we would not be opposed for
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
looking forward to having a local option
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
for historic horse racing um we do have
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
of course great concern about the way
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
this particular language is worded
 
04:18:21.870 --> 04:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
because we're not convinced that it
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely grandfathers everybody who's
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
has an ongoing investment we would want
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that that language was
 
04:18:34.189 --> 04:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
very carefully reviewed and put into
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
place so that no one not only no one who
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
currently is operating but no one who's
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
currently in let's call it the pipeline
 
04:18:44.590 --> 04:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
and let me explain
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
that this house has passed Senate Bill
 
04:18:52.030 --> 04:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
112 as amended and I believe in your
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
last session you also passed and I don't
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
have the bill number but it was another
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill out of ways and means that had
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
identical language to Senate Bill 112
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
and what those one of the provisions of
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
those two bills was that you extended
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
the current
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium on new facilities for 7 years
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
except there is an exception
 
04:19:19.469 --> 04:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
any uh applicant that's already in the
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
lottery between who appli between
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
January 1 and I think it's October 18th
 
04:19:25.520 --> 04:19:26.389 align:start position:0%
January 1 and I think it's October 18th
of

04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:19:29.550 --> 04:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
2023 those applicants should they end up
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
getting a license would also be eligible
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
for historic Horse Rising as I said that
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
bill no two bills have passed with that
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
l language in it those people even the
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
ones in the application process have
 
04:19:44.189 --> 04:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
made a significant investment going
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
through that very vetted process and we
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
would want to make sure that they and
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
the current game operators are would not
 
04:19:58.030 --> 04:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
come be subject to a a local option um
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
so given that the reality is there's not
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
going to be a flood I now neither bill
 
04:20:09.389 --> 04:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
has become law so we know that I feel
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
fairly confident that that language in
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
some form is going to pass this session
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the governor who has previously
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
vetoed an extension of the moratorium in
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 51 which he did last year
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
has indicated he would sign this new
 
04:20:28.510 --> 04:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
language this new legislation because it
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
took care of businesses that were
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
already investing in the and I don't
 
04:20:36.109 --> 04:20:36.119 align:start position:0%
want to I I I don't have any authority
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
to speak for for the governor but based
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
on his veto message he had said he
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
vetoed Senate Bill 51 because there were
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
other businesses that were already
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
looking into this and he felt they
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
needed to be protected so given all of
 
04:20:53.070 --> 04:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
that I guess our basic testimony is
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
there isn't a need a rush to pass
 
04:20:59.790 --> 04:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
language now the gaming study commission
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
does in fact have this on their agenda
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
in fact they just discussed it on
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
Monday um I know they're going to have
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
further discussions about it and um
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is I believe it appears a support
 
04:21:16.710 --> 04:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the commission to come up with some
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
language that would put a local option
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
in place going forward and as I said as
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
long as the so one last thing it's just
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
so you know so there are 14 original
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
game operator
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
employers um they include Lebanon and
 
04:21:36.109 --> 04:21:36.119 align:start position:0%
Conway and there are we've been told by
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
the Lottery that the potential new
 
04:21:41.149 --> 04:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
applicants that would qualify under the
 
04:21:44.429 --> 04:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
language passed by Senate Bill 112 the
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
total number of that is five that and
 
04:21:49.389 --> 04:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
and and not we don't know if all five
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
will eventually get a license but if
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
they all did you would be looking at 14
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
current and potentially five new
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
facilities so given all of that we just
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
feel like it's um doesn't need to be
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
rushed and we would like uh and we think
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
the wording of this language is
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.630 --> 04:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
areas uh one last thing I would say
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
there is also and this is again I'm not
 
04:22:21.630 --> 04:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
trying to complicate things but like for
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
instance in the town of Salem there is
 
04:22:26.590 --> 04:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
currently a game operator
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
employer but we also know that one of
 
04:22:32.189 --> 04:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
the five applicants is a second game
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
operator employer that would go into
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
Salem and if this bill passed it would
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
appear that the one there now would not
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
need local approval maybe but the second
 
04:22:48.670 --> 04:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
one would and so that again it's just
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
it's a complication it's one of those
 
04:22:52.750 --> 04:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
things that legislation will you get
 
04:22:54.269 --> 04:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
down into the nitty-gritty you got to
 
04:22:56.189 --> 04:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
really work on to make sure that you're
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
doing what you think you want to
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
yell thank you thank you you've
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
convinced me that this is a bad idea but
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
as far as the amendment
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about kind of your
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and how
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
um so historical horse racing is just
 
04:23:21.070 --> 04:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
one of kind of many different games of
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
chance that someone could have and if
 
04:23:25.319 --> 04:23:26.349 align:start position:0%
chance that someone could have and if
you

04:23:26.349 --> 04:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
have that operator license you could
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
choose to do a whole range of them um is
 
04:23:37.590 --> 04:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
is if that is correct the the local
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
option is to just ban one of those those
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
many uh options that that could be used
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
on the floor of that gaming
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
establishment is that my is that correct
 
04:23:52.670 --> 04:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
is that my understanding if the first
 
04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
part of the bill were adopted by a local
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
community the answer to your question is
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
yes the second part of the bill would
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
allow a facil a local community to ban
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
games of chance entirely and just to let
 
04:24:09.870 --> 04:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
me explain a complication in order to
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
have historic horse racing for instance
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
you have to have a game of chance
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
license those are two separate licenses
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
they they have different criteria to
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
apply for let's suppose a community
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
adopted allowing historic horse racing
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
but did not adopt allowing games of
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
chance well then you nobody could have
 
04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing in that Community
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
because they can't have games of chance
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.399 --> 04:24:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:24:43.710 --> 04:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one it's a
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a followup here just so I'm
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
clear is what you're saying
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
is if there's no game of chance license
 
04:24:59.389 --> 04:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
whatever you called it the game operator
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
employer then you cannot have historical
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
correct so really the only local
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
option in your opinion that would need
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
to be in here would be game of the games
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
of chance is that correct if we were to
 
04:25:18.750 --> 04:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
do that well if you were to do it that
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
would work unless a community didn't
 
04:25:23.790 --> 04:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
mind having craps and T and blackjack in
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
their Community but didn't want an
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
electronic game so I understand where
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
representative rord was going and saying
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
we want to do one or the other but you
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
know that's that's what I'm saying the
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of how you get there I
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
think think needs more time understood
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
now thank you um second
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned the mor current
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
moratorium when does that expire the
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
current moratorium expires July 1 of
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
this year and there are now at least
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
three bills one uh is up in the senate
 
04:25:56.950 --> 04:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
in fact tomorrow that would extend that
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
to seven years um and have the same
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
language that you folks have passed in
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
the house allowing these five applicants
 
04:26:12.030 --> 04:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.040 --> 04:26:15.309 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:26:15.309 --> 04:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
okay I think I have one more for you
 
04:26:17.560 --> 04:26:18.349 align:start position:0%
okay I think I have one more for you
hold

04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
hold
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
on so you said that you're not opposed
 
04:26:27.389 --> 04:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
to local option but you don't believe
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
this bill or Amendment does
 
04:26:35.229 --> 04:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
that in very simple terms how what would
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
this have to do or say so you would say
 
04:26:40.349 --> 04:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'm good with the local option well
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
for instance the very first line under
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
28 on line 12 line 13 for facilities
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
permitted after July 1
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
2024 honestly I don't know what that
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
means but I think it I think what it
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
means to say is for a
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
new uh games of chance facility okay
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
that was not otherwise in the pipeline
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
are not otherwise operating but I'm not
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
sure it really clearly states that
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
because for instance even our current
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
facilities would have to get relicensed
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
they C you currently you change the law
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
to make it every three years so in
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
2026 for instance everyone who got
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
licensed last year is going to have to
 
04:27:29.070 --> 04:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
get licensed again would they then come
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
under this section that would be a
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
concern of ours because the way that
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's drafted I think we can get to where
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
they where the sponsor wants to be but
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that particular
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
sentence is the correct one so is that
 
04:27:48.309 --> 04:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.910 --> 04:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
you the ability to repeal is an issue
 
04:27:57.790 --> 04:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
and the language that allows a community
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
to repeal I mean again some of these
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
facilities you June 8th 2021 was the
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
effective date of historic horse racing
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
for instance okay we're now in
 
04:28:18.269 --> 04:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
2024 we're almost three years out and
 
04:28:21.870 --> 04:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
Conway and um
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
Rochester who are
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
original qualifiers are yet to be
 
04:28:30.349 --> 04:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
operating this would allow a town to
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
repeal if a facility didn't operate
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
within 3 years it's taken those those
 
04:28:38.349 --> 04:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
two facilities that long to get up and
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
running and I don't think either of them
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate being up and running before
 
04:28:44.710 --> 04:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
June 8 so they go past the three-year
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
window so in other words you know I
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
think that that would need to be
 
04:28:50.349 --> 04:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
addressed that if somebody was in the
 
04:28:53.229 --> 04:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
process of putting a facility in place
 
04:28:56.070 --> 04:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
they couldn't have a a revote that would
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
take away because you've invested a
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
great deal of money to get to even
 
04:29:02.830 --> 04:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
before you open the
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
doors okay further questions
 
04:29:07.950 --> 04:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
CA and thank you for
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
your uh next we'll call Curtis
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
Meer can we have her go
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
first we're more than happy to have I've
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
only got two more if Deborah would like
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
to go first that's fine Deborah Warner
 
04:29:21.960 --> 04:29:25.429 align:start position:0%
to go first that's fine Deborah Warner
thank

04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.750 --> 04:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
you I very much appreciate this
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
members of this committee um Dr Deborah
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
Warner from Littleton and uh we are
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
folks who were very surprised one day
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
when we had a visit from uh someone who
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to introduce a Cano casino to our
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
community and there was a listening
 
04:29:50.590 --> 04:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
session up at the high school in our
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
town of 6000 more than 100 people came
 
04:29:57.149 --> 04:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
which for us is a lot and um many many
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
people spoke and 95% of the people who
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
got up uh had negative things to say and
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
then there were a few that the other 5%
 
04:30:07.950 --> 04:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
said positive things that they would
 
04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
like a casino in town and uh there was
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of um concern of this and we
 
04:30:19.109 --> 04:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
were told by the town um officials that
 
04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
there was nothing at all we could do
 
04:30:25.510 --> 04:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
about it just listen and see and so um
 
04:30:28.269 --> 04:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
we were pretty disheartened by all of
 
04:30:31.149 --> 04:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
that because of our experiences and such
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
and many people had um negative
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
experiences in their family am and
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
upbringing and socially to uh consider
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
the casino as a positive addition to our
 
04:30:45.870 --> 04:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
really wonderful community that we're
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
very proud of uh Littleton has 6,000
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
people it has 42 restaurants it has
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
20,000 people a day who come uh to our
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
industry and shopping uh it's a
 
04:31:00.429 --> 04:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
happening place and we're quite pleased
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
with it there's a lot of volunteer work
 
04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of community um camaraderie
 
04:31:08.349 --> 04:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
people know each other they care about
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
each other and we take care of each
 
04:31:13.950 --> 04:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
other and so I want to bring forward our
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
concerns on your handout I sent you a
 
04:31:19.870 --> 04:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
passed it around for you all as my name
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
at the top Warner um we ask you to vote
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
to adopt this amendment I understand um
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
there are some issues that perhaps a
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
little wording change could be involved
 
04:31:34.189 --> 04:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
um but that you would adopt it and then
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
put O A to pass as amended uh for the
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um just New Hampshire
 
04:31:44.429 --> 04:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
does things right we try to do new
 
04:31:46.710 --> 04:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
things and we try to do good things and
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
we try to do them right I have been
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
attending the commission to study the
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
chable gambling and in fact I made a
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
presentation to them last month about
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
local option um they're discussing it
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
see what can be done but as you know for
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
Littleton we have a consideration that's
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
right in the wings uh the people
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
involved have told me that they're still
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
in the hopper and they even though the
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
the director has not named them uh they
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
themselves have told us uh that they are
 
04:32:22.189 --> 04:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
in the works in the pipeline um I
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the reason for a moratorium
 
04:32:28.510 --> 04:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
is so that the rules the laws can catch
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
up with gaps that were not fully
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
considered or could not be considered at
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
the first uh round of the new laws and
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
so um I think we need to comprehend the
 
04:32:45.389 --> 04:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
impact of this law the law the rsas are
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
in several places the games of chance
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
and the historic horse rating are in
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
completely separate rsas uh makes it a
 
04:32:57.149 --> 04:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
little difficult to follow and um it was
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
quite a thing touring around that spot
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to consider it those
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
laws all regulate the honest operation
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
of Casino
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
and what the state and would do with the
 
04:33:10.510 --> 04:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
money and where the money goes but
 
04:33:12.670 --> 04:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's no consideration really in that
 
04:33:16.150 --> 04:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
law of the source of that money all of
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
the money of the $170 million that in
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
2023 came in uh to the casinos uh to use
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
and distribute in the ways that are
 
04:33:31.349 --> 04:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
according to the law all of that $170
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
million came out of people's pockets in
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
those locations now they freely gave it
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
it's their risk that they took um but
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are many many consequences and
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
there are many uh things affected by the
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
gambling industry and it's highly
 
04:33:49.709 --> 04:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
associated with addiction being within
 
04:33:54.429 --> 04:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
10 miles of a casino doubles your risk
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
of being a gambling addict that's you
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
know like having any other toxic
 
04:34:03.070 --> 04:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
substance that's nearby it gets
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
regulated and it's a good thing that it
 
04:34:05.949 --> 04:34:05.959 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:34:08.670 --> 04:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
that's not a bigotry you know that's not
 
04:34:13.349 --> 04:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
a it's not a a um a bias against it it's
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
just happens to be facts there are other
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
um reasons why local people might not
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
want to have a casino in their territory
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh but we we need to look at responsible
 
04:34:27.551 --> 04:34:27.561 align:start position:0%
sourcing of the gambling money where's
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
it coming from it's in a community right
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
now the little communities that house
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
the casinos and case it would be a
 
04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
little community and Salem OR Nasha
 
04:34:40.269 --> 04:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
would be a big Community uh but that
 
04:34:44.109 --> 04:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
$170 million is coming out of somewhere
 
04:34:46.109 --> 04:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not going into the local
 
04:34:46.119 --> 04:34:48.949 align:start position:0%
and it's not going into the local
economy

04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
economy
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
um let's see I'm you can read through my
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and and see the various
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
smaller points that are important with
 
04:34:59.869 --> 04:34:59.879 align:start position:0%
this but in terms of how this goes and
 
04:35:04.029 --> 04:35:04.039 align:start position:0%
what is the state's responsibility to
 
04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
something that is significantly
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
impacting a community and that the
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
community has no chance to say yes or no
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's the major question for
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
this committee and I think it's really
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
important if you look at page two you
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
see a graph it is a um a ratio of the
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
revenues over the first four the last
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
four years from 20 through 23 of how
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
much income was uh produced at the
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
casinos it has gone up quite
 
04:35:38.750 --> 04:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
significantly in that period of time and
 
04:35:43.629 --> 04:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
this is a ratio of that to the personal
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
consumption expenditures that's from the
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
um bea.gov uh numbers it's like a gross
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
national product but it's at the the
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
state level and it's about expenditures
 
04:35:57.150 --> 04:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
specifically and so if you made this
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
ratio you can see that it's changing
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
over time very quickly and if you were
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
to look at what will it be in five or 10
 
04:36:06.070 --> 04:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
years it's likely to go up that's wanted
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
to increase the number of places that
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
there are casinos and they're building
 
04:36:11.709 --> 04:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
and so of course numbers like that will
 
04:36:13.789 --> 04:36:13.799 align:start position:0%
be going up and so you look at well if
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
that money is no longer in the local
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
community what happens to the local
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
economy and what happens to the
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
businesses um it is known that it can
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
affect the restaurant industry um
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
because casinos are often
 
04:36:29.949 --> 04:36:29.959 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and have um cheaper food
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
and delicious food and such and people
 
04:36:34.109 --> 04:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
are attracted to that venue for good
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
reasons for that but does have an impact
 
04:36:37.709 --> 04:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
on the local
 
04:36:37.719 --> 04:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
on the local
businesses

04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.910 --> 04:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
um there are negative and positive
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
reasons why people might vote about
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
casinos in terms of the positive and um
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
they might have taxes that they could
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
collect and attractions to the venue and
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
a profitable owner investment selective
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
charitable support there is a big
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
waiting list for Charities to get in on
 
04:37:04.029 --> 04:37:04.039 align:start position:0%
this money by the way it's a lot of
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
money and it's very nice for the
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
Charities who get it by the way there
 
04:37:09.150 --> 04:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
are negative issues that I just
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few minutes
 
04:37:15.150 --> 04:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
ago there is a deep precedence in laws
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
and Zoning that protects the general
 
04:37:18.670 --> 04:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
welfare of the
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
community and that is why alcohol is
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
regulated that's why drugs are regulated
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
and things like that and and there there
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
is reason to know that there can be some
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
very significant health effects and
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
economic and social effects with uh
 
04:37:39.551 --> 04:37:39.561 align:start position:0%
gambling and here especially with
 
04:37:41.789 --> 04:37:41.799 align:start position:0%
casinos there's a lot of research on
 
04:37:46.590 --> 04:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
their impact so in terms of why would
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
the government get involved is that why
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
would a state level decision affect a
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
local community is if you were going to
 
04:37:57.039 --> 04:37:58.709 align:start position:0%
local community is if you were going to
do

04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
um public domain and take over a place
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
and say it's for the public good we need
 
04:38:04.719 --> 04:38:05.551 align:start position:0%
and say it's for the public good we need
this

04:38:05.551 --> 04:38:05.561 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
energy plant and it's going to have to
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
be here and the local preferences often
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
would get overridden in that case
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
however in terms of something that is
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
not for the public good it's it's for
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
the the profit of the investors it's for
 
04:38:27.869 --> 04:38:27.879 align:start position:0%
the state taxes and it's for select
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
Charities um that doesn't meet that
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
threshold in terms of our decision
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
making and so I think is excellent
 
04:38:38.189 --> 04:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
reason for us to put this decision in
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
the local hands it is the people in the
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
community who know the local assets
 
04:38:47.470 --> 04:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
their potentials the treasures their
 
04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
society you know whatever it is that
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
they treasure in their community that
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
they could make that decision and
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's a balance between those
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
positives and negatives and each of us
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
in this room May certainly have a
 
04:39:02.429 --> 04:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
different opinion of where we would vote
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
locally on such a thing and that's part
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
of the real strength of our system that
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
we're able to have dis disagreements
 
04:39:14.109 --> 04:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
we're able to have different opinions
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
and that we look at in the end what does
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
the community decide I think that's a
 
04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
really important part of appreciating
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
the value of local option
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
so responsible sourcing of gambling
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
money is how I'm framing this is because
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
the money does come from somewhere and
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
we need to be barely considerate of
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from and it's coming
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
from the communities it affects the
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
communities and so
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
um we've did copy as you heard the Kino
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
statute and as representative rokford
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
explained uh we made sure that the exit
 
04:39:58.990 --> 04:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
plan if used or and voted on that it's
 
04:40:03.150 --> 04:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
considerate of the Investments made by
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
the the casino company compes themselves
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
and so if those numbers need a little
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
tweaking I don't have a problem with
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
that on the last page of my handout is
 
04:40:13.708 --> 04:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
our story you can read it and have a cup
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
of cocoa and help us out it would be
 
04:40:19.150 --> 04:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
very nice we do have um an urgency for
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
this I I do believe that it's not in the
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
law that the people in the pipeline uh
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
are automatically grandfathered in I
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly like it to be that they
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
are um subject to the new law because it
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
g that's a point of a moratorium is that
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
you try to catch up um with the holes
 
04:40:41.230 --> 04:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
and the gaps that were in the problem in
 
04:40:43.310 --> 04:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
the first place there were some
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions in terms of
 
04:40:46.480 --> 04:40:48.670 align:start position:0%
questions in terms of
um

04:40:48.670 --> 04:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the I don't believe it's written so that
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
they the facilities in place would need
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
to apply for a license all over again I
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
think we we were trying to grandfather
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
them in in the way that we wrote that um
 
04:41:01.868 --> 04:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
but that might need a little bit of
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
tweaking for the HHR or some of those
 
04:41:06.910 --> 04:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
um you know that got an immediate
 
04:41:11.470 --> 04:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
granting of their license at the state
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
level but didn't build yet and it's
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
almost coming up on three years U that's
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
quite understandable if they were
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
already in this before we even thought
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
this of this law that makes sense it
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
does sound also in the way that um the
 
04:41:27.390 --> 04:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
gentleman who's the lobbyist um brought
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
up that point is that uh it could be
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
that the Strategic entry to this local
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
option um consideration might be through
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
the games gaming parlor itself the goe
 
04:41:43.390 --> 04:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
um that it that might be the section
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
that needs to be emphasized and that if
 
04:41:49.470 --> 04:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
the HHR is 100% dependent upon the
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
gaming um operator license and facility
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
that that might be all right to
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate that so that there's not
 
04:42:00.910 --> 04:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
confusion about which one you are voting
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
in or voting out so if those time frames
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
need to change I don't have a problem
 
04:42:08.830 --> 04:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
with that and if we want to consider the
 
04:42:12.910 --> 04:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
impact of taking HHR out of the mix
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
because it's 100% dependent upon that
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
and take your word for that I mean that
 
04:42:20.110 --> 04:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
that really does make sense to me
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
because it would be more strategic it
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
was a very complicated uh thing with
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
these several
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
statutes there were perhaps some other
 
04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
things uh this thing about seven days
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
that she brought up um I that was just
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
from the King know and I think that this
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
committee might want to change that but
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think that this very much is germine
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
to this committee I think that you are
 
04:42:44.910 --> 04:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
the ones who really have the best
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
interests of the communities in the
 
04:42:49.628 --> 04:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
center of your vision and your mission
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
here and so I think it is in the right
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
place I'm very very glad that this is
 
04:42:56.670 --> 04:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
coming to your attention I don't think
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
handling this means that in the future
 
04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
all gambling legislation is going to
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
head your way please don't think that
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
you're opening the gate to a flood of
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
gambling bills but I think that this
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is very very local so thank
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions um I will
 
04:43:22.310 --> 04:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
let the final speaker speak and then I'm
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
just going to make a couple
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.480 --> 04:43:35.310 align:start position:0%
 
Meer

04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
Meer
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
hello I'm the Reverend Curtis Meer I'm
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
from Littleton I really came here to
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
back up Deb but first things is um I
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
wish I could bring you greetings from my
 
04:43:46.510 --> 04:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
mother the representative Katie Meer who
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
was chair of this Committee in 1998
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
she's in heaven now but she would want
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
me to say hello and uh wish courage and
 
04:43:55.948 --> 04:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
fortitude to you all in your work um so
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
basically uh I just wanted to say that
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not against gambling per se I
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm maybe you expected that with
 
04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
this thing around my neck but I I I am
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
sure that I bought the winning lottery
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
ticket yesterday so I'm not against
 
04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
gambling but uh the point of all this
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
and our concern up in Littleton is
 
04:44:14.910 --> 04:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
really about a fixed facility and what
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
that would bring in terms of um human
 
04:44:20.230 --> 04:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
traffic and car traffic and um potential
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
ills in the in the community and we were
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
just very very concerned about that and
 
04:44:27.310 --> 04:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
and knowing about Kino and how there was
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
local option in Kino we thought there
 
04:44:32.270 --> 04:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
would be consistency on principle that
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to gaming because gaming
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
is so fraught uh in debate and and in
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
the public that if Kino little machines
 
04:44:43.948 --> 04:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
in various places was important enough
 
04:44:46.750 --> 04:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
to have local option then why not a
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
whole facility it would seem in Congress
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
or odd to constituents I think to say
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
well they trust us to make the decision
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
about little machines and places but we
 
04:44:58.030 --> 04:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
can't have a say about a whole facility
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
that would impact our community and how
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
it might impact our community so um so I
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
would encourage um a vote for this
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you thank you further
 
04:45:11.310 --> 04:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
comments or
 
04:45:14.510 --> 04:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'm not going to
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
quite close the hearing yet um what I
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
would highly recommend is um you all get
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
together with representative rord who is
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor um maybe even get in contact
 
04:45:32.990 --> 04:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
with Mr Newman here who says he can see
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
away with some changes you you've heard
 
04:45:37.948 --> 04:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
about all the potential downfalls on
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
this I think if it has um the ability to
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
go through it's going to take some
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
changes um so maybe you all can work
 
04:45:48.470 --> 04:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
together get uh representative roord
 
04:45:51.628 --> 04:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
involved with that
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
um we are getting close to the end of
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
our house session or
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
our before our crossover bills we've got
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
very limited time remaining so I would
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
highly recommend if you intend to make
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
some changes or representative rfor
 
04:46:10.750 --> 04:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
wants to make some changes that it's
 
04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
done very rapidly so I will leave it at
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
that Mr Newman's there you can uh talk
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
with him about it we as a committee I do
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
not believe are going to get involved
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
with major major rewrites of this that's
 
04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
not going to be uh our responsibility so
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
just so everybody's under on the same
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
page does that make sense
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we'll close the
 
04:46:43.270 --> 04:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.600 --> 04:46:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

04:46:54.190 --> 04:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
call Mr
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%

04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
remaining exec bills are all scheduled
 
04:47:09.548 --> 04:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
for Monday um but that's leaving us the
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
following Wednesday for anything that
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%

04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:33.080 --> 04:48:57.788 align:start position:0%
