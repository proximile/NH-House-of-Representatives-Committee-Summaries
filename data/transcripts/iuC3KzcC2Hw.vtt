00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
discussion matter is before us but
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
before we start that work session we
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
have some announcements that we want to
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
discuss with the
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee after we finish the work
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
session by the way there will be a
 
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
republican caucus in this room and then
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
we'll have a lunch break and then we'll
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
be back here at 1:00 for an executive
 
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
session so last week we had uh some
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
discussion about the proper way
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
motion on a bill that we want to amend
 
00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 align:start position:0%
and then how to move the amendment and
 
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
how to vote on the
 
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and I suggested at the time
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have to vote on the
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and some people questioned
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
that so I went to the clerk and had an
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
extensive conversation with
 
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
him and this has a subject that had come
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
up several times before in fact the
 
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
clerk had had uh a discussion about it
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a chairs and vice chairs meeting
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
and at that
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
meeting he did state that you do not
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
have to have a roll call on an amendment
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
you can vote on an amendment with a show
 
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.749 align:start position:0%
you can vote on an amendment with a show
of

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
hands and there was a bunch of back and
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
forth discussion after he made that
 
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.150 align:start position:0%
forth discussion after he made that
statement

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
and it got confusing after a
 
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.309 align:start position:0%
and it got confusing after a
while

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I came away from the discussion
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
thinking that we did not have to vote on
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment based on the different
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
threads that emerged during that
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
discussion so the clerk clarified for me
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
last week that we do have to vote on an
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendment it can be a roll call Vote or
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
it can be a show of hands I think you
 
00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 align:start position:0%
can even do a v Voice vote if you want
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
but you do have to vote on the amendment
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
so going forward we will always vote on
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
an amend Amendment separately and then
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
vote on the motion of ought to pass as
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
amended Vice chair
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes thank you Mr chair I think
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
and and to that end regardless of how
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's done I believe the clerk still has
 
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
to check off each box for each member as
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
how they voted so um however we do it I
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
believe it it needs to be recorded on on
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
Mr clerk uh do you concur with that
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
observation that is consistent with the
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
training that I originally had uh two
 
00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
training that I originally had uh two
years

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
ago so if it was a vote by a show of
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
hands people would have to hold their
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
hand up long enough for you to actually
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
go through and check off each member's
 
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
go through and check off each member's
vote

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
Yes okay so if we do do a voice not a
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
voice but a show of hands
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
vote I will try to remind everybody to
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
keep your hand raised until the clerk
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
indicates that he has recorded your vote
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
appears yes as long as we see
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
everybody's hand we we'll have to ask
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
everybody to raise their hand at that
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
point so are there any additional
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative parshall thank you chair
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
I think this a a softball question but
 
00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
what is the status of this particular
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
bill right now are we going to bring the
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
bill back to executive committee for a
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
vote or is it uh are that's looking
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
towards the future so the clerk said
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
that the bills that we exec last week
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
are good to go even though we didn't do
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the process correctly they're still good
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
to go because there was nothing terribly
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
controversial about about any of the
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
bills so we don't have to redo the ones
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
we already did we just have to do it
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
correctly going
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
forward okay now representative Bernardi
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
has been working to put together a trip
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
to ISO New England and he would like to
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
talk to you about
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you Mr chair uh I think
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
most folks saw my email and I have uh
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
confirmation from several people that
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
they are interested in going and
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you uh first of all it's um
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not going to be taking the
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
van so if it's uh a a question of do we
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
need a larger van because I'm going to
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
be there probably I won't be in in the
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
van driving separately uh the one thing
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'd really be curious to see it's not so
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
much um the hardware but i' I'd be
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
auction representative Thomas
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm interested in hearing
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
about any nuclear oversight that they
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
may be doing thank
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
you representative lii uh thank you um
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
depending on conditions with the van it
 
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
may be better for me to go separately
 
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm already South and U it might
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
be you know if the van's going to be
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
packed then it' be easier if I do go
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
separately representative McGee concurs
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
with that um um Vice chair Thomas uh yes
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh at the risk of opening up a
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
can of worms um in in the in the past if
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
you have specific questions uh of iso
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
New England in the past they have asked
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
us to forward those questions to them as
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
soon as possible so that they can
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
address them either once they're there
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
or experience shows that sometimes it
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
takes them a lot longer to respond to
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
those questions but in either case if
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
you have a specific question I would
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
suggest maybe you funnel it to
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi and maybe we can
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
get with um their contact point and for
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
and saying here's things that we're
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
interested in and just see what they say
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's that would that would be that
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to handle it prior
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
to waiting you know before just waiting
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
until we got there so that might be
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
helpful so just to recap on those who
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
may not take the van Representatives
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
Corman McGee licki and Wendy
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas and you're going down Route three
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
right we're going to Holy Oak mass
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
there well if you're going to do that
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
okay maybe you could uh circulate as
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
soon as you find out where where the van
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
is going yeah let people know so that
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
people could decide yes or no on the van
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
yep all
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
right and what day is this trip again 12
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
March 12 March isn't that town meeting
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
day yes it
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
is that's going to be a problem for
 
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.310 align:start position:0%
is that's going to be a problem for
me

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
well it is what it is right so the
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
well it is what it is right so the
time

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
so given the the length of that trip I'd
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
say it's going to be a pretty early
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
morning start like 8 a.m. and probably
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
not returning to the L till 5:00 a.m. or
 
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.430 align:start position:0%
not returning to the L till 5:00 a.m. or
5:00

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
p.m. might not be able to vote right
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
well that's true that's why I I
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
well do you want to consider
 
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I I can do that I can I can check see
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether another date's possible okay has
 
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.629 align:start position:0%
whether another date's possible okay has
it

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
always has it already been noticed in
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
the calendar no it has not been noticed
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
in the calendar I just I just asked that
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
it be noticed this morning so it hasn't
 
00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:49.710 align:start position:0%
it be noticed this morning so it hasn't
happened

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
yet all
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
right okay so the basic issue here is
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
that this trip is being
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
planned the planning is not maybe
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
complete yet so we will continue to work
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
on that just uh pay attention to rep
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard's emails if you
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
trip

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
trip
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh Vice chair Thomas do you have
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
any other information about any upcoming
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
presentations or anything uh only that
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're working uh for presentations or I
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
should say representative Berard will be
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
working with for presentations with
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and depart and
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
those the only two things that we
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
currently are are looking at right now I
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
first

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
right anything else on this
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
subject all right let's get to work then
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
on our full committee work session we're
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
going to talk about three bills this
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
morning House Bill 1644 FN requiring the
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
department of energy to initiate an
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
investigation of the benefits and key
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
considerations regarding support for
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
clean or non-carbon emitting power
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
generation HB 1465 relative to studies
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
of nuclear energy Technologies and hb1
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
1431 relative to utility requirements
 
00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.230 align:start position:0%
1431 relative to utility requirements
for

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution planning
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes over here representative
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
Ms could I could I ask that we um that
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
we put HB 1465 to the end of the list
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
because uh there's an amendment that
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
should be available within the next half
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
hour 45
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
minutes sure thank you not a
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
problem but we will start with HB 1644
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
FN and I am passing out right at this
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.949 align:start position:0%
 
2024-the

00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
2024-the
 
00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:14.670 align:start position:0%
2024-the
that

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
the the original version of the bill was
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
to convert our renewable portfolio
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
standard into a zero emission portfolio
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
standard and I actually had the language
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
RPS and then I abandoned that draft
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
because it couldn't make it work
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
financially and went with the draft that
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
was subsequently filed as the bill as
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
introduced since that time the
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
Connecticut legislature has added RPS to
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
its I mean added nuclear to its RPS
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
using using language that's virtually
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
identical to what I've uh proposed in
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
to hb1 1644 so this amendment would
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
replace the entire
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
Bill and change the name of the
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
that after September 1st of 2024 any
 
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.390 align:start position:0%
that after September 1st of 2024 any
newly

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
newly
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.950 align:start position:0%
newly
built

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear power generating facility that
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
commenced operation would be eligible
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
Rex now what this bill does is it hangs
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
out a sign that says New Hampshire is
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
open for business when it comes to
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy obviously there are no
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear power
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
plants currently being proposed or built
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so this would not
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
affect the
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
RPS at any point in the foreseeable
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
future but what it would do is it would
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
send a signal that should somebody
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
decide that maybe New Hampshire is a
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
good place to build a nuclear
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
facility that the state is open to
 
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.789 align:start position:0%
facility that the state is open to
supporting

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
it so that's why I'm proposing this
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
amendment it's a fairly simple Amendment
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
as you can see and I'm interested in
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
your reactions to it
 
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.590 align:start position:0%
your reactions to it
representative

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman um I think
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's well-intentioned
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
um my
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
concern off just you know off the cuff
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
in reviewing it when we received it
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday was that um this hasn't
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
been uh an addition
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
to a class which is uh new renewable
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
right class one um it hasn't been
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
studied in in terms of economic impact
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
to your point there wouldn't be an
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
immediate inter impact but you would
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
also be setting up um multiple classes
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
of nuclear right so there would be an
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
advantage to any new nuclear plants and
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
you know the existing nuclear plant
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
would be playing on a different playing
 
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
field uh as would all the other
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
renewable Generations so I think it's
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
something that really has to be studied
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
before we put it into law um and say
 
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
that we can pronounce a solution based
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
on on what another state has arrived at
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
without us really understanding the
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
impact um economically basically on our
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
energy sources
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
discussion Vice chair Thomas thank you
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I I like the amendment I I
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
think it does exactly what the chair uh
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
says it's supposed to do do um true if
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
and when um someone ever became
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
interested in coming to New Hampshire I
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
think at that time we could easily um
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
submit something else that could say uh
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
we we need to maybe study something uh
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
that would um to make sure that we've
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
had all the te's cross eyes dotted but I
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
think to get us off the board right now
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good Amendment if we
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
want to come back next year with
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
something to add to it we perhaps could
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Corman thank
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm I'm a little
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with with uh placing
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear power as a renewable source um I
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't view it really as renewable it
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
requires a fuel that is is mined and
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
processed it I I don't see it as
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
renewable um I also have a slight
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
concern about the amount of power that
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
nuclear can produce swamping some of the
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
things that we do consider renewable in
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
that class um and I'm not against
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
nuclear but I I I I do have a a a small
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
concern about that um I recognize that
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
most likely any nuclear facility that uh
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
that arises in New Hampshire will
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
probably be much smaller scale than what
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
we have now uh so I'm I I don't know how
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
well-founded that concern is but I
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
wonder if it might make sense to to try
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
to put some cap on the size of a nuclear
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
facility uh that that would actually get
 
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.549 align:start position:0%
facility uh that that would actually get
the

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
reck so you might be suggesting that
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
small nuclear or small modular
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
reactors uh might be appropriate but a
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
large reactor might not that that's
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
right and and I don't really think we're
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
going to see any new large reactors but
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
know correct representative licki H
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um there is an
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
issue with small nuclear plants of uh
 
00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
essentially uh uh scale basically
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overhead that you're
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
going to need you're going to need a
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
whole different kind of security and so
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
forth on a nuclear plant than you would
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
on a uh fossil fuel plant or many other
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
things and so you know there may be a a
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
real issue if uh you know if for
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
instance the you know if you had a 100
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
megawatt nuclear plant it wouldn't be
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
worth building because of those uh
 
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:39.070 align:start position:0%
worth building because of those uh
overhead

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
overhead
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
issues representative
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
rols thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to add um my I have a
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
similar concern as my colleague um
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman with defining
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy as
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
renewable um I don't agree that it's
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
renewable um so however I'm not
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
anti-nuclear I
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm I'm open and looking
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the emergence of uh
 
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.950 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the emergence of uh
small

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor technology uh as a
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
potential answer to the climate problem
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
um but I would
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
be I'm essentially supportive of of your
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
effort here um if if perhaps we made it
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
a separate
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh somehow I know it's called the
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard but um some
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
way distinguishing it um I'm opposed to
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
applying the label renewable to nuclear
 
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
applying the label renewable to nuclear
representative

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
just had uh maybe two comments one one
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
is you know when we talk about renewable
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
um we have to keep in mind that solar
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
panels and wind turbines do not last
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
forever they break down they turn into
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
junk you know after about 25 or 30 years
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
and they have to be scrapped and new
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
ones have to be built the second thing
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
is um the fuel requirements for nuclear
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
reactors is extremely low it almost
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't add any cost to the electricity
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's a capital cost and and the
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
workforce that maintain the plant you
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
know that's where most of the costs come
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
from uh and the the second comment I had
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
is since we started to talk about small
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
modular reactors um I thought I'd
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
promote my favorite right now um I I was
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
always a fan of General Electrics
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
economics simplified Boiling Water
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
Reactor I thought that was maybe the
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
best design in the world um it's never
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
been built but recently General Electric
 
00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
um decided to get on the SMR bandwagon
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
and they have a scaled down version of
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
The Boiling Water Reactor it's the B RW
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
no boiling pwx
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
300 so it's a 300 megawatt electric
 
00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
300 so it's a 300 megawatt electric
output

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
output
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
reactor um you know and a side thing we
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
talked about bow a little bit you know
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know how we would make
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
the politics and Economics work but if
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
you wanted to drop in as that Bill said
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
a clean reliable source of electricity
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know that wouldn't be a bad thing
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
and the last comment I would make is
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
that uh right now General Electric has a
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
contract to build I think two of these
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
at Darlington um another aside I used to
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
swim at the Darlington Beach in the
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
coolant water
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
basically um but anyway so this is this
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
has gotten past the point of you know
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
unicorns and and whatnot so you know
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to build one and
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
Saskatchewan is also you know in kind of
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
late discussions on uh you know building
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
one of these reactors so those are just
 
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
two comments uh relative to what we're
 
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.950 align:start position:0%
two comments uh relative to what we're
talking

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
about thank you Vice chair Thomas thank
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I understand what some of our
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
concerns are here with this amendment
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps there might be room to make
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
an adjustment um perhaps um before we
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
exec this bill but I would appeal to the
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee members that we need to start
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
telling people through our actions that
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
clean energy nuclear is going to be very
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
important in in the future as we uh
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
gravitate to more of the Renewables
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
whatever class we want to call it in and
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
I think this amendment would show people
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
they will begin to see that we
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
are gravitating towards uh at least
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
entertaining the idea of of having
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
nuclear back in the state at some time
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
in the future if it ever comes but more
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
importantly it will tell industries that
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
at least we're open as the chair has
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
said I think this bill this this
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I think would be key to
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
putting that forward into the future so
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
however way we can maybe arrange this so
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we can get this through committee I
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
think would be very important for a
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
message and further work I'm sure I'm
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
positive would be done at at the Senate
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
level so um I believe this amendment is
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
very important if we can do some tweaks
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
with it to get it through here that's
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
fine but I um uh but I think it's
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
important that we get this through in
 
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.789 align:start position:0%
important that we get this through in
some

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
manner representative
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington um yeah uh first of all I
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
think we shouldn't get too excited one
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
way or the other about this bill because
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
no one's going to be building a nuclear
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
plant New Hampshire in at least 10 years
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
if even then as as I've said before uh
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're not a vertically integrated State
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
and and most plans looking at that are
 
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated states where the
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
rate payers would take some of the risk
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
of building a nuclear plant we also have
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
a history of anti-nuclear activism in
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
this in this state so uh when I hear the
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
head of nuclear at Duke Energy say
 
00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to wait 5 to 10 years
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be first and
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
they have a huge Fleet of nuclear plants
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
with nuclear expertise and in vertically
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
integrated State and in a state that's
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
states that have said they like nuclear
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
power I just don't see it happening here
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
so let's not get too excited about if we
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
were to do it to put it out there to say
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're interested in nuclear
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
if you want to think about it it does no
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
harm and I wouldn't be concerned about
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
it being mixed up with renewable and
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
non-renewable because effectively it's
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything and if 10 years
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
or 15 years from now something had to be
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted we could adjust it then but I
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
think basically now it's just a sign
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
saying hey we're interested in nuclear
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
other states have been doing certain
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
things I think it was Illinois uh passed
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
a bill that said they got rid of the
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
prohibition on nuclear new nuclear power
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
plants and of course Connecticut doing
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
this and there's been a few other states
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing so I I just I I
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get too hung up on it but uh it
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't do any harm representative
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
parial thank you chair uh in response to
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
earlier comments about uh the non-
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
renewability of solar and wind what
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is not the energy
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
there we're talking about the devices
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
that we use to collect those that energy
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
and for that matter nuclear has has an
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
even more severe problem and that we
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
really have not totally solved what
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing with the waste so that's one
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
of my concerns to characterize this as
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
being you know solar doesn't work
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
because panels we out nuclear doesn't
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
work because plants were out uh also I'm
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
thinking I I I also wholeheartly agree
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
with uh representative
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
Herrington um and that this is not
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
something on the horizon and I think
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
that we have lots of time to get our
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
sign hung out for New Hampshire if we
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
see this is the direction we're going
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
and lastly I know there are several
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about lithium Mining and the
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
conditions that upon which lithium is
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
mined and I'm thinking that Cobalt
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
mining which has been going a lot longer
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
is not that much better it uses the same
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
comes from the same parts of the of
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
Planet such as the Congo and uh it uses
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
the same labor force which is
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
questionable there that's the issues
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
that I have have right now thank you
 
00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:31.830 align:start position:0%
that I have have right now thank you
representative

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair uh just a
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
comment on that on the renewability
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
concept or and the of fuel uh for power
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
plants um nuclear
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
plants one of the advantages of uh the
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
smallscale fast flux reactors is they
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
can use a reprocessed fuel from one of
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
the large thermal reactors as potential
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
fuel source so the concern of of uh what
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
do we do with the long-term waste of a
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
large thermal plant can be remediated by
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
using that as the fuel source in a fast
 
00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:15.549 align:start position:0%
using that as the fuel source in a fast
flux

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
flux
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
reactor uh that although not a renewable
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
resource representative Kaplan
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I I agree with a
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
lot of what's been said here I think
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
nuclear has potential and and we should
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
not uh shun it you know instinctively
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
because of our fears um of uh the you
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
know past technologies that are being
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
improved um however I I do agree with
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative parall that you know we
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
are in no hurry and that why are we
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
intent on sending a signal which at best
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
is problematic because of of the
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
possible distortions in in the to the to
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy portfolio renewable
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard program I I think
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
that those possible distortions are
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
fairly obvious given the different uh
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
sorts of Technology involved as
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Corman pointed out uh so
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
why would we send a a flawed signal like
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
that um when there's no
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
hurry well in response to you
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan and I appreciate
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
the those comments I would say I would
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
argue that there we are in a hurry if
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to take 10 or more years to
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
get one of these plants built we have to
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
send a signal that it's time to start
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
now and we have a serious reliability
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
problem that we're facing particularly
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
in the New England region it's it's a
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
Countrywide problem but it's even more
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
acute here than it is anywhere else and
 
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:55.430 align:start position:0%
acute here than it is anywhere else and
I

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
think time is is short to find a
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
solution to keeping our lights on going
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
forward and if we can indicate that
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're as a state open and encouraging of
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
the development of nuclear power I think
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
we need to send that message and send it
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later who's
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
next representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
chair um I have two points one is on the
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
current uh discussion that's going on
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
where you said that this sends a message
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
quote New Hampshire is open for business
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
um that to me ring rings all kinds of
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
bells I mean so we're not we haven't
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
studied this we haven't set up any kind
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
of guard rails and we're saying come and
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
build your nuclear plants in New
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that that's really
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
problematic um number two is that this
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill has a fiscal note attached to it so
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
does does this amendment alter that
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note in any way yes it eliminates
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
it invalidates it I should say thank you
 
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
it invalidates it I should say thank you
representative

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chair um and um just
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge what you had said when
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
you introduced the amendment I did go on
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
the um state of Connecticut's website
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
and um you know that that that act did
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
was passed and uh it was nuclear was
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
added to the class one renewable
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
standard as of October 1st of
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
2023 um but to um follow up on
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Corman and reel's point
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I did notice is
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
that in Connecticut the class one um
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
percentage Target um after 2030 is
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
40% compared to New Hampshire's 15% um
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm I'm wondering whether you
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
know if we were to pass this whether
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
that we should also adjust the the
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standards um for
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
class one to reflect the fact that
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're you we would be introducing this
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
new technology that could end up
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
producing a a significant amount of
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
power a legitimate
 
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
concern and one of the reasons why we
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
referred for interim study a bill that
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier this year filed by
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington to consider
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
the future of the RPS right now the way
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
the statute is written after
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
2025 there's no projection of what the
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
future of the RPS might look like and
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
that is something that we need to
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
consider going
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
forward but I don't think we should wait
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
to indicate to the world that we think
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear is important representative
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
liwicki thank you Mr chairman uh we're
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
all over the map here and I figure this
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
might be an appropriate Point time to go
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
further a field but one of the
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
things uh one of the issues is uh
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
thorium basically in my mind thorium
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
they say it's radioactive but in reality
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's just fishable and there's
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
effectively an infinite amount of that
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
and the daa product is I believe an
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
isotope inner isotope of lead rather
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
than U being radioactive itself so you
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
on uh Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh can I have can I ask the the
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy a
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
question sure if the department is
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
willing to answer it's a short
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.430 align:start position:0%
willing to answer it's a short
question

00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman Griffin
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
robers uh Department of energy you know
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
who I am sorry uh in in in um reference
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
to the uh the concern posed by uh uh
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas earlier if this
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass this year could there
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
be a nuclear plant built in the next
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
year or the year after or even within
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
three years just by coming in here and
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
starting it sure thank you for the
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
question uh I'd say that's a
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
hypothetical I guess I'm not sure but
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
developing nuclear resources certainly
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
does take time um so I'm not aware of
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
any specific plans to site any new
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
nuclear resources in the state the next
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
year or two or three and and follow and
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
so therefore through licensing processes
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
and and and and and so forth there would
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
be uh quite a bit of a time lag there
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
where during that time period uh certain
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
things could could be studied before
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
they even even thought about starting
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
here would would that be your assessment
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee do you have a
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
question for
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
no anybody have a question for Mr robers
 
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.150 align:start position:0%
no anybody have a question for Mr robers
representative

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I mean thank you Mr robers
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
question what do you have can you
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
foresee any potential impacts of adding
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
new nuclear technology to the renewable
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard on the other
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy uh sources getting
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits sure um you
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
know obviously I you know the a lot of
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
these questions are hypotheticals I
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
can't predict what would happen but you
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
know um nuclear resources do produce
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of generation obviously
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of anything that's
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
produced in the future um you know there
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
is the potential um there for new
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
resources coming in to crowd without
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
other resources within class
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
one any other questions for Mr
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
Roberge representative partiall I'm
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
getting drawn in s go ahead thanks I
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
could say how how about those Chiefs but
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh I won't go there
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
um how will this how do you foresee this
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
affecting our current market uh with our
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
current use of uh the seabook basically
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
will this have any uh positive or NE
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the maintenance of
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
that plant sure and thank you for the
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
question so based on the language that
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm really just seeing um
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is this would allow new
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
nuclear power generating facilities that
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
became operational after September 1 of
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
2024 um I do not anticipate C Brook
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to take part in this um
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
under this in take part in the RPS under
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment as it is an existing
 
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.390 align:start position:0%
this amendment as it is an existing
generation

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.950 align:start position:0%
generation
facility

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
you have a question for Mr robers I do
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead thanks um thank you Mr
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
robers for taking my question good
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
morning um so my question is how much
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
Rex actually um go for at this point in
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
other words if we had you know a 300
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
megawatt plant that ended up having
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
output capacity that dwarfs all other
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
Renewables that are in the that new
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
category um they would likely be taking
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
most of if not all of the recks but I
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how much of an incentive it
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually is because I don't think the
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
recks in the state are very valuable at
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
this point so I'd like to know what a
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
wreck is worth at this point sure and
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so and how
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
many of them are in circulation because
 
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think we know that either sure
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
so some of that information is in an
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
annual report um that we kick out every
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
year um if it's helpful I can find the
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
page and forward it along after um after
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to talk internally as to
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
what the current kind of going prices
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
for class one Rex um it's not something
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
I oh sorry um I don't know off the top
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
of my head that's something I need to
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
dig a little bit deeper in and follow up
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
with the K by an email if that's all
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
right and follow up um and how many are
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
there like how does that get determined
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
because I know it's in the reporting but
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think we know it off the top of
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
our heads and I don't either so but I I
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
know that that number is in the report
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
and I can find that number and follow up
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
with the committee yep thank
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.829 align:start position:0%
with the committee yep thank
you

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
you have a question for Mr Roberge or or
 
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.390 align:start position:0%
you have a question for Mr Roberge or or
another

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
comment okay representative Thomas thank
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair um Mr robers can
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
you tell us what are the guard rails for
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
any new nuclear builds and is that under
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
your office or is it under Dees and
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
what's to keep a new nuclear plant from
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
becoming the new St gobain of New
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure so thank you for the
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
question so for any new nuclear facility
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
there there are a number of permits that
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
I imagine that facility might need such
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
as say uh going through Dees permitting
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
Nation uh nuclear Regulatory Commission
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
that type of thing I'm certainly not an
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
expert on every single permit that um
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
such a resource would need
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah again it it is kind of a
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetical I can't predict what the
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
future might hold um but I imagine yes
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
permitting will be requ IR ired for any
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
type of permit that comes on in the
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Kennedy question for
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
not okay okay representative Harrington
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
a question for Mr robers well actually
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
more of a followup to his question as
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
far as the permitting goes it's
 
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
exclusive purview of the NRC to license
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear plants in the United States
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's completely Federal but there
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
are various permits that are involved
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
from the state Dees would be involved if
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
there was a water discharge permit for
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
example uh usually there's a coolant
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
system involved they'd be involved in
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
that if there was any air emissions a
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
lot of these plants have a diesel
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
generator emergency diesel generator
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
associated with it um and also they may
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
even have something else to uh what they
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
use to start up that would involve uh
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
air discharge so there are some state
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
permits but the biggest one is going to
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
be the NRC first the design has to be
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
licensed uh by the NRC and then there's
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
a specific license that would have to be
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
granted for the construction and
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
operation of a plant by the NRC again
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
and that takes multiple years to
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
get all right I'm going to cut it off
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
there and let you go because I think we
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
need to wrap up this discussion here
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly we've got two other bills
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
need work session I was trying to get a
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
comment in before okay what is your
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
quick comment please yeah so I just
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh mention we we've discussed
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
a number of different nuclear
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
technologies I read an article this
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
weekend on um the viability of pulling
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
uranium from the ocean which is would be
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
would make nuclear renewable so they are
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
working on that but in its current state
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
the types of reactors that are currently
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
Allowed by the NRC for permitting are
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
not considered renewable and so although
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has gone this way and I
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
don't know their decision- making was I
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
still think for my point that I made
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
with Mr
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
robar um Rex would not be a significant
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
incentive for something as expensive as
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
bringing in a nuclear reactor right that
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
it would be the offset to the kind of
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
cost that would be involved would be
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
very minimal so I don't think that this
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
is the nod to say that we're um look
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
interested in nuclear I don't think that
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
this is going to assist in any way but
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
it will red Define what we interpret to
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
be renewable in the state and I and I
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's a good idea and
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it will be helpful to
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
the RPS so I would like to recommend
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we either is this or we itl this
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
and we let um representative
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington's bill for interim study on
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
where the RPS is moving be a place where
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
we have this discussion because I don't
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
think the bill is ready to become law
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's just that's how I see it thank
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
you did you have one more comment
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy I see your hand
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
up I would have a many comments about
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
all right so you don't okay you're gonna
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to stand down all right
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
let's move on then and
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh have a discussion about HB
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
1431 we have a couple of amendments for
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
that representative Kaplan has an
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
amendment let's talk about his Amendment
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
first um the amendment
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
so uh what I'm passing out now Mr chair
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
is a slight modification on my original
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment so it's basically cleaning it
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
up a little bit so are you passing out
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
0609 H I believe so yeah so what I'm
 
00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
passing out is 0609 H okay I also have
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
20 copies of it here I don't know why I
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
have all these copies okay if anybody
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
out there would like a copy of this
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment we have lots up here so please
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
come get one for a very reasonable
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
now so I mean I'd like to go through the
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
changes on this amendment from the
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
original Amendment which I shared at the
 
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.870 align:start position:0%
original Amendment which I shared at the
public

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so there's basically three
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
changes on this new
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the first one is that uh
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
the word transmission has been taken out
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay so everywhere
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
the the word transmission occurred in
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
the original amendment is is now just
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
reads distribution okay so we're just
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
talking about distribution lines not
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
transmission lines because the feedback
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
was pretty consistent that transmission
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
lines are a federal prerogative and
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
don't belong in the puc's domain so took
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
out transmission line transmission lines
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
from the equation
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the second change that occurs is on
 
00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.109 align:start position:0%
the second change that occurs is on
page

00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
two line 36 and it's in it's talking
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
about the enforceability mechanism of
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
this integrated plan Bill and uh I added
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
the word Distribution on line 36 so it
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
says it reads now no distribution rate
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
change shall be approved uh in the case
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
where there's no plan on file so we we
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
heard feedback from Mr Fran that that
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
would be a red flag if uh if the default
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
rate cases were impacted by by this
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism so took out the default rate
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
cases from the equation and now it's
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
just distribution rate changes that was
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
that uh can cannot be approved if
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
file okay that's it no there's one
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's one more
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
page line 30 line uh 26 sorry I've added
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
in at the behest of the community power
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
Coalition people uh added in competitive
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
choice of electricity suppliers
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with RSA
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
374f uh as uh into the list of things
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
that need to be included in the plan so
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's offering the option of
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
considering the growth of community
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
power and the impact that that would
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
have on on their planning on the
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
planning of the utilities so those are
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm Sor oh yeah that the
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
original Amendment also added gas so
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
that still that still is in here the
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
that gas lines or the gas utilities are
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
included can you please go over the
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
first okay change thank you uh
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan questions
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas yes can you just
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that the first change that you
 
00:49:25.079 --> 00:49:26.030 align:start position:0%
clarify that the first change that you
mentioned

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
regarding transmission yeah okay well on
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh there every time there was the word
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
distribution there also
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
occurred and transmission so now the
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
word transmission has been taken out you
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
won't see that in this
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
amendment okay so for instance on line
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
15 submission of integrated electric
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
distribution plans to the commission
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
originally that read distribution and
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
transmission plans
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've taken out transmission
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
equation additional questions for
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan representative
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
McGee I didn't have a question um for
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan I I wanted to just
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of context as well
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
because um this amendment is trying to
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
address language that was removed uh
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
last session when we passed HB
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
281 and that was the least cost
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning statute at
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
the time of the Senate hearing um we
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
were looking at sort of an Omnibus Bill
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
with five different bills that were
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
pulled together one of those sections
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
was to repeal um the least cost
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning and at that
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
time um a discussion was had that the
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
definition um of New Hampshire energy
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
policy which appears under 378
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
837 uh was not something that we wanted
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
to repeal with everything else and it it
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
would have in its state so we the bill
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
was amended to ensure that that language
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
which appears in this amendment from
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
line nine to line
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
14 um with I guess there were some
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
modifications in there I don't know you
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
could probably speak to that they were
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the original Amendment you had you
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
had changed that updated that language
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
but what it does is um it preserves what
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
we were discussing in those hearings in
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
terms of the energy policy statement uh
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
that's been on the books for a long time
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so uh this particular
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment um goes further in that it
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
takes the other subsections which were
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated altogether and brings back
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
the language that actually requires uh
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
our Regulators to be looking at um
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
long-term planning and integrated
 
00:51:57.789 --> 00:51:57.799 align:start position:0%
planning which is probably more
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
important than ever because as the
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
system is changing and getting more
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
complex um you know it's really
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
important that The Regulators understand
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
what the utilities are doing and that
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
the utilities be able to explain how
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
they're keeping costs low for people so
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
even though it's not called a least cost
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning statute
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
anymore it is still uh the way it's
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
written here devoted to the idea of of
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
pushing least cost or or cost impacts
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed in those in those
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh proceedings so I just wanted to put
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
some context around why the bill where
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
the bill came from and
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
um for your consideration that's
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
all okay further discussion now I know
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
that during the public hearing on this
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
bill there was some mentioned
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
that gas
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
utility regulation is not under the
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
control of the Pu
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
and it may not be appropriate in this
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
that I I don't recall those comments
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
being made Mr chair to be
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
honest was it just transmission yeah
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
transmission was an issue okay correct
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right I don't have my notes right in
 
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.470 align:start position:0%
all right I don't have my notes right in
front

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately all right further
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Harrington I
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
had a couple of questions on the on the
 
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.990 align:start position:0%
had a couple of questions on the on the
bill

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be let me just read it and know
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
um if you go to line 12 it talks about
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
the various things that the state's
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
utilities while providing for says the
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
use of cost effective Energy Efficiency
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
and other demand side
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
resources protection of the safe uh
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
safety and health of the citizens and
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
finally physical environment of the
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
state and the future supplies of
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
resources well the first thing I guess
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'd comment on there there's nothing
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
about coste Effectiveness as as far as
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
rates go it just talks about coste
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
effective use of costeffective Energy
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um I don't know what the
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
future supplies of resources implies but
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
later on when you go down to line 18 it
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
does talk about necessary to improve
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness so could you clarify
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah I mean I think uh thank you
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
for the thank you for the comment
 
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.230 align:start position:0%
for the thank you for the comment
representative

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington I think when it comes to the
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness in in the uh energy
 
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
policy definition on you know 3 378 call
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
37 uh
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
that when you look at the language
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
around Financial stability of the
 
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
around Financial stability of the
state's

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
utilities you know the whole the whole
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism of of the of the rate changes
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
is to guarantee the financial stability
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the utilities and that is
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
included pretty much up front as a first
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
principle okay so it is included in
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
there reasonable and fair electric and
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
gas rates that consider the financial
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
stability of the state utilities I I I
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
find that a pretty clear statement of
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
the need to take care of the utilities
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
and their business
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
model including the rate
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
case any more
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
questions what followup go ahead what is
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
the future supplies of resources implied
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
at the very last part of line 14 yeah I
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean you don't have a picture of that
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
neither do I because it's in the future
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
um but I think that has to do you know
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
the way I read that it has to do with
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
diversity of of uh of energy resources
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
to try to minimize risk going forward
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
and so that's how I read it anyways
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
future supplies of resources means we
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
need to think about the future and what
 
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
resources are in the basket of resources
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
that we have at the moment and you know
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
how that's going to look going forward
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
so when you s resources you're talking
 
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
about uh generation and uh demand
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
reduction yeah okay so I'm I'm just a
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
little confused on that the so you're
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
saying the utility then should plan
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
going out to say uh if I go out for for
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
default Service rates I better make sure
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
I don't get too much of X gen type of
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
generation because maybe there won't be
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
enough of that around in the future but
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
maybe I should get more of Y I'm a
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
little confused on what that
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
implies well I mean we're talking about
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
10year plans so uh default rate cases
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
usually more shortterm than that but um
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
so yeah they need to look at what are
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
the impacts of their programs and you
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
know how that plays out on a 10-year
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
scale so if they are currently invested
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
heavily in you know transmission and
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
distribution line or distribution lines
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
that are are uh appropriate for a
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
certain technology and not for another
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
technology maybe they uh you know look
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
at what that what the implications of
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
you not really no further questions
 
00:57:02.359 --> 00:57:07.029 align:start position:0%
you not really no further questions
comments

00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
Etc okay seeing
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
none I guess we now have a understanding
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
of Representative kaplan's
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I am now circulating an
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
own which is is
 
00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:27.430 align:start position:0%
own which is is
amendment

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.589 align:start position:0%
amendment
0649

00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
H and this
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is different from
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
amendment in that it amends the original
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
Bill his Amendment
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
0609 amends a previous
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment right representative Kaplan
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
right so this this
 
00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.190 align:start position:0%
right so this this
amendment

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
um just amends the original Bill and it
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
does so by
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
rewriting sections 3 four and five that
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
Bill and
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
then on page two of the original
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
bill it changes on line8 the number six
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
to the number three so that the text
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
would read the utility will have three
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
months to amend and resubmit rather than
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
six months those are the changes that my
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh amendment
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
makes the rewrite of uh lines 23 through
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
30 of the original bill that
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
are lines 3 through eight of the
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh essentially just
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
remove some language about grid modif
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
that what we're looking for here is an
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
assessment of distribution
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure necessary to ensure a
 
00:59:23.549 --> 00:59:23.559 align:start position:0%
reliable and resilient Electric System
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
capable of meeting the forecasted
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
customer customer
 
00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.230 align:start position:0%
customer customer
demand

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
so uh and then of course the rewrite of
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
section five on line 28 in the original
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
Bill Now talks about an assessment of
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
the plan's integration and consistency
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
with the state energy strategy and
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
removes references to
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
environmental and
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
and price
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
um those situations with the utilities
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
and the public commiss uh Utilities
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
Commission told us they don't have the
 
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.549 align:start position:0%
Commission told us they don't have the
wherewithal

01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
wherewithal
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
to assess what long and short-term
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
environmental and economic conditions
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be so we took put uh took
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
those out of the uh
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment so that is the amendment that
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to offer for HB
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
1431 and uh enjo entertain your comments
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
representative Ms so this um so your
 
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment would would um keep the bill
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
as only addressing Electric utilities
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
nothing for Gas Utilities correct okay
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:59.109 align:start position:0%
 
additional

01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh yes I just have tremendous
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about removing um the
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
environment excuse
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
me the environmental impact um I I just
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
think that's that's so dangerous and
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
we've seen instances already in New
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the environment has not
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
been protected from corporations and
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
problems I think the uh concern that was
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
expressed during the public hearing was
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
that if you open this up to
 
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.190 align:start position:0%
that if you open this up to
environmental

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
impacts then these uh the adjudications
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the deliberations on these
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
plans would never end because the number
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
of environmental impacts long and short
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
term is virtually
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
endless and as a result of that these
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
plans would never get approved because
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
the proceedings would drag on for
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
potentially years while all
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
these while every Environmental Group in
 
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
the world brought its
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
concerns uh to the commission about
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
these these plans so it it's it's going
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
to make the bill and the the legislation
 
01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.109 align:start position:0%
to make the bill and the the legislation
unworkable

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
unworkable
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
to leave that in there I understand your
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
concerns and I I share them but I don't
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
think this is the right place to be
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
addressing those
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
concerns representative
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
um I um I agree with I agree with you on
 
01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:45.309 align:start position:0%
um I um I agree with I agree with you on
that

01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
um I think that if we are attempting to
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
reinstate a
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable um
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
process for our state's Electric
 
01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.589 align:start position:0%
process for our state's Electric
utilities

01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
to you know do this kind of
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
planning manage the evolution of the
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
electric grid toward a more
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
um you know disaggregated uh system more
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
decentralized sources of Supply
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I um I think we should keep
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
it we should limit it to that and there
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
are I think that there are lots of there
 
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
are I think that there are lots of there
are

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
other um other venues and other other
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
permitting processes that that would um
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
suffice to protect the
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
environment um you
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
know yeah I just I think um we should
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
keep it tight I like your um Amendment
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
where you're collapsing the timeline and
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
required from you know letting these
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
letting the planning drag on to a year
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
rather um make it um
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
shorter so that
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so that the process be stays
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
meaningful and isn't you know just
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
interminable thank you additional
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative McGee thank you
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um um I think I I I uh could
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
agree with removing maybe the plans long
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
and short term but I I don't see us
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
any uh forward reaching Planning by the
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
utilities should go in front of an
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body one of the only that
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
it goes in front of without any
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
assessment of environmental Public
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
Health economic and energy price in
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
impacts on the state because those are
 
01:04:52.269 --> 01:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
all the things that the people we work
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
for care about right they care care
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
about whether their environment is going
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
to be negatively impacted and their own
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
health and they care about the economics
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing with energy and also
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
the price impacts and so if we remove
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
that language what we're saying is we'll
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
just trust that all that's going to
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
happen without us giving any um any
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
guidance to The Regulators in terms of
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
the expectation that those plans will be
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
looked at in that light and so I think
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
that's really important language I think
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
the thing for consideration is that the
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
additional language that is in the
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Kaplan
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
brought would be lost if we adopt this
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so all of the other um efforts
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
to restate how we would be approaching
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
um electric and utility electric utility
 
01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
and natural gas utility integrated
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
planning would not be covered so we
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
would we would lose um language that I
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
think is also
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
reinstate repres Vice chair Thomas thank
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I um so correct me if I'm
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
wrong but uh wouldn't things such as
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns be the subject of
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
whatever sighting process might be going
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
on at the time should should something
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
new uh come up I mean uh there there
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
must be other avenues we have in the
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
state that handles environmental
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
concerns um besides what was in here so
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
I would think our normal process would
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
anyway representative
 
01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just first I'd like to
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear on what the bill is
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
actually doing so you're going back not
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
to the amendment we received today but
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the original bill as introduced
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
correct say again we we're dealing with
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
changes to the original bill as
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
introduced correct we have two Amendment
 
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.990 align:start position:0%
introduced correct we have two Amendment
proposals

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
so we looking on here then
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
um 378 colon 37 stays the same there's
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
no change to that that stays the same as
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill yes and then in 38
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
we change sections three four and five
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
everything else stays the
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
same it's correct correct okay and then
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
on the the uh last page of the bill as
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
submitted 39 we replace 39 completely
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
with a new
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
correct no the amendment that I've
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
proposed doesn't change anything in 39
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
except the number
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
six in the original Bill my Amendment
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
one other than that language is the same
 
01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
you you say amend
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
37839 one as inserted by section two of
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
the bill by replacing it with the
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
following so you're replacing
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
that whole paragraph correct but the
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
only change is the number to three six
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
is changed to a three for the purposes
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
of drafting the OS attorney thought that
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
replacing the whole paragraph okay was
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
the way go in order to change that and
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
then section two and as well as 37840
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
remain as in the original Bill correct
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay and one last question why was gas
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
taken out since it's a regulated utility
 
01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:42.510 align:start position:0%
taken out since it's a regulated utility
as

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
well I took out gas because
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh well actually I didn't take anything
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
out what I did is I amended the original
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
bill which did not have gas in it so
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
that's the expl for uh explanation for
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
muds um and I apologize if I missed this
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
in your um your introduction of the bill
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
um but in um in the original Bill lines
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
on page one lines 23 through
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
25 which you are
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
amending that the original Bill includes
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
says that such a assessments such
 
01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
assessments shall include consideration
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the benefits and costs of grid
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
modernization you you you are deleting
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
that can you kind of give us some
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
that I think that
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh goes beyond the scope of what a
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
distribution plan is all
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
about that is a subject that I think is
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
beond beyond the scope of of what one of
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
these plans can do and would lead to
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
protracted discussions that would delay
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
the approval of the plan just like
 
01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:05.669 align:start position:0%
the approval of the plan just like
environmental

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
considerations followup but isn't the
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
but isn't the grid the distribution
 
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.149 align:start position:0%
but isn't the grid the distribution
Network

01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
Network
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't the grid is but
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
modernizing the grid is not something
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
that a distribution plan is going to
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
discuss it would Implement
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
modernization requests or or
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
requirements as they uh are
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
imposed representative Ms um but this is
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
you know this is another word for a
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
strategic plan and you know if if the
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
grid is not going to meet the needs
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
of the future shouldn't that be included
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
it could be I suppose but doesn't I
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it needs to be because it
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
just opens a door that might take many
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
close representative McGee thank you um
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think that this
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
distributed integrated distributed
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
Planning by the utilities uh the whole
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
point I think is for them to be doing
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
that planning and looking at that
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
strategy or strategic as as
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative mun said so I'm wondering
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
if we could have Mr Lata come up to
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
speak to whether or not it's potentially
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
burdensome to have grid modernization as
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
something that they should at least be
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
nodding to when they present these plans
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
because I I think it's appropriate I
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
don't know where else we would have it
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the discussions that
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
came up when we decided to eliminate the
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
language was that we needed some
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
language that took the the the larger
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
view rather than just um you know uh
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
what you're putting in today but
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
basically tell us how this is going to
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
play with uh longer term thinking around
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
the stability of the grid itself or the
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
um modernization of the grid so I I
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't see where else those things would
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
be taken into consideration and if
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
there's no dialogue between the
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
regulators and the utilities on that and
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
no statutory requirement for there to be
 
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
Dialogue on that then I think we I think
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
we lose something really essential so
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
could we could we ask um since we have a
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
rep of our largest utility here yes I
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
will ask him in just a moment but first
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'd react to your your comment by saying
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
that it will never be discussed uh in
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
one of these resource plans because it's
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
not defined what is grid modernization
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding of grid modernization
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
is it could be literally hundreds of
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
different things and without a def
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
definition and a and a some specificity
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
in this language about grid
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
modernization you're looking at an
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
approval process for one of these plans
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
it could take years so I I just don't
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
see how you can do this without a
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
definition of what grid modernization is
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it's a broad umbrella term that
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
means hundreds of different
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
things so repres Mr Lata uh to uh allow
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGee to ask you a
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
forward representative Harrington yeah I
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
I think we had a group didn't we
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
establish a group an Advisory Group on
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
grid modernization by Statute last year
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
that I thought yes we did so we do have
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
an active group working on this so it's
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
not like we're we were just ignoring it
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted people to realize that
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you yes so uh to get back to
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
grid modernization I think is fairly
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
well established at least in the
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
utilities Community um and so Mr
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
Lata uh if you could tell us whether
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
having the term grid modernization as it
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
appears in the bill as originally
 
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
written is in any way burdensome in
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
terms of um when you present a
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
plan uh I mean grid modernization could
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
be updating technology different types
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
of meters could be um you know uh
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection points it could be it
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
could be many different things but um
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
does having an overall term that creates
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
a bucket for consideration does that
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
create a burden for the utilities or is
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
it something you already do sure I um I
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
think representative Harrington
 
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
appropriately pointed out that um last
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
year the legislature had passed uh
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh legislation creating a grid
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
modernization advisory committee and
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
that actually is the reference to
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
statute uh that that's in the bill um in
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
terms of so I I agree with um
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's point that
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
there is a venue for conversations
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
around grid
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
modernization uh at the state level and
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the the output of that
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee would be informing um some of
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
the work that the Committees would that
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
the utilities would do as part of this
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
this long-term planning I I don't think
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
that it is um necessary to have grid
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
modernization as it's uh in the bill
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
called out in order for the utilities to
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
capture um you know work that they're
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
doing in this area I do agree with
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative Vose that um you know the
 
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
term grid modernization although it is
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh linked back back statute here can
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of different things to a lot
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
of different people even within the
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
utility space um one might look at that
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
from a metering perspective one might
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
look at it from Smart switches so
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
there's there is a lot there and I am um
 
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the concerns raised by uh
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
some of the committee members and the
 
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
doe of
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
protracted um uh proceedings I I would
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
point out um just maybe to hopefully
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
assuage folks concerns on that uh later
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill it does require the Pu
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
render a decision either to approve or
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
deny a plan within 12 months so we don't
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
want protracted you know lengthy
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings that go on on forever as
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
well as I don't think the doe and
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
commission would either so so there is
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a back stop on the end here to
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
to keep it from becoming a um sort of a
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
fishing Expedition but um I think that
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
you know quite frankly the removal of
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
that language um is is not harmful to
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
the bill it's not harmful to utility
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
planning and if it you know assuages
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
some concerns with the bill about that
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
protracted um uh efforts I think it's
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
removal follow up thank you so was this
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
language part of the original
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
LCP no it was not so grid modernization
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
was not included in the strategic
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
planning basically that we had in place
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
before correct so it's a new thing that
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct okay thank you
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
that helps welcome all right thank you
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Ms you have a question
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
for Mr Lata yes I do okay thank you um
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um are
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
um um interconnects to EV charging
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
stations is that considered
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
distribution yes that's that's done at
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
the distribution level but that's that
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
would be that would be part of the
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
distribution Network and that would be
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
included in a a a um integrated
 
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
distribution planning so so process yeah
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
the short answer is is yes and um as I I
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
previously testified we would be happy I
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
know there was a discussion about
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
presentations in the future um to the
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee and again I'd be happy to have
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
our planning folks come out and talk
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
about the work that they do and how they
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
do it um in terms of a 10-year forecast
 
01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
which is what we're talking about here
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
they look at at sort of industry and
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
population and and economic Trends so
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
there is data that they would access
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
independent um forecasts on say electric
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle growth charging stations
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
required to accommodate that where those
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
charging stations might be located say
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
the 93 Corridor you know if if there's
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
um you know a desire to to support the
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
tourism industry and you know have those
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
folks come up from Massachusetts so
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
that's done at a sort of a high level
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
planning uh perspective but we don't
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
start building until you know we get an
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
actual customer request we do an
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
assessment of that we we do an
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the impact um of that
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
interconnection just like we would with
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
a PV station PV installation and there
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
are costs associated with that
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
installation that are born by the
 
01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
developer seeking um that
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection so I hope that helps
 
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
followup followup no that makes perfect
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
sense to me I guess what I what I was
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get at was you know we we've
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
been talking about you know language and
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
definitions and um you know we can't
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
include the term grid modernization
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
because that has all sorts of different
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
connotations I just wanted to make sure
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
that if we say
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
distribution that you know two years
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
from now or whatever when we see a plan
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't dress interconnect
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
somebody says well no that's not part of
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
the distribution system so that that was
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
my question no no understood and um
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's it's positive
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
growth from increased economic activity
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
um customers choosing different options
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
for either heating or or
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh or on the other end of
 
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
the scale um investments in Energy
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or economic downturns
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be that that depress
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh growth
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
load that would be contained within um
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
the first assessment which is um you
 
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
know a comprehensive forecast of the
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
10-year energy uh demand and that's
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
that's something that you know the
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
commission can we say look under the
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
hood and and question those assumptions
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh and say well hold on a second you
 
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
know why are you assuming this shouldn't
 
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
you be considering that and and just to
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
point out that you know one of the
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
reasons we're supportive of this is um
 
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
you know both from a a utility
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
perspective but I would say also from
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
the customer perspective as well um
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
absent this uh uh regulatory framework
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
that allows the commission and the
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy and consumer
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
Advocate to to see those assumptions the
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
next time that they're going to have an
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to essentially see our
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
growth plans and how we're we're meeting
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
them is during a rate case after we have
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
built that infrastructure and from a
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
customer perspective you know I I can't
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
speak to any Regulators in the room but
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
I know we have a former one sitting up
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
at the table um you know once the
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
utility has built something and and is
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
seeking cost recovery it becomes harder
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
for for a disallowance at that point as
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to if we come in earlier there's
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for the regulator to
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
push back on it because there isn't the
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
financial detriment um to the utility so
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
it allows for that earlier sort of
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
realignment with the commission before
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
money is spent which ultimately is is I
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
think good for the customer as well as
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
as the utility obviously but it it it is
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
a for of I I would say rapair
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
protection okay great thanks we don't
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
need you to repeat your testimony from
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
your from the original Bill uh
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you uh so Mr
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
Lata earlier we were discussing um a an
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
item that would be omitted in
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bose's Amendment and it
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
was the line that says an assessment of
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
the plan's long and short-term
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
Environmental economic and energy price
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
impact on the state that's in in the
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
introduced um I'm wondering uh if you
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
can comment on on those I guess three
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
items here uh whether ever Source has a
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh an opinion on on including
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
environmental economic and energy price
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
impact in the plan sure uh so I think
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
it's very important to remember what
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about with these
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
plans the
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
distribution uh utilities eversource
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
Unitil and um the Electric Co-op
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
although they're not subject to this and
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
and Liberty we're talking about poles
 
01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.350 align:start position:0%
and Liberty we're talking about poles
wires

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
wires
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
Transformers smart switches um so when
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the environmental
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
impacts of this plan we're really
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
talking about that street level
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and so you know this
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
isn't power plants this isn't you know
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
the utility making determinations about
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
shutting down a a gas plant or or um you
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
know really Supply concerns there so we
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
have to comply with all the state uh
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
environmental laws and obviously all the
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
Federal Environmental laws when we are
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
building our infrastructure we have to
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
go get Wetland permits alteration of
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
terrain permits um you know the whole
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
Gambit and so I I do agree with the
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
comment that was previously said that
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
there are many other I think it was
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Rani there are many other
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
venues for environmental considerations
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
of utility infrastructure and if we were
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
to propose a significant pro pro um
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
project um that would be subject to the
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee review process
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
um so so just to you know maybe put that
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
into context in terms of the economic
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
and energy price impact um quite frankly
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
this is what the Public Utilities
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
Commission does that's the the purpose
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
of the commission is to weigh the
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
interest of of customers and the utility
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
through through an economic lens and so
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know removing that I don't think
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
weakens this I don't think it weakens
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
the review the the Pu is going to have
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
cost uh front and center on this and I
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
think I would also point out you know at
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
the end of the day they need to find
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
that that our rates that our decisions
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
are just reasonable and in the public
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
interest so so I am not concerned with
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
the removal of that again if it uh
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
addresses concerns that that folks have
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
um then then I think it's it's worth
 
01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
removal okay thanks a lot Mr Lata I
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we're going to have to
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
move on and talk about 1465 for a few
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
minutes before we uh
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
shut down this full committee work
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
session obviously during the exec
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
session we can have further discussions
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
but representative Ms I'd like you to
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
pass out your amendment to
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
1465 so that we can talk about this for
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
a few minutes before we break for a
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
lunch so please start explaining the
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
amendment while it's uh moving around
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
the table okay um
 
01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
I um I I spoke with um representative o
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington and we
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
also consulted with the um the
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh as well as the
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor on this bill on this
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
amendment and um I think I would
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
characterize this amendment as just
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
trying to to to clean up some things and
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
maybe clarify some things um and
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully not um making too many
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
significant um policy
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
changes um the the one thing that we did
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
is uh clarify that the um uh
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of um of uh the department
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
of energy is um the the senior advisor
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
as it relates to um uh nuclear uh
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
policy um and in probably the most
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
significant step we created a um
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
coordinator of nuclear development and
 
01:27:29.239 --> 01:27:30.950 align:start position:0%
coordinator of nuclear development and
Regulatory

01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
Regulatory
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
activities um to
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
um you know o oversee a lot of the U
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that are now kind of
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
now dispersed among different
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
departments um the responsibility of
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
that Coordinator would be to uh that
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
that Coordinator would be the person
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
that would be responsible for pulling
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
together together the report that's
 
01:27:56.669 --> 01:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
required in statute
 
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
currently um and they would be asking
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
for input from the various departments
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is structured now is
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that each of those departments has to
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
produce a report and it seemed a little
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
bit um
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
redundant um the other thing that the
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment does is put the um
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
coordinator of nuclear development and
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
um regulat activities puts that position
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the office of what is currently
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
called the offshore wind industry devel
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
development um and then what the
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it renames that office
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
the office of in energy in intervention
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
or innovation sorry um and um to address
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that um the department and um
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
and and and others working on this had
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
about the the budget impact of doing all
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this what we have done is set the
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
effective date for the bill or the
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to be June 30th of
 
01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
2025 which gives the um Department time
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get a budget request in if they feel
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
that there is additional
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
costs um there is an opportunity to get
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
money into the next budget which would
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
be proposed next January and would
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
presumably be in effect by July 1 of
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
2025 so they're they they would then
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
have the resources that they need to
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
implement this although it's not
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
included in the in in the amendment um
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we did have were
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
that this office of energy Innovation
 
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.790 align:start position:0%
that this office of energy Innovation
would

01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
become the place where um new and
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
Innovative energy um
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
solutions could be vetted uh
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
analyzed um we talked about in addition
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
to it including offshore wind and
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
nuclear it could potentially be the
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
place where all um studies relating to
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogen battery storage you know other
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
any other Innovative um Technologies
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
would be um reviewed and um
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
analyzed so I think that's it I don't
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
know if representative Harrington or Vos
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
add I do not representative Harrington
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
yeah a couple of things um on the first
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
page line 26 it says the Public
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I don't see that
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
they would have anything to do with the
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear whatsoever and also on line 28
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
talks about his the participation by
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
public utilities subject to the
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction again utilities don't make
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
generation in New Hampshire so they
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be involved in this um the
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
other question I have and I'm not sure
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
the answer on this one uh Department of
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
Transportation talks about the
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
transportation of special nuclear
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
materials on the highways of the state I
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
understand that's regulated by the
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
federal government I don't know if the
 
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
state gets involved we already do have
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
that that this is not a looking to the
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
Future thing we have special nuclear
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
materials being moved because we refuel
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh at least we were refueling at the
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard um so they
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
have to I think the fuel comes in
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire even though it's
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
in Maine and we also uh refuel seab
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
Brook so that would be special nucal
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
material I just don't know if there's
 
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
any involvement there at all at this
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
point I I know the feds regulate that
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
quite extensively but I don't know if
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation has
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
anything to do with it the coordinator
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
can I can I respond to that
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
sure representative months yeah that the
 
01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
the language that you see on page one
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
starting at line 19 all the way through
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
the second page on line 10 I mean that
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
is language that already exists in
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
statute I just carried it forward so I
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
mean you may you I'm not going to
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
question you know whether I mean there
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
may be some issues there um you know
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation I'm
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that that gets at exactly what
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
you talked about I mean the
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
transportation of nule material to the
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
kidy shipyard KY uh the na the
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Naval Yard and and seab Brook
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
um but that language that that's
 
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
existing language there was no changes
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
there y just copied it
 
01:32:36.239 --> 01:32:38.310 align:start position:0%
there y just copied it
over

01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
exactly so representative Ms could you
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment replaces uh section two of the
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
original bill that appears on page two
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
starting at line
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
five yeah it it replaces section two uh
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
as you said starting on page two line
 
01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:06.790 align:start position:0%
as you said starting on page two line
five

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
um it also replaces section
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
four which starts on page two at line
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
22 and then it
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.990 align:start position:0%
22 and then it
um

01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.030 align:start position:0%
um
it

01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
changes section
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
five with the language that's included
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
in the amendment on page three starting
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
at line 19 that talks about you know the
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
the office of windshore energy
 
01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.470 align:start position:0%
the office of windshore energy
development

01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:45.310 align:start position:0%
development
um

01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I know that
 
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor was very concerned
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
about um Advanced nuclear reactors so it
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
it it does not change paragraph
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
three in the original bill that def that
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
talks about that that's still in the
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
bill but what I'm concerned about now
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate the new the definition of n
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear that's on in the
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
original bill on page
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
three I don't think so it uh adds
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
sections after section five of the bill
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't replace section five okay
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
yep thank you thank thank you thank you
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
there so it changes section two it
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
changes section four and then it adds
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
these these additional sections at the
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
end that just do the housekeeping of
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
changing the name of the office of
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
energy of of offshore wind to energy
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation and that's all it does it
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
just changes the name that's that
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing no increase in the scope
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
or anything okay great representative
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
Kaplan has a question or a comment thank
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
you chairman yeah I I need some
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
clarification on uh page four of the
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is this new uh starting on
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
line three the the establishment of a
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund that's not in the
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
original bill is it that's not in the
 
01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
original Bill and that is that's not new
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's existing language the only thing
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's being done in that whole sect
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one there is changing the
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
name um on line
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
14 okay thank you representative Thomas
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
has a comment or question yes I do thank
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I have uh two questions
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
clarification questions first of all um
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
we heard uh some comment earlier that
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the nrc's purview covers nuclear
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
facilities so would this commission link
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
arms with the NRC is there any mechanism
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
and my second question is the fiscal
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
note does this um Amendment at all alter
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note thank
 
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
you uh again I mean I I I I don't think
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
it changes anything in terms of the
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
state's relationship with the nuclear
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission um really all
 
01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing is establishing a a a
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
position in the state to kind of
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
coordinate all of that so if anything it
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it it makes it more efficient in
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
terms of how the state interacts with
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
the nuclear Regulatory Commission and
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
then um in terms of the um fiscal note
 
01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.590 align:start position:0%
then um in terms of the um fiscal note
um

01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I I I I I don't have the answer to
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
that other than I'm assuming that since
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
we're um delaying the financial impact
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
until you know a future budget year that
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
there really is no fiscal impact this
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.390 align:start position:0%
there really is no fiscal impact this
year

01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay additional comments representative
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I I realize uh what the
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
um uh sponsor of this bill was trying to
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
do but I just think there's so much
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
stuff baggage hanging on this that it
 
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
really needs to be cleaned up
 
01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:09.159 align:start position:0%
substantially I mean if you look on
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the paragraph that was just mentioned
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
there the department of energy cells
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
studies state and federal policies
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
technology Supply chains and potential
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
sighting locations related to Advanced
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors well that could take
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
four people four years or maybe longer
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
it is wide open it there's no I mean I
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
don't what would they be studying it's
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a department of energy
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's staffed up to look into uh all of
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff and to to come up with
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
sighting locations I meaning all that's
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
going to be done by a private company if
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
and when they ever decide they want to
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire so that's uh
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's one thing and then part of the
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
other stuff if you look at uh going back
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
to the original bill which I think this
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
is still in the original bill on page
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
two as well line starting on line seven
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
says conduct studies concerning changes
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
in laws and rules and it goes on to talk
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
about that would arise from the presence
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
within the state of special nuclear
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
materials and product materials and from
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
the operation herein on production of
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
utilization of facilities and blah blah
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
blah this I assume was put in way back
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
before we had any nuclear facilities in
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
the state and if and when this law was
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
complied to it's already been done
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
whatever administrative rules we decided
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
we needed are put in place and we've
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
like I said we've always been dealing
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
with special nuclear material in the
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
state for a number of years and uh I'm
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
not sure why we're going back and
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
redoing apparently is what they want
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
this to be redone uh we don't even know
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
if it's been done in the first place so
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
I just think this bill needs a lot of
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
work before we do this and like I say
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
assigning that study state and federal
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
policies blah blah blah blah blah that
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
could be that could be a whole
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
department just to do that I mean it
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
just it's we need to really trim the
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
stuff down find out what has been done
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been done what doesn't need
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
to be done so I just mentioned it does
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
talk about the Public Utilities
 
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
Commission in there uh which has no
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over any nuclear
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
transactions whatsoever it talks about
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
the public utilities which again in our
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
state where we have no have vertically
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
integrated utilities no Public Utilities
 
01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
going to be making and going to be
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
building a nuclear plant these are
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
things that are in the bill that are
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
dated from whenever this was originally
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
written 30 or 40 years ago and I just
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
think before we put out a bill that
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
appears to bring things up to speed when
 
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
only we're doing is changing a few names
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
we this this needs a lot more
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
work representative
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
parall thank you chair and um I agree
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
totally with the remarks of our uh of
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
the person to my left here um one other
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
question I would like to ask of him if I
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
may though is uh the cost of this
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
program when we' just received um some
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
dire warnings about uh Revenue coming
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
into the state and the expenses we're
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
already putting on the book does this
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
add additional expense to uh program
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we're looking that doesn't really
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
have a good definition to begin
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
with I may Mr chairman I think that
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
question was answered earlier when it
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
was pointed out that this bill wouldn't
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
take effect until after 2025 June 1st or
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
June 30th or something to know it would
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
have no immediate financial impact but
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
eventually if it's as written if it
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
stays on the books it would require an
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
awful lot of studies and Analysis and
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
stuff to do that and that is potentially
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
true that is potentially true so this is
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
an early Bill we have to make a decision
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
about it today today is our last
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make a decision on this
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
bill so I just alert you to that fact as
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
we uh prepare for our executive session
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
at 1:00 and with that I think we're
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to uh suspend our full committee
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
work session activity for the time
 
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
being and I'm going to call a republican
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
caucus in this room immediately so I
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
would appreciate everyone exiting the
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
room as quickly as
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
possible after the uh caucus is over
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
then we're on lunch break until 1:00 and
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
we will see you all at 1:00 thank you
 
01:41:25.159 --> 01:41:49.830 align:start position:0%
we will see you all at 1:00 thank you
very

01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.840 --> 02:57:42.990 align:start position:0%
 
much

02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:43.000 --> 03:04:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:42.359 --> 03:04:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.150 --> 03:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay everyone time to get back to work
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
here science technology and energy for
 
03:04:59.950 --> 03:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
February 13 2024 we have an executive
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
session coming up on three
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
bills and those three bills will be
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
taken in this order the first bill we
 
03:05:10.030 --> 03:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
will exact is HB
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
1465 FN relative to studies of nuclear
 
03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:15.269 align:start position:0%
1465 FN relative to studies of nuclear
Energy

03:05:15.269 --> 03:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
Energy
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
Technologies then we will move on to hb1
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
1644 which will have a new title and
 
03:05:28.030 --> 03:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
1431 are there any uh announcements that
 
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
need to be made before we start our exec
 
03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
sessions representative
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair uh we had
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
the discussion about our field trip to
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
ISO New England which was tentatively
 
03:05:48.750 --> 03:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the 12th of March and as
 
03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
we discussed this morning that happens
 
03:05:52.990 --> 03:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
to be town meeting day for many many
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
folks so the alternative date now is 15

rather has been vetted by the department

of energy and they found it to be
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:45.269 align:start position:0%

I need to type it so can I can I go home
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
and type it and send it to you we would
 
03:11:59.950 --> 03:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
prefer not this is an early bill and we
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%

it okay so we're all set with that then
 
03:12:14.910 --> 03:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
all right so let's close the exact
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:23.950 --> 03:12:23.960 align:start position:0%

03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
1644 I'll open that exec session and I
 
03:12:36.590 --> 03:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:39.389 --> 03:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
0610 and I recognize representative
 
03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
licki I second that motion moved in
 
03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:45.880 align:start position:0%

03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:47.750 align:start position:0%

03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
2024
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
610h to House Bill
 
03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
1644 I will start the discussion by
 
03:12:57.790 --> 03:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.990 --> 03:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment which adds nuclear
 
03:13:04.469 --> 03:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
powered generating facilities to the
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
RPS is not technically a renewable form
 
03:13:09.279 --> 03:13:10.389 align:start position:0%
RPS is not technically a renewable form
of

03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
energy there is so much renewable energy
 
03:13:18.070 --> 03:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
I mean U nuclear energy fuel out there
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
that it will be almost virtually
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
renewable I'll also point out that the
 
03:13:27.429 --> 03:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
evolution of the renewable portfolio
 
03:13:29.590 --> 03:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
standard will likely mean that it
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
becomes a zero emissions portfolio
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
standard at some point in the not too
 
03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:35.110 align:start position:0%
standard at some point in the not too
distant

03:13:35.110 --> 03:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
distant
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
future what I think this this amendment
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
will do is send a loud and clear message
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire that this
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
legislature is open to considering
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
nuclear power as a future generation
 
03:13:53.590 --> 03:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
Source now we all know that nuclear
 
03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
power is not perfect it has its it has
 
03:13:59.830 --> 03:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
its issues and problems but they're not
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
insoluble un insolvable I should say and
 
03:14:06.229 --> 03:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
there are many many companies working on
 
03:14:09.309 --> 03:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
new nuclear technologies that will be
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
far superior to what exists here today
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important for New
 
03:14:17.790 --> 03:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be on record as saying that
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
we are open to nuclear generated
 
03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
electricity going
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
forward not only are we open to it but
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
we recognize the imperative that nuclear
 
03:14:33.389 --> 03:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
energy is very likely to become a
 
03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
significant part of our
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.479 --> 03:14:44.469 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%

03:14:47.710 --> 03:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
um during the discussion of the bill I
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
raised um concern about um putting out a
 
03:14:55.630 --> 03:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
sign that says New Hampshire is open for
 
03:14:59.910 --> 03:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
business for uh nuclear energy admitted
 
03:15:01.710 --> 03:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
that that there's nothing in the
 
03:15:05.710 --> 03:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
immediate future however um I believe
 
03:15:07.750 --> 03:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's the cart before the horse I mean
 
03:15:10.469 --> 03:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
unless we put significant guard rails in
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and I realize the nuclear regulation
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee is in in charge of that or
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
oversees that I just I'm I'm telling you
 
03:15:22.510 --> 03:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
I've got PTSD from St gobain and I just
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
do not see putting in other corporations
 
03:15:28.429 --> 03:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
that could potentially affect the
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
community without significant
 
03:15:34.189 --> 03:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
oversight further discussion
 
03:15:34.199 --> 03:15:35.469 align:start position:0%

representative

03:15:35.469 --> 03:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:15:37.790 --> 03:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
Kennedy yeah I just wanted to point out
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
which I think already has been that the
 
03:15:43.710 --> 03:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
NRC regulates nuclear power power and
 
03:15:46.590 --> 03:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
they are the most stringent agency you
 
03:15:48.910 --> 03:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
could imagine I mean they virtually
 
03:15:51.150 --> 03:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
halted all nuclear development for like
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
30 years so I think it will be looked at
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know very thoroughly before anything
 
03:15:56.760 --> 03:15:58.790 align:start position:0%
you know very thoroughly before anything
is

03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%

FN now before we open an exec session on
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:19:43.229 --> 03:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
1431 we need to have a brief
 
03:19:46.269 --> 03:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about where the amendment
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to adopt might be do
 
03:19:51.189 --> 03:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know representative
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
Kaplan okay so we're going to take a
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
break while we wait for the office of
 
03:19:59.110 --> 03:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
legislation legislative services to
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
produce a new
 
03:20:04.269 --> 03:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
version of an amendment that we think we
 
03:20:07.150 --> 03:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
will all like for House Bill
 
03:20:09.309 --> 03:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
1431 this new
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment takes the amendment that I
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
propose during our work session and adds
 
03:20:16.830 --> 03:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
natural gas to
 
03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:19.950 align:start position:0%
natural gas to
it

03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
and retains the original Amendment the
 
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the original amendment I think
 
03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to all parties so as
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
soon as we get that new Amendment we
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
will look at it we'll discuss it and
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
then we'll decide how to deal with it so
 
03:20:40.030 --> 03:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
until that time can we take a
 
03:20:41.710 --> 03:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah when you
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
say say add natural gas is it going to
 
03:20:45.389 --> 03:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
add natural gas as it was in the the
 
03:20:46.990 --> 03:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
last there was one amendment that had
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas in it already is that the
 
03:20:52.950 --> 03:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
one that section of that Amendment okay
 
03:20:54.389 --> 03:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
right yes I assume that's how what it
 
03:20:55.469 --> 03:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
will look like I haven't seen the
 
03:20:58.830 --> 03:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
amendment but um representative Kaplan
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.150 --> 03:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
OSS okay let's take a five minute break

at restart at 1:30 unfortunately we're
 
03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to restart restart
 
03:33:19.189 --> 03:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
at 1:30 but I want to tell you
 
03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
why so representative Kaplan asked OS to
 
03:33:26.790 --> 03:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
draft a new Amendment and they did and
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
he got it just before we recessed a few
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
minutes ago or broke uh took a break a
 
03:33:34.510 --> 03:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago and he was looking at it
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
and he discovered in the gas section
 
03:33:38.910 --> 03:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
they forgot to remove the line about
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
environmental stuff so he went back and
 
03:33:45.710 --> 03:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
asked for yet another new
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
version and so that version is in the
 
03:33:51.790 --> 03:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
works and so we will have to wait until
 
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
that one comes through before we can um
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
before we can vote on this bill so
 
03:34:00.750 --> 03:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's where we are so I'd ask you all
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
to stay close to your seats and
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan will let us know
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
the minute this new Amendment arrives
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
and uh we will go from there yeah Chris
 
03:34:12.670 --> 03:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
bringing it down as soon as it's ready
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
so Christy will bring it down as soon as
 
03:34:18.990 --> 03:34:19.000 align:start position:0%

fast so representative Kaplan has uh the
 
03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
text of the amendment it's working its
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
way around why don't you describe what
 
03:50:50.159 --> 03:50:50.870 align:start position:0%
way around why don't you describe what
it

03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
does okay thank you Mr chair this
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
amendment basically amends the original
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
bill by getting us back to the original
 
03:51:06.550 --> 03:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
language of an assessment of it keeps
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
378 37 the the definition of energy
 
03:51:11.630 --> 03:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
policy and the sort of the principle the
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
first principle of what uh integrated
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
planning should be all
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
about takes us back to the original
 
03:51:20.990 --> 03:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
language on assessment of distribution
 
03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:22.269 align:start position:0%
language on assessment of distribution
infrastructure

03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:51:25.149 --> 03:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
only and uh states that the the
 
03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
assessments of any assessment of a
 
03:51:29.349 --> 03:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
plan's integration cons has to be
 
03:51:31.149 --> 03:51:31.159 align:start position:0%
consistent with the state energy
 
03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
strategy uh and then it goes on to add
 
03:51:35.830 --> 03:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
some language around Gas Distribution
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
Gas Utilities as well so that the Gas
 
03:51:40.189 --> 03:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
Utilities are also included in the need
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
plans so I think this
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment gets the Public Utilities
 
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
Commission back to its it gives it a
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
tool to get back to its oversight Duty
 
03:51:57.149 --> 03:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
over our state's
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
utilities and it also has the uh the the
 
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
virtue of Simplicity and
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and uh you know efficiency so that we
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
you don't get bogged down in these
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
proceedings so I think it meets uh I
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
think it meets our
 
03:52:18.149 --> 03:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
needs thank you representative Kaplan as
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
I read the amendment it does exactly
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
what representative
 
03:52:26.070 --> 03:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
Kaplan uh suggested that it would do it
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
takes an earlier
 
03:52:31.870 --> 03:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and adds gas to it and that's
 
03:52:36.149 --> 03:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
it and so um I think this amendment
 
03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
passes muster and I think we uh should
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
seriously consider passing it were there
 
03:52:46.110 --> 03:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.429 --> 03:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
copies could Mr Lata oh he has one okay
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure he had one
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
there are some extra copies here if
 
03:52:53.399 --> 03:52:54.510 align:start position:0%
there are some extra copies here if
anybody

03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
needs couple of extra copies here if
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
anybody would
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
like to uh to peruse this amendment okay
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
03:53:14.429 --> 03:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I still have one
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
reservation here there was something in
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment one that we were looking at
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
before 0609 H
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
about that uh no distribution rate
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
change would be approved or ordered
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
until a plan had been approved and
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's no longer here and I'm just
 
03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's really no teeth
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
in this that the timing repeats until a
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
plan is approved but there's there's
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
nothing about all right well until you
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
approve a plan you you don't get to
 
03:53:48.910 --> 03:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
change your distribution rates so I'm
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
just a little concerned about
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
that so during the public hearing it was
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
that issue was addressed by I think it
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
was Mr France of the Department of
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
energy and he stated
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
that you could run seriously into a
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue there of depriving
 
03:54:12.189 --> 03:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
the ability the utility of the ability
 
03:54:15.790 --> 03:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
to recover its costs prudently and so he
 
03:54:18.269 --> 03:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
suggested that no enforcement me
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism was really necessary for this
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
bill and so that's why my original
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment took it out and why
 
03:54:28.269 --> 03:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan agreed that that
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
that was a suitable change if I could
 
03:54:33.389 --> 03:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
just add a comment on that I I think the
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
fact that the utilities are on board
 
03:54:39.070 --> 03:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
with this process says a lot uh and if
 
03:54:41.510 --> 03:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the case and they're carrying
 
03:54:43.870 --> 03:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
out these plans in in a you know sort of
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
good faith effort that that is good
 
03:54:50.110 --> 03:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
enough for
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none looks like we can
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%

03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
February
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
20th at 10:00 a.m. for a full committee
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
work session on the last three bills
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we have before us for this session
 
03:58:54.149 --> 03:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
and then at 1:00 that afternoon we'll
 
03:58:56.429 --> 03:58:56.439 align:start position:0%
have an exec session on those same three
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
bills and I will attempt to send out
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendments for those bills if needed by
 
03:59:08.110 --> 03:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
this Friday if possible representative n
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
um just clarification did you they you
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
said 10:00 a.m. but did you mean 9:00
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
a.m. no I meant 10:00 a.m.
 
03:59:18.510 --> 03:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay unless there's an objection does
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to start at
 
03:59:24.990 --> 03:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
nine I thought 10 would be a better
 
03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
start time especially since every other
 
03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday this room is used from 9: to 10
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
by another group y so I thought it'd be
 
03:59:36.990 --> 03:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
safe to start at
 
03:59:40.429 --> 03:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
10: anything else El see you all next
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday have a wonderful rest of the
 
03:59:44.429 --> 03:59:44.439 align:start position:0%
week and a nice weekend and Happy
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.920 --> 04:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
