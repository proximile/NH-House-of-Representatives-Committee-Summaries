extended producer responsibility
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open that hearing and have
 
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative dutse introduce this bill
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
to us thank you good morning good
 
00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 align:start position:0%
morning thank you madam chair and
 
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
committee members I am going to be
 
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
reading a testimony by the prime sponsor
 
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative parshall and can take
 
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions after that
 
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.310 align:start position:0%
questions after that
uh

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
as stated in previous testimony the full
 
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
cost of product packaging does not show
 
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
up at the time of purchase
 
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 align:start position:0%
rather it appears on my Municipal tax
 
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.890 align:start position:0%
rather it appears on my Municipal tax
bill

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
this cost of disposal is shifted
 
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
entirely from the producer to the
 
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
consumer and has real costs in terms of
 
00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
both economics and the environment this
 
00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
is why an examination of extended
 
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility will be of
 
00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
benefit to our state a common model that
 
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
is in use elsewhere would be to contract
 
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
with an established packaging material
 
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
stewardship organization
 
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
the stewardship program will collect
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
certain waste stream costs from
 
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 align:start position:0%
participating municipalities in
 
00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 align:start position:0%
connection with packaging producers
 
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
questions for a study committee may
 
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
include whether payments from producers
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
of packaging material will be based on
 
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 align:start position:0%
the amount of weight of packaging
 
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
material or some other metric other
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
questions could be in how to
 
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
differentiate various materials whether
 
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 align:start position:0%
they be electronic paper plastic or
 
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
other categories within our waste stream
 
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
would producer payments received by the
 
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
stewardship organization be used solely
 
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 align:start position:0%
to reimburse participating
 
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities or could the stewardship
 
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
organization use a reasonable portion of
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
producer payments to cover operational
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
expenses and to provide for education
 
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure aimed at reducing
 
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
packaging waste a study committee could
 
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
also ask if producers May offset some
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
portion of this payment obligation by
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
meeting other program incentives
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
obviously there are many issues to work
 
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
through before a comprehensive and
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
workable piece of legislation can be
 
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
drafted this makes the work of a study
 
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
committee imperative along with calling
 
00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and receiving testimony the
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
committee would focus all of his efforts
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
into drafting legislation within good
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
input from numerous stakeholders
 
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
as consumers of these products we have
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
little to say on how they are delivered
 
00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
to us there are hidden costs that we
 
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
absorb both in our Municipal budgets and
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
our environment this is our opportunity
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
to place the burden of packaging
 
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.449 align:start position:0%
to place the burden of packaging
decisions

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 align:start position:0%
squarely where it belongs thank you
 
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative dutsy so I have
 
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
a question with and I know that you're
 
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
just introducing this for representative
 
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
just introducing this for representative
partial

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
partial
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
but the bill itself doesn't is not
 
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
um explicitly
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
make the questions that you posed in his
 
00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.490 align:start position:0%
make the questions that you posed in his
introduction

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.210 align:start position:0%
in this bill
it's

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
it just says that the committee shall
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
study shall examine waste reduction
 
00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.550 align:start position:0%
study shall examine waste reduction
goals

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 align:start position:0%
through extended you know in their
 
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
examining the waste reduction goals
 
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 149
 
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
M with emphasis on the Improvement of
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal recycling reducing solid waste
 
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
flow and reducing taxpayer costs in
 
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
support of Municipal transfer stations
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
through extended producer responsibility
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't actually direct the
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the particular
 
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
questions that you posed in the
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
introduction do you think the bill
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think so because if you look at
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
the the very first line there is
 
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
established a committee to study
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility in
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
order to provide relief to the cost of
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities and solid waste disposal
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
and I believe what representative
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
Parcell is trying to bring up in his
 
00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 align:start position:0%
testimony is that there are
 
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
extender producer responsibility is a
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
broad topic there's a lot of different
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
things in play and I think in his
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
testimony he's suggesting that these are
 
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
some of the things that the committee
 
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
could look at and that's the reason why
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
we need a committee I will give you an
 
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.689 align:start position:0%
we need a committee I will give you an
example

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
I'm working with a group of people now
 
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 align:start position:0%
uh trying to craft a container deposit
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
system known as a bottle bill
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
and in a number of in a number of states
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
and a number of organizations considers
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
a bottle Bill to be a foundational
 
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
legislation for extended producer
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility so that's usually the
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
start of
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward in this area and I can
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
tell you it has I call it an octopus
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
with a thousand arms because there are
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
so many things to consider
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
in this kind of legislation you know
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
that that you need
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of research and a lot of time to
 
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
look at it and I think what this bill
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
does in this whole area is begin the
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
process to bring the stakeholders
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
involved so that we can at least
 
00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.189 align:start position:0%
involved so that we can at least
understand

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
how we might
 
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
craft legislation for epr that works for
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because what I have seen
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
in working on the bottle bill is that
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
you just can't take a piece of
 
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislation from another state and think
 
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 align:start position:0%
it's going to work here
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
were unique and I think and I think that
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
opening statement is Broad enough to
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
bring in all of these ideas I think the
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee would have to then sit through
 
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.350 align:start position:0%
committee would have to then sit through
them

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
because my concern is that if we make
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
this study committee
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
too broad they really you know that we
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
have time constraints and so forth but
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
if it's made too broad you know just
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
study extended producer responsibility
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's such a huge topic I don't know
 
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:03.380 align:start position:0%
how they could distill anything down
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
to be of meaning there's just so much
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
that they could be looking at and I
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
think it from from my perspective I
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
think it just makes more sense to kind
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
of maybe restrict to to look at specific
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
parts of epr
 
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379 align:start position:0%
well I I think if correct me if I'm
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
wrong but I think we have two states
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
right now that have epr legislation in
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
place I think one is Oregon one is Maine
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that that's where
 
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
they would probably
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
want to start looking at those existing
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
laws how they were implemented where
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're going and then go from there but
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's just a guess okay a question from
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.829 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
chair

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:52.490 align:start position:0%
chair
um

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
are you aware that a similar version of
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
this came before that we were able to
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
kind of have a subcommittee work group
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
on and uh looked at this concept of epr
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
that was the bill for electronics epr
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
Electronics or was there a committee
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
um there was it was referred to in a
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
room study if I remember correctly in
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
nope okay I'd have to say I'm not I
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't remember that one no that's okay
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
in which case I was going to ask um if
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
you were aware of several of the
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
findings that came out of that of which
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
I had chaired that subcommittee work
 
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.070 align:start position:0%
I had chaired that subcommittee work
session

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative Murray so you're saying
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
that you chaired the EP I thought it was
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
the epr for electronics was that it and
 
00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:52.339 align:start position:0%
and okay
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
so there's a so there's a preview
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
there's a previous epr committee there
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
last year we had a bill
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
requested the study committee on elect
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
on epr we
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
um we voted it was in the second year we
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
voted it uh interim study and we were
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
expecting to uh and we also put it into
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
a sort of an Omnibus study bill uh 1049
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
that was going to study a whole lot of
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
stuff but the Senate killed that
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that study is available and then
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
there was we did the interim study and
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
Megan chaired that interim study session
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry say that again thank you that
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
for that representative Bixby
 
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
for that representative Bixby
[Laughter]

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up yeah thank you
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
um thank you so
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
to your point uh Madam chair about
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not epr should
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
um be the focus I think we had had
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the fact that there were if
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
memory serves correctly 13 states at
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
that point mulling over various aspects
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the legislation for extended producer
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility Maine is leading in that
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
area and they have established a program
 
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
already and part of the I think the
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
findings and the discussion were that
 
00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:21.470 align:start position:0%
findings and the discussion were that
um

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-size-fits-all model
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
depending on how things are proceeding
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
through States and that's why we said
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
that yes this was worthy of we felt as a
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session that it was
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
worthy of future legislation and I think
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
that that is representative partials
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
attempt to do to do that to bring a
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
study committee that looks at what the
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
right fit would be for New Hampshire is
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not privy to representative
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
powershell's thinking you know on the
 
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.630 align:start position:0%
powershell's thinking you know on the
bill

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm a co-sponsor on it because I
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
support it and I I agree with you
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
completely it's not
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
um a couple of years ago I looked into a
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
possible epr regarding tires okay
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
because there was there was an issue
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
there is an issue in the Connecticut
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
River of tires being thrown in and and
 
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
so thinking about how we could go ahead
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
and look um track you know
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
um the the various ways that that tires
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
can go through a system and we could
 
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:30.500 align:start position:0%
um recycle them or
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
dispose of them correctly and again it's
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
a it's a very complicated issue and I
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
think I I agree with you we need a study
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
to at least start it and look at what
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
works for New Hampshire
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's you know
 
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.210 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's you know
um

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
we might not get anything definitive out
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
of this committee like we would want but
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's a start and I think from there we
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
can figure out
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
um where we might want to go and
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative Dusty now I just became I
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
was just appointed to be the house
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
member on the solid waste working group
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
is that something that they are not
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
already studying are they are they
 
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
looking at epr
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
not I don't know not that I'm aware of I
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
mean I've attended some of their
 
00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:26.210 align:start position:0%
mean I've attended some of their
sessions

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
um via zoom and you know I think
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know they're looking at the whole
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
uh landfill issue obviously this is a
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
um measuring you know uh measuring our
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
waste being able to track whether or not
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're meeting some of our goals
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure maybe other people on
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
the committee know but I don't think
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
that they've drilled down that far
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
because they've had other issues that
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
they've had to deal with uh rep Madam
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
chairman one of the things that I get
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
from what you know being involved in
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
this for the last couple of years is
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire is so
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
far behind in this area we haven't met
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
our goals and correct me if I'm wrong I
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
believe from the early 90s it may even
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
go back to the 80s
 
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
other states are moving ahead of us
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of issues going on where
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts for example
 
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
and other states are Banning the
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
disposal of materials which means that
 
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
those materials are more likely to end
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
up in New Hampshire and at even if this
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill may not be perfect I think having a
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
committee look at it and working with
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
the Solid Waste Management Group I don't
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
think we can put too many hands on deck
 
00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:51.139 align:start position:0%
right now for the whole issue of
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
waste and waste reduction
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative Howard
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I I agree with you that um the the
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
seems like the outcomes or the the
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
report from the this because the the
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
topic is so broad it seems like the
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
report could be could come back yes
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
they're they're just finding that there
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
is an an extended responsibility
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
and I I would um
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that we make it more that we
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
report more specific about not just
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
about the extended responsibility but
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
also the pro the materials and products
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
for which that we for which they are
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
responsible and that we could use to
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.069 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
chair

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
um to that I would happily um if if it
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
is the will of the body to narrow the
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
focus down I'm happy to contribute my
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
notes from the last
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
um sort of iteration of things that
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
discuss the varying types of epr
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
programs that are out there and what
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
that looks like so if that's something
 
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to contribute that
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
sure I'm I can I think we can also have
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
our committee researcher do some
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
checking around on some things having to
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
do with epr and who is what states have
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
instituted epr and and what means and
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
fashion they've done that representative
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
Bixby you have a question yes so um
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh I have a very short question which
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
you probably will say that will depend
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
on the committee but uh it's currently
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
written uh to uh have
 
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.509 align:start position:0%
written uh to uh have
um

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
two members of the Senate uh as three
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
house members my experience in study
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
committees has been it's hard enough to
 
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.100 align:start position:0%
get one member of the Senate to show up
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh so would uh do you believe that this
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor would be amenable to
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
amending it to have one member
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
of the Senate
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for representative partial
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
but I I would assume that he would be
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that uh if it you know if
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
it allows us to get this bill uh passed
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up go ahead so um
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
there seems to be some concern that uh
 
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.490 align:start position:0%
there seems to be some concern that uh
the

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
um as as written is not sufficiently
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
directive in terms of what to be studied
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
what should be studied uh but would you
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh think that it would make sense to uh
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
use this study committee in order to
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
identify those aspects of epr that are
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
most amenable to uh being worked on in
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sooner rather than later
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
and uh and perhaps
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
um amending it to uh to indicate that
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at looking to find
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
the best Avenues
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely representative Bixby I
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean I think one of the benefits that we
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
have right now is that I believe you
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
have 10 states that have bottle bills in
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
place I know Michigan goes back to 1978
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
so we can look at the success rate there
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
you've indicated that there's 13 other
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
states you know that are looking at epr
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
um you know this gives us an opportunity
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
to see what what they have focused on
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
um as maybe the the best place to start
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
it's such a huge area that I think you
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
know we we just need to to look at what
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
would be the most appropriate for New
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we need to start and
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
then go from there but I I totally agree
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh Madam chair I I
 
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
also just wanted to make sure that we
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
noted that um also
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
um representative Ebel is a co-sponsor
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
on this piece of legislation yes and so
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I know that she does a lot of work
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
with solid waste working group as well
 
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
with solid waste working group as well
so

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
um she's the chair correct so
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
um to that end I I
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
think that this should be something that
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
we move to take a look at in a way that
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
um maybe gives the most flexibility as
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
possible to get as many of the ideas
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
compiled okay
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions for uh
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
and I believe the sponsor would be very
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
agreeable to you know any additions or
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the bill to make it the best
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill that we possibly can okay thank you
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other pink cards for
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
this uh for this bill is there anybody
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
make comments or or testify in favor or
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
against representative Bixby uh one yes
 
00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
against representative Bixby uh one yes
ma'am

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
just fill out a pink card and then have
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
a seat you can testify first and hand
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
we might also be able to get information
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
from Mr North about the status of epr
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
and it's always working group from whom
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
your microphone please and and welcome
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
to environment there's a button on the
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
bottom yeah there you go I'm in a red
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
now and state your name state your name
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
where you're from thank you my name is
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
Cynthia Walter I'm from Dover and um
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
just driving a lot driving here took me
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
longer than I expected so I'm late I'm
 
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
longer than I expected so I'm late I'm
sorry

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
um I saw trash all along the highway
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
um I had to stop and get just just the
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
other day we Dover has run out of bags
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
for its Municipal recycling uh uh ZIP
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
program because we have so much waste
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's using up the bags
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
um these bags are very expensive so
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
people with low income have a serious
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
problem with uh affording those bags
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know and I also am a scientist who
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
studies pollution
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
and people's exposures to toxics and
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
packaging is of course a major source of
 
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:28.940 align:start position:0%
all of that so we have problems from
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
from the traffic in every direction from
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
packaging and the extended producer
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility bills that we've seen in
 
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
all those states that you've just
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned are different ways of
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
approaching this massive complicated
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
problem and I think this study committee
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
is the way to engage the stakeholders
 
00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539 align:start position:0%
it's also a way to help many of us small
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
many of the small business people that
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
are just the Hallmark and the ground
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
ground strength of New Hampshire
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
they need ways to safely package their
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
products to their customers and those
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
packaging materials we've been a few of
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
us in a group have been meeting with
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
some of the packaging suppliers
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
and there's just not the options that
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
those small business people need in this
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
region so the extended producer
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
responsibility in plan can involve then
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
ways to enhance our small businesses and
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
help them get the packaging that's safe
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
and and responsible and so forth so I
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
think there's just many many
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that could benefit from
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
this work and I please hope that you
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
pass it and move it as fast as we can
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your comments
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
anyone you have questions representative
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair for taking
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
my question um to your point
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of organizations that
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
are all that are working towards this
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
very goal such as the Ellen MacArthur
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
Foundation who has an international
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
effort of signatories of
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
of uh various stakeholders including
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are signing on who are
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
small medium and large corporations
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
um who are in agreement that
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some effort to make
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a closed cycle and
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
the ability to have
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
um items recovered
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
well that particular one I'm sorry I'm
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
poor hearing but maybe you can spell it
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
out for me at some point after the
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
meeting sure is to I don't want to delay
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
you though but I'd be happy to hear
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
about that group but I'll need it on
 
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.289 align:start position:0%
about that group but I'll need it on
writing

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
anybody else with questions
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking the time
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
to come up here and testify
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to Now call
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
Michael Nork from nhdes to come and
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
committee

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
um my name is Michael Nork I'm with the
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Solid Waste
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau I wasn't actually
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
intending to speak but I'm happy to
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
answer any questions for the committee I
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
just I also want to mention that the
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
department does support this we have no
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
reason to not want to investigate this
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
issue it's something we're aware of
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
other states are obviously looking
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
into and developing their own policies
 
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
into and developing their own policies
so

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
um you know it's something that has been
 
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
in place for a number of years in Canada
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
and a number of states in the Northeast
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
and on the west coast as well so
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
um you know it is something that comes
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
up a lot and um
 
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
I am aware that the solid waste working
 
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.690 align:start position:0%
I am aware that the solid waste working
group

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
could be generally interpret the charge
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
of that group could be generally
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
interpreted interpreted to uh
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
You Know cover things topics like epr uh
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
but the charge of that group is so broad
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
that I think representative evil has
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
expressed to me that it couldn't hurt to
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
have another group uh you know dive a
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper into this and maybe
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the solid waste working
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
group on this kind of topic so we see no
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
harm in in looking into the issue it's
 
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:22.340 align:start position:0%
obviously a very complicated issue
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
and the devils are always in the details
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of how you implement them
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and how you know that's what defines
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
how they're how they're how effective
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
they can be but it's something I think
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
we we the department would support
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
so with that happy to take any questions
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
thank you with that I have a question is
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
from a department standpoint do you see
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
any one or two or three particular
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
products that cause a great deal of
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
problem or issue with our you know with
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
disposal in New Hampshire
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I think we
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
haven't had a lot of time to sit back
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
and and look at that internally as
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
within our own day-to-day
 
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:07.850 align:start position:0%
within our own day-to-day
um

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
I I serve on the board of the Northeast
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
Recycling Council
 
00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:14.750 align:start position:0%
Recycling Council
um

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
and through my work with that group I am
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
aware of what other states have
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
implemented in terms of epr programs and
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
where they started a lot of them started
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
with electronics recycling due to the
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know how they're those those
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
types of material like Electronics
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
products tends to have tend to have uh
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of precious metals and sometimes
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials that should be
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
recovered and not not sent to the solid
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
waste stream so that's where a lot of
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
States I think initially started they
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
also started with things like paint
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
which is also something that tends to to
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
cross over into the world of hazardous
 
00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:52.850 align:start position:0%
cross over into the world of hazardous
waste

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so looking at things from a toxicity
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint that's that's where some
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
states have started there's also
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
uh you know more recently especially in
 
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.310 align:start position:0%
uh you know more recently especially in
Maine

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
um you know the cost of managing these
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
materials and not just the toxicity
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
um you know not just a concern about
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
toxicity but also how much of these
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
things we're generating and how much of
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
it ends up in our landfills or
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
incinerators so they're looking at
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
things like packaging more generally
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
that that is a very complex topic
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so epr can be taken in any number of
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
um so epr can be taken in any number of
directions

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
directions
 
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.049 align:start position:0%
directions
um

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:29.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
but in terms of from what I'm familiar
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
with at least States seem to have taken
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
a more uh at least initial steps around
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
toxicity and identifying those items
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
that are pose more of a risk from that
 
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.750 align:start position:0%
that are pose more of a risk from that
standpoint

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
is it your in your opinion
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
that a study committee would be more
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
successful if they if if it weren't as
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
broad if maybe we just looked at
 
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.250 align:start position:0%
broad if maybe we just looked at
um

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
a dozen things or you know half a dozen
 
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.049 align:start position:0%
a dozen things or you know half a dozen
things

00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:02.059 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we might want to focus in on in
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
terms of epr
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that that could help uh with
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
narrowing the focus a little bit could
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
potentially make it a more
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
productive uh conversation and focus the
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
the direction of the group a little bit
 
00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
the direction of the group a little bit
more

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
um I hadn't really given consideration
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
to how that might be done but that that
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
is possibly uh uh that could be a
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
beneficial Amendment to the Bill thank
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
beneficial Amendment to the Bill thank
you

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.690 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
question

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
um to your point about uh packaging and
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
the complexities if memory serves me
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
correct I think you also were there way
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
back when in hb617 when we discussed
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
multi-layer packaging and the various
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
complexities around it as well as
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
um many many of those other types of
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
packaging which are not necessarily
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
recoverable in a way and they ultimately
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
end up landfilled
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
um so to that end uh I I am wondering
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
I I guess I will push back a little bit
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
on whether or not narrowing the scope
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
would potentially eliminate looking at
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
things that we should really
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
focus on and so I'm just curious as to
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
how how we Define that scope if if
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
you're looking for an amendment
 
00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question to be
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
clear I'm not advocating for an
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
amendment I would just uh opining that
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
potentially that could help in terms of
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
I know with study committees they often
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of time uh to really
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
focus on the issue uh at hand because of
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
deadlines and you know reporting
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
deadlines and whatnot
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just thinking that it could
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
potentially be beneficial to to identify
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
priorities or topics or even material
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
types or product types
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
um but I I see where you're coming from
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Murray that that there is
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
such a broad potential application for
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
epr that
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
you know I just don't know what the best
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
the best methodology is to tackle it
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
because it is such a broad complex topic
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not I'm fear I'm not being
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
very helpful but that's it's the nature
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
of the Beast I think
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you very
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair I was also wondering
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
about packaging and I was thinking about
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of places I'm from
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
Keene and in Keene we have a couple of
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
places now that uh when you get coffee
 
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know the entire the the Cup itself
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh and the you know the the thing that
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
keeps your hand from getting too hot
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
forget what that's called uh and the lid
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
are all compostable right I assume that
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
the lid is maybe cornstarch based or
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
something like that and the same would
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
be true you know if you bought a cup of
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
soup or something like that so I was
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is any effort uh on
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
the part of the department and part of
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
the state to kind of uh particularly
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
with that kind of packaging to move us
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
further in the direction of that kind of
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
packaging right as opposed to I mean how
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
many you stop into Cumberland Farms or
 
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.020 align:start position:0%
any other place you can still get
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
styrofoam cups for your coffee right and
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
other uh containers that really just
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
fill our landfill when clearly there is
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
the technology that allows us to produce
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
containers that are compostable so I'm
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
wondering number one if that might fall
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
into the purview of this kind of study
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
and if anything is currently in the
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
works to help us move in the direction
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
of that kind of Packaging
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:39.889 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
um

00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of what currently might be
 
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
happening uh the department has issued a
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
solid waste management plan uh back in
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
late 2022 it identifies a number of
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
strategies and actions some of it
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
could could apply to the kind of
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
situation you're talking about where
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
reducing use of certain types of
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
packaging or reducing single-use
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
packaging or in
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage more recycling or
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
recyclability of Inc of that type of
 
00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:09.590 align:start position:0%
recyclability of Inc of that type of
Packaging

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
Packaging
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
um one of the challenges is that we
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
a way to make that happen for sure but
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
we can encourage we can educate we can
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
provide information so that's that's one
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the challenges with moving the needle
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
so to speak on these kinds of social
 
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:27.500 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
I think that's where epr the intention
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
of epr is to
 
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:36.140 align:start position:0%
create a framework that kind of requires
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and product Brands to
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
adhere to some sort of code or some sort
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
of standard
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
for their products
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
if the onus is on the manufacturer or
 
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
the brand for end of life management
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
as a profit driven
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
business they are probably going to opt
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
for materials and packaging that are
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
less expensive to manage at the end of
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
life so to your point you know
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
compostable packaging or things that can
 
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
go to higher and better use that
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
potentially could be recycled and have
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of market value
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
as a commodity are going to be something
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
that they would probably be more willing
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
to kind of direct their efforts to
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
if they don't have to think about what
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
the the end of life management of their
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
packaging is then they're just going to
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
continue business as usual status quo so
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
so I think that's where APR comes in is
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
it really tries to
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
create some sort of economic incentive
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
essentially because at the end of the
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
day the business is going to be
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
the one that foots the build you know so
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to look to minimize costs
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
wherever they can I hope that answers
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
your question yes can I follow up Madam
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
chair sure follow up uh and like
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
speaking of that kind of incentive right
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
which it makes sense right so even if
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
there were some costs that is that is
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
passed on to the consumer for example
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
when you buy your your cup of coffee I
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
bought my cup of coffee in the morning
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that there would be an
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
offset potentially as we're dealing with
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh diminishing landfill space and and
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
increasing prices for landfills right
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
because we have to now truck waste
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
greater distances because we're running
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
out of landfill space it seems that
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
perhaps for consumers uh there would be
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
an offset even if there's a small you
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
know increase in what you're paying for
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
that cup of coffee uh because of of the
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
packaging that it would be offset
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
potentially by savings or keeping our
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
landfill costs from continuing to
 
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.629 align:start position:0%
landfill costs from continuing to
increase

00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a fair assessment thank
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Dusty I can't take your
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions because you introduced the
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm sorry for that
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
chair I think this discussion that we're
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
having before us if I may illustrates
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
how complex the issue really is and how
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
many different products epr really
 
00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:05.150 align:start position:0%
many different products epr really
touches

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
touches
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
and uh to that end uh
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
I think that it is
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
what your vision for the study
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee's communication with the solid
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
waste working group does that directive
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
need to be in the bill
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
to that end you were saying potentially
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
there was hope that the two could
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
communicate with one another
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make sure if that
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
the named members were working on that
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
that they have the ability to
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
communicate with you directly or how how
 
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
would that work for swag I guess is what
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
a good question
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I have the answer
 
00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:46.970 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I have the answer
um

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
I I I just think that if because the the
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
topics could overlap between the two
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
groups there may
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
it may be beneficial to have some
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
coordination but I don't know if that
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
needs to be formalized I would leave
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
that to the committee to to think about
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know how to craft the
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair may it wasn't a
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to answer
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative germanna is that allowed
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
or not if not that's fine
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't believe so because we are
 
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative so that uh discussion
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
between committee members is something
 
00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:29.390 align:start position:0%
between committee members is something
that

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
um is typically done in uh study uh
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
study session uh subsequent to the
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
hearing because the hearing gives
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
anybody no thank you I appreciate you
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying thank you and now
 
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
um Mr John Tuthill from my town of
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
Acworth welcome to environment
 
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.270 align:start position:0%
Acworth welcome to environment
agriculture

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman members of
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is John Tuthill
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
from Acworth in Sullivan County
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
um a quarter of a century ago I was
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
sitting on this committee and we were
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
talking about epr and these Concepts
 
00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:20.579 align:start position:0%
at that time so I'm very pleased that
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is coming forward and I
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
strongly support it uh
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
I suppose this gratuitous to say that
 
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's long overdue but it certainly is
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
time for us to be discussing this
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
um Michael Nork from Des essentially
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
covered what I think is is really the
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
critical issue which is focusing on
 
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.950 align:start position:0%
critical issue which is focusing on
toxicity

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
toxicity
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of our difficulties with Solid
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
Waste Management
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
have to do with the fact there actually
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
is a great deal of toxic material in the
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
way streams we're using waste streams
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
the way we used to use Rivers before the
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act started
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
putting some controls on that you have a
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
great flow of material passing through
 
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:04.460 align:start position:0%
and we have a small segment of
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
of waste materials that really are quite
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
hazardous but by diluting them in a much
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
greater stream of
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
of papers and cardboard and just general
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
household refuse
 
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.589 align:start position:0%
household refuse
um

00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's possible to
 
00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:22.940 align:start position:0%
send these materials off into the world
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
where they are treated to some extent or
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
controlled at landfills or incinerators
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
or wastewater treatment plants but
 
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.710 align:start position:0%
or wastewater treatment plants but
nonetheless

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the end a lot of this talks and
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
material is getting back out into the
 
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:36.980 align:start position:0%
environment into our
 
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
agricultural lands and into Food
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
Supplies so I think that's where epr can
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
really make a difference in terms of
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
protecting the environment and
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
improving public health or reducing risk
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
to Public Health perhaps would be a
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
better way of putting that I'll leave it
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
at that I said I would speak for one
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
minute I just really wanted to see I
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
strongly support this this initiative
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm very pleased it's happening
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
having lived in Europe at the time that
 
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.589 align:start position:0%
having lived in Europe at the time that
uh

00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
epr was coming into effect through the
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
European Union you saw a dramatic change
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
in packaging and a reduction in the
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
amount of materials that were being used
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
in packaging consumer goods thank you
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative Murray uh
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
 
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.849 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
question

00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about toxicity
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
and packaging can you elaborate a little
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
bit more about how the two interrelate
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
are there are there
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
things added to packaging that make them
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
not only more complex but also more
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
toxic uh yes
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and a quarter of a century ago this
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
was perhaps more of a problem because
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
actually industry manufacturers have
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
adapted and to some extent there have
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
been laws at the federal and and I think
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
to some extent at the state level the UF
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
stabilizers in Plastics you have
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
colorants what makes those detergent
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
bottles almost jump off the shelf into
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
your cart is in a very very bright
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
colors which often are associated with
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
heavy metals
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
the stabilizers themselves can be a
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of toxicity
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
we certainly know now about pfas which
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
is often found in Packaging
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed and I think
 
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.310 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed and I think
that

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
sending an economic signal through an
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
epr program would would be useful in
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
reducing the use of some of these
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
chemicals in in the recipes for
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
packaging both in paper and in Plastics
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure thank you madam chair uh
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
going back to the comment on uh pfas and
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
packaging are you referring to non-stick
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
Coatings in general or what are what are
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
you what are you uh I mean obviously
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
pfas is a chain of chemicals and there
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
are many pfas correct
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
um are there other non-stick Coatings
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
that are of concern to you or I'm
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
certainly not an expert in this field I
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
mean I've been following
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
um the story for many many years this is
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
not something new exactly if you can go
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
back to Rachel Carson or people like
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
Theo Colburn back in the 90s we've known
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
about a lot of these uh problematic
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
chemicals for a long time that are used
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
in the Plastics manufacturing industry
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
and and were used more at one time in
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
the paper industry
 
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.470 align:start position:0%
the paper industry
um

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
but no I I actually can't uh discourse
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
in depth on on the actual particulars of
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
of these chemicals there certainly are
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
experts who can do that and hopefully
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
the study committee would actually Avail
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr Tuthill
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for coming
 
00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:47.579 align:start position:0%
and joining us this morning
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I I would like to ask the
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee I see that the sponsor of the
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill has joined us does anybody from the
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee actually have a question for
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor yes
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative partial would you please
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
take the seat I would love to
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll make sure shortly thank you
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
so go ahead representative Bixby you had
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
I asked a couple of questions of
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
Representative dutzie which uh through
 
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
which the answer was she couldn't read
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
your mind but she kind of guessed that
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
you what your response might be so I'm
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
gonna just play put them to you uh in
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
terms of potentially amending the bill
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh one issue uh is simply the matter of
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh reducing the number of Senators to
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
one so we'll have at least one who might
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
show up uh and the other question is uh
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
do you think it might make sense to
 
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.089 align:start position:0%
do you think it might make sense to
um

00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh in the committee charge make uh
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
provide a a list of potential areas to
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
look at to clarify because this is a
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
huge topic to clarify some priorities
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and uh
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
welcome I'd like to say thank you
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to justify
 
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to justify
um

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
I my only concern with uh
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
with one Senator and three
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
Representatives is that it opens the
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
door for uh Thai votes but I am more
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
than open to it if that's the will of
 
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
this uh Ena committee I would be more
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
than happy to offer such an amendment
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
um as far as out there is uh there are a
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
number of concerns about EPA legislation
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
what IT addresses we for Testimony this
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
morning about the difference between
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
addressing electronic technology and the
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
disposal of our plastic bottles I think
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
that both are very valid points to look
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
at where you have one committee to study
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
all of them it makes sense and again I'd
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to have include areas
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
of potential outline like I think was
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
given to my testimony it's written
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
testimony addressing these various
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
concerns yes
 
00:44:02.089 --> 00:44:02.099 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you have my uh something else to add
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
what more thought if I may
 
00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
what more thought if I may
um

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
and that is uh
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
this bill is for a study group because I
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
really do feel that the issues posed by
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
this are quite large but I think at the
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
end of the day the focus of this is
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
something that we all not only
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
decreasing our waste flow of something
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
well in favor of but also giving some
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
relief to the municipal taxpayers who
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
are paying the Tipping fees in these
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
towns I think that's also vital to
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
address it as part of this bill
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and so it
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to what representative
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
Bixby had said about
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
um perhaps restricting or or having the
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
scope of the study be more specific
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps um would you think it be a good
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
idea for the study committee to decide
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would want to
 
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.870 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would want to
restrict

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
a study of you know just certain items
 
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.510 align:start position:0%
a study of you know just certain items
or

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
so that they are not you know having to
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
deal with such a broad issue that
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps they can determine what the
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
priorities would be for what they're
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
going to study
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
well I'd be happy to furnish a hopefully
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list of areas be examined
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
I would not presume on the study
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee on what they wish to on the
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
areas they wish to focus on I think that
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
sounds perfectly reasonable thank you
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.410 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair thank you for taking my
question

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
um you have a comment in here about
 
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.710 align:start position:0%
um you have a comment in here about
soliciting

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
soliciting
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee deems relevant who do you
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
think about oh sorry who do you think
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
about when you talk about that because
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
it seems like that might help also
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
Define the goals as to who you solicit
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
information from
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh what do I want to say people like
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
outside of Des who are other
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
organizations that you would want to
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
there are a number of uh
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
waste groups around the state the New
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Network for one in ten towns
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
initiative uh I think they may also may
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
have some worthy testimony uh I would
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
also think perhaps our Municipal
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
Association may have some worthwhile
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
input when it comes to how we're
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
currently managing our waste flow and
 
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
improvements in that area
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
um there's two that let's come off the
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
top of my mind
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh to that end uh
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
I guess would you
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
would you believe that's okay yeah thank
 
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.809 align:start position:0%
would you believe that's okay yeah thank
you

00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
um that there are a large range of
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who would come and testify
 
00:46:58.569 --> 00:46:58.579 align:start position:0%
on those as I have experienced through
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
hb617 everybody from retailers
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to hospital associations
 
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
the list is quite broad would you not
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
agree I would agree and I think maybe
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
one of the tasks of the study could be
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
might have is trying to avoid redundancy
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
of testimony because of that factor I'd
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
like to see your time sweat wisely thank
 
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.970 align:start position:0%
like to see your time sweat wisely thank
you

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
taking the question um I sort of asked
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
this of Representative Desi earlier
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and maybe I can phrase it a little
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
bit better this time given the broad you
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
know sort of um Mandate of the bill
 
00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
um how how would you define the the
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
report outcomes like what what are the
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
specific goals that you that you would
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
I would be happy
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
if we could come to a consensus on
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to move the whole concept of
 
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
EPA epr forward in the state I that is
 
00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
the goal of this study group I believe
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so and I said earlier that that it
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
could be that the report basically
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
establishes that there is an epr and is
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate or that there is an
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
existence of APR do you anticipate that
 
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:20.060 align:start position:0%
it would name
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
materials or or
 
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:23.690 align:start position:0%
materials or or
um

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
specific companies or or
 
00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:28.730 align:start position:0%
specific companies or or
producers

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
producers
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
I would again hate Brazil man what the
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
studies what findings of the committee
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
may make
 
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
may make
um

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
but I think that at the minimum if you
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
identify a stewardship organization to
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
manage the waste flow and some
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
guidelines and how for collection I
 
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
think that at a minimum would be perhaps
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
a wise area for the committee to look at
 
00:48:50.339 --> 00:48:51.890 align:start position:0%
a wise area for the committee to look at
or

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.530 align:start position:0%
or
yes

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
partial uh and in connection with
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Howard's question I see
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
uh you're one of the provisions of of
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
the bill would be uh suggested
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
legislation in order to help
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
RSA 149 am in order to better meet the
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goals therein so I
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
assume one of the uh possible outcomes
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
of such a committee would be to perhaps
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
suggest some pieces of legislation maybe
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's taking legislation that has been
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
enacted in Maine or other states and and
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
and and then crafting it in a way that
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
that suits the interests of New
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I assume that uh potential
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh would also be a product
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the committee's work
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
I think that's an implicit in the uh
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
um in the in the bill
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%

house bill
253.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:08.940 align:start position:0%

seeing none I will then close this
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
hearing I also want to report that we
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill and on the online
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
portal we had 62 people in favor of this
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill three people against and one person
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%

yes yeah did you get that 62 in favor
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
three opposed and one neutral
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
um do we have your written testimony
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
or I could submit it electronically if
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
you prefer
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a paperless person whatever you
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
okay I am going to
 
00:51:17.339 --> 00:51:19.010 align:start position:0%

um

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going to adjourn our
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee I thought we would have more
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
people speaking in favor or against this
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
bill this uh this morning but uh our
 
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
next hearing is at one o'clock uh for HB
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
56 relative to permits for the sighting
 
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
of new landfills
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
and so we will be taking off that time
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
until then representative Bixby yeah I'd
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
just like to uh recommend that uh we
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
probably should uh spend some time in a
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
work session on this in order to
 
00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
um just clarify any any possible
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
necessary amendments does that I had
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
planned to do that next week great in
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
the morning good thank you so I don't
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
know if there would be any
 
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.230 align:start position:0%
know if there would be any
um

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
notion of bringing uh an amendment
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
before then
 
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
I think that might be a possibility
 
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.010 align:start position:0%
I think that might be a possibility
um

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
we can talk with a prime sponsor and see
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
what he'd be amenable with and see if we
 
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.250 align:start position:0%
what he'd be amenable with and see if we
can

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
get some rough draft or something put
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
together so we have something to discuss
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
So the plan is for next week uh in the
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
morning I wanted to have a work session
 
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
on this bill as well as that I'm
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
assuming we're going to have some
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
discussions on the landfill sighting
 
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.470 align:start position:0%
discussions on the landfill sighting
bills

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
um to have a work session in the morning
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
for these three bills there's also
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.890 align:start position:0%
another bill
um

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a HB 221 and I think that there was
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
that that's the land acquisition bill
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
for the land trust and I think that you
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
were working on an amendment for that
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll be preparing an amendment for
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
that okay so those four bills we can
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
talk about uh in a work session next
 
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.750 align:start position:0%
talk about uh in a work session next
week

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
in the morning and in the afternoon
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have an exact session and I'm not
 
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.870 align:start position:0%
we'll have an exact session and I'm not
sure

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
if we want to include these three bills
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we're going to hear today in the
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can just get the
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
landfill can you put your um microphone
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
in I don't think that we can figure out
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
what needs to happen with the landfill
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%

02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
mute their phones
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to have any cell phones
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
going off in the middle of our hearings
 
02:27:32.929 --> 02:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:32.939 --> 02:27:35.330 align:start position:0%

02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
first of all I'd like to have a reminder
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
of some civility we do not impugn or
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
ascribe motives to others or you will be
 
02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:46.870 align:start position:0%
ascribe motives to others or you will be
gaveled

gaveled
 
02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
so we want to be respectful of
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's position on on these two
 
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
bills this afternoon

realize that hb602 is very similar you
 
02:28:09.650 --> 02:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
may speak on both bills at the same time
 
02:28:11.929 --> 02:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
but if you are coming back up to speak
 
02:28:16.010 --> 02:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
on hb602 please stay specific to that

bill
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
and try not to repeat something that's
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
already been said we've got a lot of
 
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
people who want to speak
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to be respectful of
 
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:36.349 --> 02:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh so with that I will start with
 
02:28:36.359 --> 02:28:37.730 align:start position:0%
uh so with that I will start with
um

02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:40.250 --> 02:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Murray to introduce her
 
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
bill HB 56 to our committee
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good afternoon
 
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative good afternoon to you too
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee uh for the
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Megan
 
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
Murray I represent the towns of Amherst
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
in Milford I'm here before you uh to
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
bring forward House Bill 56 which is a
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill that would establish a distance of
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
a distance to travel requirement for the
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh proposed sighting of landfills and in
 
02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
uh proposed sighting of landfills and in
that

02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
um what what the bill is asking for is
 
02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
that any uh applicants seeking to cite a
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
landfill uses a five-year distance to
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
travel calculation in a hydrogeological
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
study that would be at the expense of
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the applicant
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
um putting that forward the bill itself
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
is the the bill itself is is similar in
 
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
nature to uh the bill we saw last year
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
however I did want to make some mention
 
02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
that I was aware that
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
um there were a few things that could
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
potentially be strengthened and so in
 
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
doing so I have prepared an amendment
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
which you all have which is zero six
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
zero nine h
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
and IT addresses a few things with
 
02:30:00.170 --> 02:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
regard to strengthening some of the
 
02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
definitions around
 
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
for a pre-existing landfill in
 
02:30:09.410 --> 02:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
subparagraph C it also mentions uh in
 
02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
subparagraph C
 
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:12.550 align:start position:0%
subparagraph C
lines

02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
8 through 10 that we also would like to
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
see that any perennial bodies of water
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
traversing a footprint uh be monitored
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
in accordance with or exceeding U.S EPA
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulations and guidelines it also in
 
02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
subparagraph D of the original Bill
 
02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
continues to further elucidate elusive
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me elucidate
 
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
um The Five-Year distance to travel and
 
02:30:44.809 --> 02:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
it just says that we would also like
 
02:30:46.849 --> 02:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
that there's not more than an additional
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
three years added to the calculated time
 
02:30:50.330 --> 02:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
of travel
 
02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:51.050 align:start position:0%
of travel
um

02:30:51.050 --> 02:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
and um there are a few other very
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
scientific explanations which some folks
 
02:30:59.710 --> 02:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
behind me will speak to better about
 
02:31:03.889 --> 02:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
in-situ soils and I I am not the person
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
to speak to the scientific uh nature of
 
02:31:07.439 --> 02:31:08.330 align:start position:0%
to speak to the scientific uh nature of
that

02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll happily take any
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have for me um
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
like I said
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
um that the body uh last year the house
 
02:31:18.889 --> 02:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
felt very strongly that the house take a
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
position and
 
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:21.650 align:start position:0%
position and
um

02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are protecting our
 
02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
bodies of water and so in doing so we
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that happens and
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
so this is a vehicle that I believe uh
 
02:31:34.849 --> 02:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
is best suited to do that
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions
 
02:31:38.809 --> 02:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
representative Murray representative
 
02:31:38.819 --> 02:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
representative Murray representative
Crichton

02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:43.370 --> 02:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and so this bill
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
is similar to a bill from last term
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
the bill from last term was vetoed
 
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
by the governor how does this build get
 
02:31:58.490 --> 02:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
by that beetle
 
02:31:59.570 --> 02:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative so I do believe that
 
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I I cannot speak to what is in the
 
02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:08.090 align:start position:0%
um I I cannot speak to what is in the
governor's

02:32:08.090 --> 02:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
02:32:11.210 --> 02:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
purview so to to that I will say that we
 
02:32:14.690 --> 02:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
are taking an additional uh
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
angle to try and make sure that folks
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
feel as comfortable as possible to
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
02:32:23.650 --> 02:32:23.660 align:start position:0%
um we are
 
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
not trying to
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
um impinge on any pre-existing landfills
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
that are in existence and in in doing
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
I would at least hope that that gives
 
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
some additional reinsurance that we
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a service that
 
02:32:43.730 --> 02:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
is provided to folks but at the same
 
02:32:45.530 --> 02:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
time we are also concerned about water
 
02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:48.110 align:start position:0%
time we are also concerned about water
quality

02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%

in the news these days recently in an
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
East Palestine Ohio there was a major
 
02:33:40.969 --> 02:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
train derailment that has caused nothing
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
short of a humanitarian crisis
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
while people in my town of Merrimack
 
02:33:47.570 --> 02:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
have been systematically poisoned over a
 
02:33:49.610 --> 02:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
few decades these people have been
 
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
poisoned overnight we are seeing photos
 
02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
of dead fish chickens birds people are
 
02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
complaining of headaches skin rashes and
 
02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
difficulty breathing
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
make no mistake
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own because of
 
02:34:07.610 --> 02:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
this ecological crisis they will lose
 
02:34:10.429 --> 02:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
their houses lose their town and many
 
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
will end up losing their how their
 
02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
health and even their lives
 
02:34:16.370 --> 02:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
because of poisonous chemicals that have
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
been spewed into the environment by
 
02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:20.809 align:start position:0%
been spewed into the environment by
industry

02:34:20.809 --> 02:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to what is happening
 
02:34:25.070 --> 02:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack however like I said earlier
 
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
it's taken us decades to reach a Tipping
 
02:34:30.349 --> 02:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
Point instead of getting there overnight
 
02:34:32.929 --> 02:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
but make no mistake we are also losing
 
02:34:35.809 --> 02:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
our houses our town our health and in
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
some cases we are losing our lives
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
our culprit is pfas chemicals released
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
by an industrial polluter in our town
 
02:34:45.650 --> 02:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's in our water our soil it's in our
 
02:34:47.389 --> 02:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
air when they incinerate their waste at
 
02:34:47.399 --> 02:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
air when they incinerate their waste at
night

02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
night
 
02:34:50.410 --> 02:34:50.420 align:start position:0%
those of us with contaminated Wells
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
cannot sell our houses who is going to
 
02:34:54.889 --> 02:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
buy a house with water that makes you
 
02:34:54.899 --> 02:34:56.090 align:start position:0%
buy a house with water that makes you
sick

02:34:56.090 --> 02:34:56.100 align:start position:0%

02:34:59.090 --> 02:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
our pets cats and dogs are dying in

02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
they are the true canaries in the coal
 
02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:05.870 align:start position:0%
they are the true canaries in the coal

02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
mines
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals are hormone disruptors
 
02:35:11.450 --> 02:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
everything in your body is run by
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
hormones if you question the power of
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
hormones you have never had a teenage
 
02:35:15.479 --> 02:35:16.849 align:start position:0%

son

02:35:16.849 --> 02:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
son
 
02:35:19.490 --> 02:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything is run by hormones
 
02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
and when they are disrupted excuse me
 
02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
chaos ensues
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
because this has been going on so long
 
02:35:28.969 --> 02:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
our residents are getting sick we have
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
high rates of autoimmune disease high
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%

02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:35:38.270 --> 02:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
I have one of those cancers that is
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
linked to pfas contamination I had my
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
blood tested and my levels are so high
 
02:35:45.710 --> 02:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
that my blood is considered toxic I had
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
to remove parts of my body in an effort
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
to eliminate a cancer Target before my
 
02:35:52.969 --> 02:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
cancer could get to it that's right the
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
price to live in a town that is
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
contaminated with pfas chemicals is to
 
02:35:59.270 --> 02:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
amputate parts of our bodies to try to
 
02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
stay ahead of the anticipated damage
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
my surgeon after running several genetic
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
tests has stated that my cancer is most
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
likely a result of environmental toxins
 
02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
now I can't say for certain that pfas
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
gave me cancer but when something is
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
looking like a duck and quacking like a
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
duck and when your oncologist after
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the research agrees then one
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
might say with reasonable confidence
 
02:36:25.010 --> 02:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
that we have a duck here
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
but think about what that statement
 
02:36:28.370 --> 02:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
about environmental toxins is really
 
02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:29.389 align:start position:0%
about environmental toxins is really
saying

02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
an industrial polluter most likely gave
 
02:36:33.650 --> 02:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
me cancer because they couldn't control
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
what they were releasing
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
here's the thing about pfas chemicals
 
02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
you can't taste them you can't smell
 
02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
them you can't even see them in water
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
but by the time you discover they are in
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
the water it's too late these are
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals that are called
 
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
forever because they cannot be destroyed
 
02:36:53.809 --> 02:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
once they are released into the
 
02:36:56.210 --> 02:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
environment they are there for good
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
we have an industrial polluter in our
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
town but another source of pfas
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals is from landfills all of the
 
02:37:05.570 --> 02:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
pizza boxes Burger wrappers Glide dental
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
floss and even stain resistant cloth in
 
02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
landfills contain pfas chemicals
 
02:37:13.610 --> 02:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
to think that a landfill would not Leach
 
02:37:16.969 --> 02:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
is to be naive of course they will leech
 
02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
and to place a landfill within 200 feet
 
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
of a body of waters to condemn that
 
02:37:23.929 --> 02:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
water to Future contamination with not
 
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
only pfas but with all of the other
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of toxic chemicals that are
 
02:37:30.349 --> 02:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
found in trash
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
a CBS article recently stated that
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
eating a pfas contaminated fish is
 
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent to drinking a month's worth
 
02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
of pfas contaminated water
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
once again once it's discovered in the
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
water it's too late for the environment
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
and for the people who live there they
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
will eventually lose their homes their
 
02:37:50.929 --> 02:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
Community their health and in some cases
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
their lives now I get it Americans are
 
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
consumers we buy things and we throw
 
02:37:59.210 --> 02:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
away a lot of things until we can get on
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
top of our consumerism we're going to
 
02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
need landfills no one is arguing that
 
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
but what I'm saying is that we can take
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
care of our garbage in a reasonable and
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
safe way and that means not locating
 
02:38:14.929 --> 02:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
toxic garbage near any body of water
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of land in New Hampshire
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
to fill with our trash and it makes me a
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
little sad to even say that
 
02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
we must start putting the health and the
 
02:38:25.490 --> 02:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
welfare of people who live in New
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first or over corporate greed
 
02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
Our Lives literally depend upon it I
 
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
urge you to support House Bill 56 and to
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
send it OTP to the house floor thank you
 
02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions thank you
 
02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas any questions
 
02:38:43.610 --> 02:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh Walter I'm sorry pardon me I didn't
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
read it right
 
02:39:10.270 --> 02:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes I'm speaking on my paper copy and my
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
first remorse will be regarding both
 
02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
bills but I'd like to also speak to some
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
of the specifics about 602 a little bit
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
later this afternoon as well
 
02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
so I am a um
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
a retired uh scientist and I'm trying to
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
find my notes here oh too many too many
 
02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:34.130 align:start position:0%
find my notes here oh too many too many
documents

02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
documents
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I can just remember what I said
 
02:39:40.490 --> 02:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a retired biologist and I um
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
have worked for 35 years on
 
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
finding pollution and also finding
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
solutions to pollution so I have seen
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
firsthand how leaching of pollutants can
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
poison Waters forever
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
I say in my remarks we tracked how
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
surface activities contaminated ground
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
Waters and also traveled to in-stream
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
discharges by we I mean the group of
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
people that I worked with in
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania for over 20 years that
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
included State energy experts at agency
 
02:40:16.969 --> 02:40:16.979 align:start position:0%
experts um university civil and
 
02:40:16.979 --> 02:40:18.429 align:start position:0%
experts um university civil and
Engineering

02:40:18.429 --> 02:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
Engineering
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
civil and environmental Engineers from
 
02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
universities and so forth
 
02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
so when we track those surface
 
02:40:27.410 --> 02:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
activities and saw them impact both
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
ground Waters and streams we saw also
 
02:40:33.050 --> 02:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
the drinking water wells were became
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
unusable streams were missing fish and
 
02:40:38.450 --> 02:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
the invertebrates they eat and property
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
values plummeted
 
02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
um this does not need to happen because
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
of poor landfill citing I strongly
 
02:40:49.490 --> 02:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
support both bills because both bills
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
use well-established principles of
 
02:40:53.690 --> 02:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
hydrology to cite landfills a major
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
source as we know of groundwater
 
02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:57.410 align:start position:0%
source as we know of groundwater
pollution

02:40:57.410 --> 02:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
pollution
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
for example both bills use the distance
 
02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
calculated you just heard of The
 
02:41:03.290 --> 02:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
Five-Year groundwater travel time from
 
02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
landfill drainages to sensitive
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
receptors and I'll speak a little bit
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
more about those sensitive receptors and
 
02:41:12.530 --> 02:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
protecting them um in when I talk later
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
about number 20 602 but to make the
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
these both come together this approach
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
has has these benefits predictability
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders both the all the
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
landfill companies current businesses
 
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
prospective businesses residents and
 
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal managers can plan their work
 
02:41:34.010 --> 02:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
to maintain Water Resource protection
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
when water resources are more
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
predictable property values are stable
 
02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
and new businesses are confident to join
 
02:41:43.969 --> 02:41:43.979 align:start position:0%
the local economy
 
02:41:46.330 --> 02:41:46.340 align:start position:0%
also under drinking water protection
 
02:41:49.010 --> 02:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
private wellwaters are better protected
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
about half of granite Staters rely on
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
private Wells
 
02:41:55.849 --> 02:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water managers can plan
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
treatments for each Municipal Source
 
02:41:59.809 --> 02:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
without surprises and costly
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
compensations example my city had to
 
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
spend two 27 million dollars to upgrade
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
water treatment for industrial
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
groundwater pollutants but that wasn't
 
02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
enough one area was leaching extremely
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
serious contaminants and so the company
 
02:42:19.969 --> 02:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
on their dime had to pay for to install
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
special treatments meanwhile those took
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
years to get in place so meanwhile the
 
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
city has stopped using that well water
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
source under those contaminated lands
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
this forced water restrictions for all
 
02:42:35.929 --> 02:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
of the city when we had a moderate
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
drought during the last two years
 
02:42:41.090 --> 02:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
all this water contamination and
 
02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions could have been avoided
 
02:42:46.849 --> 02:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
please move both bills forward and let's
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
let the details get worked out with the
 
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
expertise of several independent
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
hydrology experts and then we can toast
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
to a vigorous safe future for New
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with a good clean glass of
 
02:43:03.889 --> 02:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
water thank you thank you Ms Walter any
 
02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:06.140 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:43:10.010 --> 02:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to call Mike wimsat from
 
02:43:15.410 --> 02:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Des to come and speak and
 
02:43:15.420 --> 02:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Des to come and speak and
testify

02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
Mike wimsat I serve as director of the
 
02:43:55.010 --> 02:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
02:43:58.730 --> 02:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
Services and joining me today I have
 
02:44:00.170 --> 02:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
assistant Commissioner of our department
 
02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
Mark Sanborn
 
02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:44:07.969 --> 02:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
testify regarding House Bill 56 as as
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the from the bill
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill would essentially
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
require Des to establish the
 
02:44:17.450 --> 02:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
site-specific setback distance for new
 
02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh post new landfills from any perennial
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
surface waters and it provides that that
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
setback distance should be sufficient to
 
02:44:27.650 --> 02:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
keep any groundwater that's been
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
contaminated by the landfill from
 
02:44:32.090 --> 02:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
reaching any nearby surface waters
 
02:44:34.250 --> 02:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
within a five-year period
 
02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:36.260 align:start position:0%
and the way that it goes about
 
02:44:39.410 --> 02:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
establishing that setback distance is to
 
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
have an independent hydrogeologist
 
02:44:45.050 --> 02:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
um do site-specific testing on the site
 
02:44:47.270 --> 02:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
and determine to in order to estimate
 
02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
groundwater seepage velocity and then
 
02:44:51.889 --> 02:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
using the highest seepage velocity
 
02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
estimated for the site that is used to
 
02:44:57.050 --> 02:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
determine the five-year setback distance
 
02:44:57.060 --> 02:44:58.270 align:start position:0%
determine the five-year setback distance
and

02:44:58.270 --> 02:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
also the bill does provide which I'll
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
speak to in a moment some for it
 
02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
provides for the establishment of
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
project Improvement allowances and each
 
02:45:10.849 --> 02:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
of those can add basically to offset a
 
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
one year of travel time distance for up
 
02:45:16.010 --> 02:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
to up to up to up to three years
 
02:45:17.809 --> 02:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor did make reference to an
 
02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
amendment but I have not seen that
 
02:45:23.809 --> 02:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I won't my testimony will
 
02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:26.300 align:start position:0%
not address the content of the amendment
 
02:45:29.690 --> 02:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
DS has several concerns with the bill
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the provisions of the bill as it's
 
02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
been introduced first it's not clear to
 
02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
us how the five-year travel time
 
02:45:37.849 --> 02:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
distance has been established as the
 
02:45:40.610 --> 02:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate standard we've expressed you
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
know even going back to last year some
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
concern that that may have an impact on
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
whether any future landfill sites will
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
be available in the state we just don't
 
02:45:52.250 --> 02:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
know that at this point so that's a
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
concern that we have second the
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
provision that requires the use of the
 
02:46:00.170 --> 02:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
highest estimated rate
 
02:46:02.270 --> 02:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
um is is a little unclear to us how that
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be implemented but
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
based on how we understand
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater Hydro geologic testing to
 
02:46:12.889 --> 02:46:12.899 align:start position:0%
take place on sites it seems possible to
 
02:46:14.929 --> 02:46:14.939 align:start position:0%
us that an individual measurement could
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
be made in a particular area of soil on
 
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
a site and that using that particular
 
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
measurement could result in erroneously
 
02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:24.730 align:start position:0%
measurement could result in erroneously
identifying

02:46:24.730 --> 02:46:24.740 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
a a a setback distance that is actually
 
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
much greater than would actually need in
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
other words you might end up making an
 
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
estimate of groundwater seepage velocity
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
that is much faster than the actual
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
velocity of groundwater traveling to a
 
02:46:41.809 --> 02:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
particular surface water so we're a
 
02:46:44.050 --> 02:46:44.060 align:start position:0%
little concerned about how the bill
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
would instruct the hydrogeologists and
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
Des to establish that groundwater
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
seepage velocity and then lastly there's
 
02:46:54.290 --> 02:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of detail related to
 
02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:55.270 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of detail related to
these

02:46:55.270 --> 02:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
project Improvement allowances and it's
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
unclear to Des what specific actions or
 
02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
or improvements are intended by that and
 
02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
we think that would require further
 
02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:08.170 align:start position:0%
we think that would require further
further

02:47:08.170 --> 02:47:08.180 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
specificity and the other thing I would
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
say is that we are and everyone knows
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of bills in play
 
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
before the legislature this year
 
02:47:19.490 --> 02:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
regarding this topic of landfill
 
02:47:21.410 --> 02:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
setbacks particularly to surface water
 
02:47:26.030 --> 02:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
the agency is monitoring a bill Senate
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 which is somewhat similar to
 
02:47:31.309 --> 02:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and there's some talk as we
 
02:47:33.469 --> 02:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
understand it I think I I was President
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
Ford but I understand maybe an amendment
 
02:47:37.969 --> 02:47:37.979 align:start position:0%
was approved this morning by the senate
 
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
committee which would combine this
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 61 with Senate Bill 227
 
02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that would essentially
 
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
instruct Des to hire a consultant or
 
02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
contractor to do an independent uh
 
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate critical evaluation of setback
 
02:47:56.330 --> 02:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
requirements in the existing rules and
 
02:47:58.849 --> 02:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for changes and we
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe that you know both of these
 
02:48:03.050 --> 02:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
bills could could actually particularly
 
02:48:05.230 --> 02:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
if they're combined could
 
02:48:08.210 --> 02:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
provide a good effective strategy for
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
protecting surface waters and
 
02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
determining what appropriate landfill
 
02:48:13.849 --> 02:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
setbacks would be from surface waters
 
02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave it at that and be happy
 
02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon everyone I'll just add
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
really quickly uh again for the record
 
02:48:24.770 --> 02:48:24.780 align:start position:0%

Services
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
um given this topic and how many bills
 
02:48:32.570 --> 02:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
there have been and how long this is
 
02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
going on we've been often asked you know
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
our positions and as the Director
 
02:48:39.650 --> 02:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
indicated Des believes the best path
 
02:48:43.010 --> 02:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
forward is the combined version of SB 61
 
02:48:47.290 --> 02:48:47.300 align:start position:0%
and SB 227 therefore on the remaining
 
02:48:49.849 --> 02:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
house and any Senate bills that have
 
02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
been presented on this uh were not
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of moving forward uh in a
 
02:48:59.570 --> 02:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
different direction other than SB 61
 
02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
combined with 227 SB 227 and and how
 
02:49:05.570 --> 02:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
that uh indicates that would have us
 
02:49:07.849 --> 02:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
move forward so we think that's in the
 
02:49:09.889 --> 02:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
best interest of the state and in the
 
02:49:11.809 --> 02:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
best interest of uh dealing with this
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
issue with that we're happy to take
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:49:19.010 --> 02:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
and I have a question as to
 
02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other states that
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
use this
 
02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:24.309 align:start position:0%
use this
um

02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
five-year travel distance measurement
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes I'm aware that
 
02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine does have some
 
02:49:34.429 --> 02:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
similar language
 
02:49:37.849 --> 02:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
um it has some as with any every state
 
02:49:40.610 --> 02:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
has a different sort of uh structure and
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
organization to their rules so they
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily directly comparable
 
02:49:46.670 --> 02:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
but I understand that Maine does have a
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
similar similar Provisions in its rules
 
02:49:51.410 --> 02:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
and do you know how long they've had
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
this provision in law for them at all I
 
02:49:56.809 --> 02:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically I think it's
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
been in law for quite some time and I
 
02:50:01.690 --> 02:50:01.700 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
there are a number of
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
we have had last year we had some
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
conversations with our with our
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues in Maine and came to
 
02:50:13.010 --> 02:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
the the way that they implement the law
 
02:50:18.110 --> 02:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
I can't say I completely understand it
 
02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
but it was a little different than what
 
02:50:23.330 --> 02:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
we were reading in in in this law or in
 
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill or in bills that were before
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature in discussions with your
 
02:50:28.849 --> 02:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
with your colleagues in Maine have you
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
found that they've had any problems
 
02:50:33.530 --> 02:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
implementing it or haven't had any
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
problems with it in general
 
02:50:37.969 --> 02:50:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can answer that I
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
understand that they do have a provision
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
for providing variances to various
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
provisions of the rules and I don't
 
02:50:46.550 --> 02:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
really understand what the history is on
 
02:50:49.070 --> 02:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
providing those variances okay thank you
 
02:50:50.770 --> 02:50:50.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative germanna thank you madam
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:50:57.469 --> 02:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
and it's uh to piggyback on the
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
chairwoman's question with regard to
 
02:51:02.210 --> 02:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
Maine or uh in other states with your
 
02:51:05.270 --> 02:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
second listed concern about the
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of getting uh seepage
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
velocity measurement in one place which
 
02:51:12.889 --> 02:51:12.899 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate
 
02:51:16.190 --> 02:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
um how is it done in other places is
 
02:51:18.650 --> 02:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
there I I would have assumed but perhaps
 
02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
out of naivete or ignorance that there
 
02:51:23.090 --> 02:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
is a procedure that would involve taking
 
02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
measures in numerous uh places in order
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
to try to determine an average of
 
02:51:31.070 --> 02:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
seepage velocity Etc so is there in
 
02:51:34.130 --> 02:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
Maine or elsewhere a standard way to
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
attain an accurate measure I apologize I
 
02:51:38.690 --> 02:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
don't specifically know how Maine
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that my testimony on this
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill was based on the way we read the
 
02:51:47.330 --> 02:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
language in this bill and what to put a
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
little bit more flesh on that concern it
 
02:51:53.809 --> 02:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
would appear that you it seepage
 
02:51:55.130 --> 02:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
velocity is something that can be
 
02:51:57.290 --> 02:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
determined in a relatively small area of
 
02:51:57.300 --> 02:51:58.730 align:start position:0%
determined in a relatively small area of
soil

02:51:58.730 --> 02:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
soil
 
02:52:01.130 --> 02:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and there are there are published
 
02:52:03.050 --> 02:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
methods for for making those estimates
 
02:52:04.490 --> 02:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
doing doing field measurements and
 
02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
making those estimates and of course
 
02:52:09.170 --> 02:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
certainly the geology in New Hampshire
 
02:52:11.929 --> 02:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
is very variable the formations are very
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
heterogeneous and the idea that one
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
individual test in one area of soil
 
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
would then be used to determine
 
02:52:22.610 --> 02:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
the path and the path both the pathway
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the velocity of groundwater over
 
02:52:26.630 --> 02:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
what could be a very large distance that
 
02:52:29.389 --> 02:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
sees a lot of soil changes just doesn't
 
02:52:32.809 --> 02:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
seem it doesn't seem sound to to us as
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
we look at it
 
02:52:36.290 --> 02:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
could I may have follow-up sure uh and
 
02:52:38.450 --> 02:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
and would you with reference to the
 
02:52:40.730 --> 02:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
Senate bills and the idea of of getting
 
02:52:43.250 --> 02:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
a hydrogeologist to consult I imagine
 
02:52:46.490 --> 02:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
this would be one of the things that you
 
02:52:48.410 --> 02:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
would be looking for that consultant to
 
02:52:50.990 --> 02:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
provide feedback on sure if you're
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
referencing Senate Bill 227 yes we think
 
02:52:56.269 --> 02:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
that uh part of that study should very
 
02:52:58.490 --> 02:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
likely should include a review of the
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
neighboring states uh or the Region's
 
02:53:04.250 --> 02:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
State rules and and a critical
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
assessment of those to determine what
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate and applicable for
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
for use by New Hampshire
 
02:53:13.130 --> 02:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
02:53:15.769 --> 02:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
uh representative Knapp
 
02:53:17.090 --> 02:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you referenced the
 
02:53:20.929 --> 02:53:20.939 align:start position:0%
project Improvement allowances in your
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
letter for the commissioner does
 
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and I know you said you didn't have
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment in front of you but the
 
02:53:28.730 --> 02:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
amendment references those including
 
02:53:30.769 --> 02:53:30.779 align:start position:0%
additional control technology monitoring
 
02:53:32.809 --> 02:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
programs or funding guarantees that the
 
02:53:34.250 --> 02:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
department believes may increase the
 
02:53:36.530 --> 02:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
effective safety of the project so do
 
02:53:38.570 --> 02:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
you believe Des is capable of evaluating
 
02:53:40.849 --> 02:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
what those additional improvements might
 
02:53:43.070 --> 02:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
be and
 
02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
um changing the travel time or adjusting
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
it based on that or giving
 
02:53:50.330 --> 02:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
credits for that I have no doubt that
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
our staff could could come up with what
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
they think are appropriate things to
 
02:53:57.050 --> 02:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
consider when I compare the bill to
 
02:53:58.910 --> 02:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 61 for example Senate Bill
 
02:54:01.849 --> 02:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
61 sets out much more specifically what
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
those might look like and really the the
 
02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
nature of the comment in this letter of
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the language in this
 
02:54:11.929 --> 02:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
bill is very is very is not very
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
specific and what we're really
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting is much more specificity is
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
is helpful because obviously when we go
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
to rule making
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
um we we do the very best we can to do
 
02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
an honest assessment and interpretation
 
02:54:26.269 --> 02:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
of the law but to the extent that the
 
02:54:28.370 --> 02:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
law is a little more specific it gives
 
02:54:29.929 --> 02:54:29.939 align:start position:0%
us a lot better Direction
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just want to add to that
 
02:54:36.290 --> 02:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
point that's at the heart of the reason
 
02:54:39.410 --> 02:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
we feel the combined version of 61 and
 
02:54:43.490 --> 02:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
227 SB 227 is the best approach forward
 
02:54:45.650 --> 02:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
as the folks are going to be asked to
 
02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
implement this because it uh it allows
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
us to work with um we put out an RFP we
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
would have a hired Consultants who would
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
have specific tasks to look at we'd have
 
02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
the research we needed the data we
 
02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:02.630 align:start position:0%
the research we needed the data we
needed

02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
um before we go into assuming what the
 
02:55:06.889 --> 02:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
rulemaking should look like we think
 
02:55:10.690 --> 02:55:10.700 align:start position:0%
that's just a much more effective way of
 
02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
managing this issue so that we can be
 
02:55:15.530 --> 02:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
sure what we'd bring forward in rule
 
02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
making is in the best interest of all
 
02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
the policies impacting the state of New
 
02:55:20.100 --> 02:55:22.490 align:start position:0%
the policies impacting the state of New
Hampshire

02:55:22.490 --> 02:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh so um
 
02:55:31.730 --> 02:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
on under your current permitting
 
02:55:34.849 --> 02:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh landfills and for
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
landfill expansions do you require any
 
02:55:41.690 --> 02:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
Hydro geological assessments of uh
 
02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
groundwater velocity or seepage velocity
 
02:55:50.170 --> 02:55:50.180 align:start position:0%
certainly the for any proposed uh
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
expansion or newly cited landfill there
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
is a detailed Hydro hydrogeological
 
02:55:59.210 --> 02:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
study that is required and that would I
 
02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if groundwater seepage
 
02:56:03.230 --> 02:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
velocity I just and I don't know whether
 
02:56:05.929 --> 02:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
it is specifically listed in the rules
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
but the rules do require a collection of
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of detailed information regarding
 
02:56:13.570 --> 02:56:13.580 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology and the kinds of
 
02:56:15.290 --> 02:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic parameters and
 
02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
characteristics that would be measured
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
and evaluated would would lead you to
 
02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
being able to determine that follow-up
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh would those procedures
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
provide a better model for uh the uh for
 
02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure how to answer that
 
02:56:40.010 --> 02:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
because the the current rules don't
 
02:56:42.769 --> 02:56:42.779 align:start position:0%
Envision calculating a travel time
 
02:56:42.779 --> 02:56:44.630 align:start position:0%
Envision calculating a travel time
distance

02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
distance
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
um from the uh the landfill footprint to
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
a surface water not at least not
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically so to the extent that a
 
02:56:56.570 --> 02:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
future Paradigm for these rules includes
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
calculating a travel time distance they
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
may there may well be May well need to
 
02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
be some additional instruction or or
 
02:57:08.210 --> 02:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
Direction provided for that
 
02:57:12.050 --> 02:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yes so uh what is
 
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the current uh uh uh
 
02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
seepage uh assessments that you do
 
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
the overall purpose is to understand the
 
02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:23.510 align:start position:0%
the overall purpose is to understand the
site

02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
site
 
02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:24.230 align:start position:0%
site
um

02:57:24.230 --> 02:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
in a in a detailed way in terms of its
 
02:57:30.769 --> 02:57:30.779 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology its stratigraphy and how
 
02:57:30.779 --> 02:57:32.750 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology its stratigraphy and how
groundwater

02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
02:57:34.730 --> 02:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
um both from from a drainage surface
 
02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
water and a groundwater drainage
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
standpoint but also contaminant
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
transport a lot of it is about making
 
02:57:42.250 --> 02:57:42.260 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
a effective and protective groundwater
 
02:57:47.389 --> 02:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring Network can be established
 
02:57:49.969 --> 02:57:49.979 align:start position:0%
around the site and in order to do that
 
02:57:51.530 --> 02:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
you need to have an understanding of
 
02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
what the what the subsurface environment
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
looks like so you want to understand
 
02:57:58.250 --> 02:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
what the stratigraphy is what the
 
02:58:01.370 --> 02:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
layering and deposits of of uh you know
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
of sand and gravel and play and silt
 
02:58:06.349 --> 02:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
might be because that helps instruct you
 
02:58:09.650 --> 02:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
on how you on being able to demonstrate
 
02:58:12.530 --> 02:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
that you can effectively monitor release
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
potential releases from the site and
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
then how to actually construct and
 
02:58:19.070 --> 02:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
install that monitoring Network
 
02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
oh one more follow-up yeah and
 
02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
is the goal of that monitoring Network
 
02:58:29.269 --> 02:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
to uh make sure that there is nothing
 
02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
going into the groundwater at that site
 
02:58:33.950 --> 02:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
or is it in terms of making sure that
 
02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
nothing travels away from the site or is
 
02:58:38.090 --> 02:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
it both
 
02:58:39.950 --> 02:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably both what really
 
02:58:41.570 --> 02:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
what what we're trying to do with any
 
02:58:43.849 --> 02:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
landfill and and we start with the
 
02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
designable landfill to ensure that
 
02:58:47.870 --> 02:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
leachate from the landfill is is
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
collected effectively and and stored and
 
02:58:54.889 --> 02:58:54.899 align:start position:0%
and and processed properly and that any
 
02:58:56.990 --> 02:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
leachate that the landfill generates is
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
collected by in the first instance the
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
primary liner or failing that the
 
02:59:04.490 --> 02:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
secondary liner and so the the
 
02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
monitoring the groundwater monitoring
 
02:59:08.450 --> 02:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
that we do around a landfill basically
 
02:59:11.330 --> 02:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement to understand what
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
the current conditions are prior to
 
02:59:15.650 --> 02:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
construction landfill cell in terms of
 
02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
how groundwater flows but also what the
 
02:59:19.610 --> 02:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
quality of the groundwater is so the
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
geochemical parameters of the
 
02:59:22.969 --> 02:59:22.979 align:start position:0%
groundwater and then when you go into
 
02:59:25.550 --> 02:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
modern you're required to do periodic
 
02:59:26.929 --> 02:59:26.939 align:start position:0%
monitoring under your groundwater
 
02:59:29.570 --> 02:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
release detection permit for a landfill
 
02:59:33.469 --> 02:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
and then whenever you go concentrations
 
02:59:36.230 --> 02:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
of any contaminants or geochemical
 
02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:37.370 align:start position:0%
of any contaminants or geochemical
parameters

02:59:37.370 --> 02:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
02:59:42.010 --> 02:59:42.020 align:start position:0%
go above the established background that
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
launches the the applicant in the in the
 
02:59:47.090 --> 02:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
holder of the permit into more intensive
 
02:59:49.490 --> 02:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
monitoring to determine you know what
 
02:59:51.950 --> 02:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
what this what the what the trend is and
 
02:59:53.929 --> 02:59:53.939 align:start position:0%
and to determine whether there's been a
 
02:59:55.849 --> 02:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
release from the landfill and then if
 
02:59:57.170 --> 02:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's been a release from a landfill
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement to go into active
 
03:00:02.269 --> 03:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
active remedial steps to to to to to
 
03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
stop that release and contain it
 
03:00:08.269 --> 03:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question to piggyback
 
03:00:10.610 --> 03:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
on that as well as your answer
 
03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
so with what you've just described
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
how would you do that within a current
 
03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback
 
03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:20.750 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback
well

03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:00:22.429 --> 03:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
what I think a lot of people don't
 
03:00:24.590 --> 03:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
understand is that we have Century
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells immediately adjacent to
 
03:00:31.550 --> 03:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:00:34.429 --> 03:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
landfill liner so basically if you were
 
03:00:36.010 --> 03:00:36.020 align:start position:0%
to look at a footprint of a landfill
 
03:00:38.210 --> 03:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
immediately adjacent to that often
 
03:00:40.730 --> 03:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
within 50 feet of that there are
 
03:00:43.130 --> 03:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells that are monitored to
 
03:00:45.530 --> 03:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
determine groundwater quality
 
03:00:47.630 --> 03:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
immediately adjacent in outside of the
 
03:00:51.530 --> 03:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
liner so those and
 
03:00:55.490 --> 03:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
we we sometimes do see uh
 
03:00:57.530 --> 03:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
detections of contaminants that cause
 
03:00:59.290 --> 03:00:59.300 align:start position:0%
this concern
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
we've not seen them as a result of liner
 
03:01:04.130 --> 03:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
leaks what we've seen is that in some
 
03:01:07.250 --> 03:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
cases surface water runoff
 
03:01:07.260 --> 03:01:07.969 align:start position:0%
cases surface water runoff
um

03:01:07.969 --> 03:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:11.030 --> 03:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
from the landfill May May because of a
 
03:01:13.309 --> 03:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
mistake or an error may contact waste
 
03:01:15.889 --> 03:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
and and contribute some
 
03:01:18.950 --> 03:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh contaminants to
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
to the groundwater it's or or in some
 
03:01:23.690 --> 03:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
cases the surface water runoff that goes
 
03:01:26.230 --> 03:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
into discharge basins surface water
 
03:01:28.670 --> 03:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
infiltration basins around the landfill
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
and the good news is that we see those
 
03:01:34.130 --> 03:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
results very very quickly and there
 
03:01:35.690 --> 03:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
there are some examples of where we've
 
03:01:38.330 --> 03:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
identified that and then required
 
03:01:40.130 --> 03:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
immediately the landfill operator to
 
03:01:42.410 --> 03:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
investigate they find out where the
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
mistake has been made or where the where
 
03:01:46.849 --> 03:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
the problem is occurring they fix it and
 
03:01:50.090 --> 03:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
then we see the groundwater restore the
 
03:01:52.370 --> 03:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
ground to meet groundwater quality that
 
03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
that the pre-existing groundwater
 
03:01:56.330 --> 03:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
quality in many cases what we've
 
03:01:58.849 --> 03:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
observed isn't even above a drinking
 
03:02:01.130 --> 03:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
water standard it's just above what we
 
03:02:03.650 --> 03:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
saw in the background groundwater and so
 
03:02:06.830 --> 03:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
we see it early enough to then go and
 
03:02:11.389 --> 03:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
require corrective measures and then we
 
03:02:13.429 --> 03:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor as that groundwater
 
03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
quality is restored to the background
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
quality and do you have an idea of how
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
long those corrective measures take to
 
03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:21.830 align:start position:0%
long those corrective measures take to
implement

03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
implement
 
03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:23.150 align:start position:0%
implement
um

03:02:23.150 --> 03:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:25.730 --> 03:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
well I think it really depends on the
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance in many cases the actual
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
corrective measure doesn't take very
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
long it's the time taken to figure out
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
what's going on so in some cases we may
 
03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
have several months or a few quarters of
 
03:02:39.650 --> 03:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
monitoring before we actually get to the
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
bottom of the problem and then Implement
 
03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of a solution
 
03:02:46.370 --> 03:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:02:48.889 --> 03:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
representative knabb thank you madam
 
03:02:48.899 --> 03:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
representative knabb thank you madam
chair

03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
um do you know about when the 200 foot
 
03:02:53.990 --> 03:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
setback was enacted and when was the
 
03:02:55.849 --> 03:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
last time standards around landfall
 
03:02:57.730 --> 03:02:57.740 align:start position:0%
sightings were
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
changed or updated
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you say the second part
 
03:03:04.250 --> 03:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
of your question again I I'm just sort
 
03:03:06.530 --> 03:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
of curious It's a history of regulations
 
03:03:08.570 --> 03:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
around landfill citing so you have a 200
 
03:03:10.910 --> 03:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
foot setback currently right right how
 
03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
long has that been in existence and is
 
03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
that the last time that
 
03:03:17.410 --> 03:03:17.420 align:start position:0%
laws around landfill citing were updated
 
03:03:20.210 --> 03:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
I think I I don't know how long that 200
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
foot setback has been there I know it's
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
been there for quite some time it's it's
 
03:03:25.130 --> 03:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
many years I believe but I don't know
 
03:03:26.929 --> 03:03:26.939 align:start position:0%
how many
 
03:03:29.570 --> 03:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe we've had we did do a
 
03:03:32.410 --> 03:03:32.420 align:start position:0%
rulemaking back in I think around 2014
 
03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
where there was some setback
 
03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
requirements but I don't believe they
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
were related to surface water I think
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
they were related to roads and
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
Residences and private property and that
 
03:03:42.889 --> 03:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
03:03:42.899 --> 03:03:45.349 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
um

03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:48.230 --> 03:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so
 
03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:49.010 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so
um

03:03:49.010 --> 03:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
do you think that 200 foot setback is
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate or do you think it needs to
 
03:03:54.650 --> 03:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
be Revisited
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
well I I'm to be to be really candid I'm
 
03:04:00.769 --> 03:04:00.779 align:start position:0%
anxious to see I I we are hopeful that
 
03:04:02.450 --> 03:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
the study that's envisioned by Senate
 
03:04:05.630 --> 03:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 227 will be
 
03:04:08.269 --> 03:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
um will be will be implemented and and
 
03:04:11.690 --> 03:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
I'm anxious to hear what a third-party
 
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
expert has to say about these setbacks
 
03:04:18.830 --> 03:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
important to understand that the in
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
practice that setback has typically
 
03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
really only been applied to
 
03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:25.610 align:start position:0%
really only been applied to
um

03:04:25.610 --> 03:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:28.969 --> 03:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
Wetland and and very minor surface water
 
03:04:31.250 --> 03:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
features I don't think I don't think we
 
03:04:31.260 --> 03:04:32.690 align:start position:0%
features I don't think I don't think we
have

03:04:32.690 --> 03:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:33.950 align:start position:0%
have
um

03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:36.170 --> 03:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I I'm really not aware that we have
 
03:04:38.450 --> 03:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
any landfill footprints that are just at
 
03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
200 just just at that setback 200 feet
 
03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
from a particular surface water so it's
 
03:04:47.090 --> 03:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
what I will tell you is that we don't
 
03:04:50.809 --> 03:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
have examples of
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
um perennial surface water is being
 
03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
impacted above surface water quality
 
03:04:57.530 --> 03:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
standards by contaminants from the land
 
03:05:01.730 --> 03:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
the currently operating landfills
 
03:05:03.410 --> 03:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy
 
03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I just want a
 
03:05:10.490 --> 03:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
point of clarification
 
03:05:14.030 --> 03:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
um Mr wamsa did you say that
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
um based on this bill you would find it
 
03:05:19.610 --> 03:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
hard to maybe cite any landfills in the
 
03:05:19.620 --> 03:05:21.110 align:start position:0%
hard to maybe cite any landfills in the
state

03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:05:23.330 --> 03:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
no I think thank you for the question
 
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative I think what I said was
 
03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
that it's not clear to us if you
 
03:05:30.410 --> 03:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
were to
 
03:05:32.570 --> 03:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
implement this bill as introduced
 
03:05:32.580 --> 03:05:34.250 align:start position:0%
implement this bill as introduced
whether

03:05:34.250 --> 03:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:05:36.650 --> 03:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
um what that what that would mean for
 
03:05:38.450 --> 03:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
future landfill citing in the state
 
03:05:40.670 --> 03:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're not sure that
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
um given the the way that New Hampshire
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
geology is and the way the occurrence of
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
surface waters in the state it's unclear
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
to us what sites might meet that the
 
03:05:55.150 --> 03:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure yeah the reason I asked the
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
question is because we we've been given
 
03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
a map
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
um based on uh only one seventh of New
 
03:06:06.110 --> 03:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is excluded by The Five-Year
 
03:06:08.330 --> 03:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
groundwater system
 
03:06:10.730 --> 03:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and this the source was uh New
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des 2011
 
03:06:16.010 --> 03:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
um so I mean you know there's some kind
 
03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
of a conflicting thing there certainly
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
is I'm familiar with that map I can tell
 
03:06:21.650 --> 03:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
you that the gentleman at DES who made
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
that map was very dismayed to see how it
 
03:06:26.030 --> 03:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
was being used with respect to a bill
 
03:06:27.889 --> 03:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
last year and this year
 
03:06:29.330 --> 03:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
um that as I understand it is a
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
stratified drift aquifer map it does not
 
03:06:36.170 --> 03:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
purport to identify areas where
 
03:06:37.969 --> 03:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
um a five-year travel time distance
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
would exist the reality is that that is
 
03:06:43.250 --> 03:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
so site-specific we're not we don't have
 
03:06:44.690 --> 03:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the information we would
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
need to make a map like that
 
03:06:49.130 --> 03:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
um so that map is really being misused
 
03:06:52.730 --> 03:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative germana
 
03:06:58.969 --> 03:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh my first
 
03:07:02.050 --> 03:07:02.060 align:start position:0%
question is not having seen Senate Bill
 
03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
227 what is the timeline on that bill in
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of a report back
 
03:07:10.010 --> 03:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
um my understanding well and I think
 
03:07:12.170 --> 03:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's been a a
 
03:07:15.650 --> 03:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
an amendment that combined the that bill
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
was Senate Bill 61. I've not had a
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
chance to sit down and read that
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I think the original version
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 227 uh puts it at about
 
03:07:28.849 --> 03:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh completing the study on the order of
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
well in time to do rulemaking within two
 
03:07:33.769 --> 03:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
years that's my understanding thank you
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
mate follow-up Madam chair yes uh thank
 
03:07:38.030 --> 03:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
you and uh in general how long does it
 
03:07:40.130 --> 03:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
take to to cite a landfill right so that
 
03:07:42.590 --> 03:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation refers to any proposed
 
03:07:44.929 --> 03:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
new landfill so roughly from the time
 
03:07:48.110 --> 03:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
that you know a company were to propose
 
03:07:50.690 --> 03:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
citing a landfill in the in the time
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that permission is granted roughly
 
03:07:55.010 --> 03:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
how long does that take so that that's a
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
tough question to answer if you just
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
look at the law you would conclude that
 
03:08:01.790 --> 03:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
um basically an application comes in and
 
03:08:03.650 --> 03:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
if everything's perfect we approve that
 
03:08:05.690 --> 03:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
we find the application complete within
 
03:08:08.090 --> 03:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
60 days and then we render a decision
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
within 120 days in practice for the for
 
03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
such a big undertaking as a proposing
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
and citing a newly I did Greenfield's
 
03:08:18.830 --> 03:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
landfill the chances of that application
 
03:08:21.050 --> 03:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
being complete upon first submittal are
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
slim not not because applicants do a
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
poor job of submitting but there's just
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
a lot that you have to provide so we
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
would do a review and determine what
 
03:08:32.030 --> 03:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
things were missing and then we would
 
03:08:34.490 --> 03:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
ask for those new information to be
 
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
provided and then that would come in and
 
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
then the clock starts over again in
 
03:08:40.849 --> 03:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
practice uh it's it's probably a
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
I am going to warn you that we should
 
03:08:51.050 --> 03:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
not be talking discussing Senate bills
 
03:08:52.670 --> 03:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
especially we don't have anything in
 
03:08:54.710 --> 03:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
front of us about it so
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
um I would like to suspend any
 
03:08:58.610 --> 03:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
discussion about that Senate bills that
 
03:09:02.210 --> 03:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:03.349 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:09:09.230 --> 03:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for your
 
03:09:11.690 --> 03:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure yep
 
03:09:16.370 --> 03:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
I would like to bring up Sebastian
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
Fuentes who said uh who is uh
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
from Woodlands Road and uh asked for one
 
03:09:27.950 --> 03:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:29.929 --> 03:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon Madam
 
03:09:31.490 --> 03:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the community thank
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
you for uh taking my testimony today uh
 
03:09:36.050 --> 03:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
my my primary my full-time job is a
 
03:09:37.610 --> 03:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
movement politics director for rice and
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
democracy of New Hampshire I don't think
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
I put it on the sheet but I'm also a
 
03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
resident of the North Country for the
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
last 22 years
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
when I moved to New Hampshire 21 years
 
03:09:47.450 --> 03:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
ago uh you know I went straight to the
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
North country because it's a beautiful
 
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
area uh you know we have amazing Rivers
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
the parks uh you know all the activities
 
03:09:55.969 --> 03:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
you can do there and uh and the reason
 
03:09:57.530 --> 03:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
when I'm here is because we know about
 
03:09:59.450 --> 03:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
this project that is happening or this
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
plan to be happening in the North
 
03:10:02.929 --> 03:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
Country which is a Casella waste uh
 
03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
landfill in the Dalton Whitefield area
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
near Forest Lake now uh while living in
 
03:10:11.210 --> 03:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
the North Country I also performed a job
 
03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality industry I worked for
 
03:10:15.170 --> 03:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
two of the grand hotels of New Hampshire
 
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
which is the mountain view grand in
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
Whitefield and the omnivore Washington
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
and Breton woods so uh while doing that
 
03:10:23.630 --> 03:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
job many times a guests will ask me uh
 
03:10:25.490 --> 03:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know where can we go to enjoy the
 
03:10:26.929 --> 03:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
you know the White Mountains the rivers
 
03:10:28.130 --> 03:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
and the lakes and everything I always
 
03:10:30.050 --> 03:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
send them to the Forest Lake Area I
 
03:10:31.730 --> 03:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
always send them to the yamunus River or
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
the pemi River or the connect River
 
03:10:35.389 --> 03:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River for fishing any other
 
03:10:37.849 --> 03:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
activities I'm really concerned as the
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
resting of another country about what
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
this project might happen so that's what
 
03:10:42.469 --> 03:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
I'm here to ask you the committee to
 
03:10:44.809 --> 03:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
support HP 56 because I think that's the
 
03:10:46.730 --> 03:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do uh you know and
 
03:10:49.370 --> 03:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
also I keep thinking about
 
03:10:52.130 --> 03:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
how can we think about placing a
 
03:10:53.809 --> 03:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
landfill another one because we already
 
03:10:55.849 --> 03:10:55.859 align:start position:0%
have one in Bethlehem New Hampshire in
 
03:10:57.410 --> 03:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
the middle of the White Mountains of New
 
03:10:58.969 --> 03:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is one of our Prime
 
03:11:01.250 --> 03:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
touristic attractions especially for
 
03:11:03.290 --> 03:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
folks that work and Thrive from the
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry in the North
 
03:11:06.530 --> 03:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
Country so I'm giving my testimonial as
 
03:11:08.750 --> 03:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
a resident and giving my testimony as a
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
as a former um Hospitality manager that
 
03:11:14.269 --> 03:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
I witnessed that if you go to Whitefield
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
and you stay at the mountain view grand
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
and you sit on the front porch you see
 
03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
the area Forest Lake why why are those
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
people going to tell future guests when
 
03:11:25.010 --> 03:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
they tell them that that mound or we're
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
looking at a brand where they're having
 
03:11:28.250 --> 03:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
enjoying their meals and the drinks is
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
actually a landfill Mount so that's my
 
03:11:32.210 --> 03:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
concern that's my what I'm bringing to
 
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
you today and I appreciate your time and
 
03:11:35.870 --> 03:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you thank you any
 
03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you I would like to
 
03:11:44.090 --> 03:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
call up uh someone named Nikki I'm sorry
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
I can't uh decipher your last name if
 
03:11:50.809 --> 03:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
you would please give your name and
 
03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:58.510 --> 03:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
so I should apologize for my handwriting
 
03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered professional geologist
 
03:12:08.929 --> 03:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I work
 
03:12:11.210 --> 03:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
for a company called verdantis we are an
 
03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
environmental Consulting and engineering
 
03:12:15.769 --> 03:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
firm with an office here in Manchester
 
03:12:17.090 --> 03:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:12:18.889 --> 03:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
03:12:21.410 --> 03:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:23.690 --> 03:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
as a registered professional geologist
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the state I have worked with the
 
03:12:28.610 --> 03:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
existing New Hampshire Des Solid Waste
 
03:12:31.010 --> 03:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
regulations regularly throughout my
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
career I've been in the business for
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
about 20 maybe 25 years if I were honest
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to just kind of point out a
 
03:12:40.969 --> 03:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
couple of things my written testimony
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
goes into greater detail but I did want
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
to cite that existing regulation EnV SW
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
80402 provides and I quote a landfill in
 
03:12:54.710 --> 03:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
all Associated leachate Storage Unit
 
03:12:56.990 --> 03:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
shall be located only in areas where
 
03:12:58.730 --> 03:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
groundwater monitoring for release
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
detection characterization and
 
03:13:03.889 --> 03:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
Remediation can be conducted prior to a
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
release having an adverse effect on
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
water supply
 
03:13:11.110 --> 03:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
along with the remainder of
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
envsw804 these existing regulations
 
03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
require an evaluation of site's proposed
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic conditions
 
03:13:20.990 --> 03:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
such that an applicant would need to
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they could
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
detect characterize and remediate and
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
impact prior to having that adverse
 
03:13:34.010 --> 03:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
impact on a sensitive receptor
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that
 
03:13:39.889 --> 03:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
applicants tend to hire geologists like
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
myself to complete an investigation on
 
03:13:44.990 --> 03:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
the property
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
these investigations are thorough and
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
quite frankly as um as uh director
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
wimsat referenced earlier are a
 
03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
representation of a wide number of
 
03:13:57.899 --> 03:13:59.750 align:start position:0%
representation of a wide number of
Investigation

03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
Investigation
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
um uh sampling and Analysis
 
03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
across the site and
 
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
those analyzes support a robust
 
03:14:12.050 --> 03:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is especially in
 
03:14:14.090 --> 03:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire always a very
 
03:14:18.889 --> 03:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:22.010 --> 03:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest challenges with House
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 56 is the reference to the maximum
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
seepage velocity being the highest rate
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
estimated for any test site in the
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
disposal area this requirement is
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and it does not reflect the
 
03:14:36.769 --> 03:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
standard geologic and hydrogeologic
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
practices or real field conditions under
 
03:14:42.410 --> 03:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
real conditions groundwater flow does
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
not follow a single highest value
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
velocity in the subsurface there are
 
03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
always outliers in our data a high a
 
03:14:52.849 --> 03:14:52.859 align:start position:0%
high-end area of gravel where there's a
 
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
high velocity represented by one single
 
03:14:58.550 --> 03:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
measurement or conversely an area of
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
very low permeability where those that
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
single measurement is very low in an
 
03:15:06.710 --> 03:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
outlier on the opposite end
 
03:15:09.170 --> 03:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
use and consideration of a single
 
03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
highest measurement is not
 
03:15:12.889 --> 03:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
representative of those exact of those
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
real feel field field conditions rather
 
03:15:18.170 --> 03:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
our thorough investigations of data
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
generally look at averages across the
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
site and work from there
 
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
HB 56 superficially appears to be more
 
03:15:29.570 --> 03:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
protective but is actually arbitrary and
 
03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
technically unjustified and it doesn't
 
03:15:34.250 --> 03:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
take into account important scientific
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
analyzes that are typically completed
 
03:15:40.010 --> 03:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
nor does it require or encourage a real
 
03:15:42.190 --> 03:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
thorough analysis of site-specific
 
03:15:45.050 --> 03:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic data
 
03:15:47.450 --> 03:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
in addition The Five-Year travel time
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
consideration included in HB 56 is also
 
03:15:52.969 --> 03:15:52.979 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and without scientific or
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
technical justification and it's far
 
03:15:57.290 --> 03:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
more conservative than is likely
 
03:16:00.230 --> 03:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessary at many sites under existing
 
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire regulations the minimum
 
03:16:04.670 --> 03:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
setback is 200 feet and I just want to
 
03:16:06.349 --> 03:16:06.359 align:start position:0%
say that one more time it is not a
 
03:16:08.630 --> 03:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
setback of 200 feet it is a minimum
 
03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:09.950 align:start position:0%
setback of 200 feet it is a minimum
setback

03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
setback
 
03:16:13.849 --> 03:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
again the requirement for that setback
 
03:16:16.849 --> 03:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
really ties back to can a applicant
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
monitor groundwater so that you could
 
03:16:24.410 --> 03:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
detect remediate any impact in time to
 
03:16:26.510 --> 03:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
prevent an adverse reaction or an
 
03:16:28.969 --> 03:16:28.979 align:start position:0%
adverse impact
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
um establishing an arbitrary time of
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
travel requirement based on a single
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
maximum measurement at a site is not
 
03:16:37.429 --> 03:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
protective it's just technically
 
03:16:40.250 --> 03:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
unjustified and unscientific so for
 
03:16:42.769 --> 03:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
those reasons I urge the committee not
 
03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
to support hb56 thank you
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you have a question
 
03:16:52.849 --> 03:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:16:55.389 --> 03:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you um
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
so uh you said that the 200 is the
 
03:17:03.290 --> 03:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
minimum and that uh it would be
 
03:17:05.950 --> 03:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
increased depending on the conditions
 
03:17:09.530 --> 03:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
and to make it uh possible to remediate
 
03:17:12.050 --> 03:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
what is the time required for for
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
remediation and how's that built into
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the actual setback that's
 
03:17:18.769 --> 03:17:18.779 align:start position:0%
established that's a great question
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know to director wimsat's
 
03:17:24.050 --> 03:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
references earlier it depends on the the
 
03:17:26.450 --> 03:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
issue at hand right and so some issues
 
03:17:28.250 --> 03:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
are much more readily available a
 
03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
readily remediated and so that time of
 
03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
travel could be very short but for a
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
typical sort of worst case scenario
 
03:17:37.429 --> 03:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
there's lots of Technology available for
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
implementation and Remediation we do for
 
03:17:43.010 --> 03:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
example pump and treat systems that can
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
make a big difference in a relatively
 
03:17:46.849 --> 03:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
short amount of time and on the order of
 
03:17:49.190 --> 03:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
a year or certainly in the order of
 
03:17:51.710 --> 03:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
quarters if it's something easier to
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
remediate and address up front
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up and uh do you know what the
 
03:18:00.230 --> 03:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
frequency of
 
03:18:02.929 --> 03:18:02.939 align:start position:0%
of modern monitoring is so haven't you
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
haven't how much time passes between
 
03:18:06.710 --> 03:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
each monitoring measurement
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
um typically it's on it's quarterly but
 
03:18:11.150 --> 03:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the provisions of
 
03:18:13.250 --> 03:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
the permit that's granted through the
 
03:18:13.260 --> 03:18:16.309 align:start position:0%
the permit that's granted through the
Des

03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
one more and uh if the uh if the ground
 
03:18:23.330 --> 03:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
with the rate of groundwater flow were
 
03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh very rapid from that from a site uh
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
would that be taken into account in the
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
process of saying what the setback would
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
be in in addition to the setback also in
 
03:18:40.610 --> 03:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
what the monitoring Well Network would
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
it look like and again that's a
 
03:18:44.330 --> 03:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
discussion between the applicant and Des
 
03:18:47.389 --> 03:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
and basically Des is able to establish a
 
03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring Network that reflects the
 
03:18:53.450 --> 03:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
actual field conditions thank you
 
03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh so I have a question
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you said the five-year
 
03:19:01.190 --> 03:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
time of travel consideration included in
 
03:19:04.370 --> 03:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
HB 56 is arbitrary and without
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
scientific or technical justification
 
03:19:09.530 --> 03:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
and is far more conservative than is
 
03:19:09.540 --> 03:19:11.030 align:start position:0%
and is far more conservative than is
necessary

03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
so if it would not be a five-year time
 
03:19:16.210 --> 03:19:16.220 align:start position:0%
of travel
 
03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
what time of travel would you find as
 
03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:21.610 align:start position:0%
what time of travel would you find as
being

03:19:21.610 --> 03:19:21.620 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:19:24.110 --> 03:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
not arbitrary
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
so one that really reflects like
 
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
conditions so I think the the trying to
 
03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
select a certain number of years right
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I think for example Maine's
 
03:19:34.969 --> 03:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
regulations actually reference six years
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is five years you know there's no
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
magic number to what how many years you
 
03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
would need what you need is a robust
 
03:19:43.490 --> 03:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
monitoring Network that is able to be
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
responsive you need a robust monitoring
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
schedule so that you can see if there's
 
03:19:51.050 --> 03:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
an issue coming and give the applicant
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
and the operator of the landfill time to
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
address to work with des and address any
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
impact that might be there again to to
 
03:20:01.130 --> 03:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
reiterate something uh director wimsat
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
said you know typically it is not
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
leaching from a landfill that's an issue
 
03:20:07.849 --> 03:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's more of a surfacial there was a
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
some sort of storm water or surface
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
water impact to a monitoring location
 
03:20:16.849 --> 03:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
and those are easy easier to address and
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
identify in a much shorter time period
 
03:20:21.230 --> 03:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:23.150 --> 03:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative NAB
 
03:20:24.650 --> 03:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
coming in to testify today I just wanted
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
I was just curious if the New Hampshire
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
Board of Professional geologists
 
03:20:31.130 --> 03:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
considered taking a position on this
 
03:20:31.140 --> 03:20:32.710 align:start position:0%
considered taking a position on this
bill

03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
so my honest response is we meet
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
relatively irregularly and so I have not
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
brought that up to the board at all so I
 
03:20:42.290 --> 03:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer and I'm certainly
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
not here in that capacity today
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton
 
03:20:50.210 --> 03:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
I guess Madam chair thank you
 
03:20:52.370 --> 03:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate your testimony I just
 
03:20:54.769 --> 03:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
wanted to see if I understood what you
 
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
said with regard to monitoring so you
 
03:20:58.849 --> 03:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
put the test well in
 
03:21:01.130 --> 03:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
water's flowing through it you detect
 
03:21:04.190 --> 03:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
bad stuff going through it
 
03:21:06.110 --> 03:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
but at that point in time the landfills
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
already existed
 
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
so what would the remediation be if the
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
landfill was already existent
 
03:21:15.170 --> 03:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
so it triggers whatever the you know
 
03:21:16.849 --> 03:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
whatever the
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
level is that it would trigger and then
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
now you go back to the people and you
 
03:21:24.050 --> 03:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
say Well it triggered it to remediate
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
how do you remediate if the landfill is
 
03:21:27.710 --> 03:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
already there well there are lots of
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
there are lots of that's a great
 
03:21:30.410 --> 03:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
question but there are lots of options
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we have at our disposal and we
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
often remediate impacts from say a
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
leaking underground storage tank for
 
03:21:39.469 --> 03:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
example right and we use those
 
03:21:41.330 --> 03:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells to identify that there
 
03:21:43.550 --> 03:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
is a leak from that you can do pump and
 
03:21:45.769 --> 03:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
treat systems there are sort of chemical
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
additions to the ground that you can add
 
03:21:51.190 --> 03:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
that help the natural biota breakdown
 
03:21:54.050 --> 03:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
contaminant in in the groundwater sort
 
03:21:56.210 --> 03:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
of in-sit you so there's lots of
 
03:21:58.190 --> 03:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
remedial technologies that are available
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
should there ever be impacts identified
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:07.490 --> 03:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you uh and
 
03:22:12.410 --> 03:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question kind of
 
03:22:14.030 --> 03:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
piggyback on representative Creighton's
 
03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
question and so that if an existing
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
landfill you know triggers that
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism and some of the remediation
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
efforts are put into place is there then
 
03:22:27.050 --> 03:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
is is there a a longer range plan for a
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
landfill that triggers that type of
 
03:22:31.010 --> 03:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
treatment so for example more frequent
 
03:22:34.070 --> 03:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
treatments are more frequent uh testing
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh the problem isn't
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
recurring so in other words is part of
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
the remediation plan
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
could you explain the remediation plan
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
and how it might play out over a period
 
03:22:48.530 --> 03:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
of years of retesting Etc certainly I
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
think it's probably a great question for
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
Des representative to answer more
 
03:22:52.910 --> 03:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
directly but
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I could imagine that if if I were
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
sitting at DES that one of the first
 
03:22:59.330 --> 03:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
things I would require was additional
 
03:23:02.050 --> 03:23:02.060 align:start position:0%
monitoring either additional analytical
 
03:23:05.450 --> 03:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
requirements or more frequent testing in
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
the in the in response to an issue that
 
03:23:10.190 --> 03:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
might have been identified
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
but that would really be driven by Des
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.410 --> 03:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming and
 
03:23:22.250 --> 03:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
testifying today I'd like to call Erica
 
03:23:22.260 --> 03:23:24.170 align:start position:0%
testifying today I'd like to call Erica
Perez

03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
03:23:33.050 --> 03:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
03:23:37.190 --> 03:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:23:39.469 --> 03:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
um my name is Erica Perez I'm
 
03:23:40.969 --> 03:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire youth
 
03:23:42.889 --> 03:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
movement and today I'm representing
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
um her testimony reads
 
03:23:51.769 --> 03:23:51.779 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and members of
 
03:23:53.570 --> 03:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Alexa Newton
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I am testifying today in support of
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
HB 56.
 
03:23:59.809 --> 03:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
I was born and raised in Littleton New
 
03:24:01.610 --> 03:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm currently working to
 
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
obtain my associate's degree in
 
03:24:06.410 --> 03:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
environmental science
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
recently I completed my final Capstone
 
03:24:12.889 --> 03:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
student-led project and it was for my
 
03:24:15.969 --> 03:24:15.979 align:start position:0%
attention focus on Casella Waste Systems
 
03:24:15.979 --> 03:24:17.710 align:start position:0%
attention focus on Casella Waste Systems
Corporation

03:24:17.710 --> 03:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the new landfill site they have been
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
working to get approved to build in
 
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
Dalton New Hampshire many regulations
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
are already in place
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
when citing a new landfill such as the
 
03:24:31.610 --> 03:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
current 200 foot buffer from the body's
 
03:24:34.190 --> 03:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
water and monitoring the groundwater but
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
we need legislation that would give
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
communities more time to monitor
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater for one it could become
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
contaminated by a landfill
 
03:24:44.450 --> 03:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
contaminations from landfills is
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
inevitable no matter how many layer
 
03:24:49.130 --> 03:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
levels of linear
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
of liner are placed in the ground even
 
03:24:53.809 --> 03:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
if it takes a hundred years for it to
 
03:24:55.490 --> 03:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
start leaking the well-being of the
 
03:24:57.290 --> 03:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
environment and the future generation
 
03:24:59.690 --> 03:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
should always be taken into account when
 
03:25:01.729 --> 03:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
the state considers permits for proposed
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
landfills new contaminations of water
 
03:25:06.530 --> 03:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
bodies from landfills are still being
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
discovered such as the presence of pfas
 
03:25:12.050 --> 03:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
which was found to have leaked into the
 
03:25:15.010 --> 03:25:15.020 align:start position:0%
groundwater from the Bethlehem landfill
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
nces I owned and operated by Casella
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
the effect to be fast on humans and the
 
03:25:23.570 --> 03:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
environment are still unknown as it is
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
still a recent discovery but this is
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
just one example of how these chemicals
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
have traveled through the groundwater at
 
03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
this highly monitored landfill
 
03:25:35.090 --> 03:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
there's no question that if the landfill
 
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
proposal in Dalton is approved the
 
03:25:38.690 --> 03:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
groundwater would become contaminated
 
03:25:41.809 --> 03:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
and in fact the wildlife of Forest Lake
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
State Park the proceeding clean water a
 
03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
forest lake and the residents who live
 
03:25:47.389 --> 03:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
near the area
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
the contaminated groundwater would also
 
03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
affect my family and I as we have a
 
03:25:54.530 --> 03:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
family lake house on Forest Lake and
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
have for multiple Generations
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
when I think of how contaminated water
 
03:26:01.729 --> 03:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
would impact the lake wildlife and
 
03:26:03.769 --> 03:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
people I know this is not the kind of
 
03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
future I would wish anyone to have
 
03:26:07.849 --> 03:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
to have to deal with just for the sake
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
of dumping our trash someplace HB 56
 
03:26:12.830 --> 03:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
would not make it impossible to cite a
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
new landfill in New Hampshire if it is
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
needed nor would it make it impossible
 
03:26:20.030 --> 03:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
for landfills for current landfills to
 
03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
expand but it would mitigate the risk
 
03:26:25.190 --> 03:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
posts to our lakes in rivers taking
 
03:26:27.530 --> 03:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
present and future groundwater flow and
 
03:26:29.630 --> 03:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
contamination into account is just as
 
03:26:31.490 --> 03:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
important as any regulation when setting
 
03:26:33.769 --> 03:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
a new landfill anywhere as a concern
 
03:26:36.530 --> 03:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
represent of New Hampshire I urge you to
 
03:26:39.190 --> 03:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
vote on to pass on HB 56 for the future
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
sake of New Hampshire's ground Waters
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
03:26:48.889 --> 03:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
I would like to Now call Dr Adam Finkel
 
03:26:57.290 --> 03:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
to come and testify if you've requested
 
03:27:05.630 --> 03:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I will definitely try to be
 
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
briefer than that I appreciate having
 
03:27:11.150 --> 03:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
that much time if
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
if need be thanks for the opportunity to
 
03:27:15.650 --> 03:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
explain why this third annual version of
 
03:27:17.929 --> 03:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
a fix for the archaic and dangerous 200
 
03:27:20.210 --> 03:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
foot setback between landfills and
 
03:27:21.650 --> 03:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
vulnerable surface waters is the best
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
version yet and should be enacted I've
 
03:27:25.610 --> 03:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
heard every conceivable objection to
 
03:27:27.769 --> 03:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
fixing this simple problem and I'd be
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
glad it's time permits to answer any
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
questions about why every one of these
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
objections is untrue desperate and
 
03:27:35.929 --> 03:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
Unworthy of your attention
 
03:27:37.490 --> 03:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to make clear I'm a
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
supporter of safe and sane landfill
 
03:27:42.290 --> 03:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
operations there was I believe only one
 
03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
person who testified at the December
 
03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
2021 hearing on the mount carvery
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
expansion you're looking at him and I
 
03:27:51.769 --> 03:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
testified in favor of that expansion
 
03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
because that site is hydrogeologically
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
sensibly cited
 
03:27:58.610 --> 03:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
so I'll just give a few assertions I
 
03:28:00.050 --> 03:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
don't like to make assertions as a
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
scientist but I'll be happy to take
 
03:28:05.690 --> 03:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
questions for what HP HP 56 is and what
 
03:28:06.889 --> 03:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
03:28:09.889 --> 03:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
it is the way that the federal EPA and
 
03:28:11.809 --> 03:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
many many U.S states have cited new
 
03:28:14.030 --> 03:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
landfills for decades any
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all setback based on
 
03:28:18.889 --> 03:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
distance ignores the simplest most basic
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
fact here contaminated groundwater can
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
flow as slowly as 20 feet per year in
 
03:28:26.809 --> 03:28:26.819 align:start position:0%
good clay soil and solid Bedrock or as
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly as 20 feet per day in sand and
 
03:28:32.030 --> 03:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
gravel and fractured Bedrock why on
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
Earth literally why on Earth would
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
anyone want to cite a landfill in the
 
03:28:37.010 --> 03:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
wrong place when there are so many
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
places that can be cited safely
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
now uh director whimsat took a shot at
 
03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
the map that we put together which I uh
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
handed out to you uh it is accurate it
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
is des's own data it does not say that
 
03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
the green areas are all suitable and the
 
03:28:55.250 --> 03:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
red areas are all unsuitable there'll be
 
03:28:58.610 --> 03:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
places in the red area where uh it's bad
 
03:29:00.650 --> 03:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
soil but far from water there'll be
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
places in the green area where it's good
 
03:29:04.490 --> 03:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
soil but too close to water but on
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
average about 86 percent of our state is
 
03:29:11.090 --> 03:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
good clay soil or solid Bedrock so the
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
idea that this will make landfilling
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
impossible is bizarre it will make
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
landfilling ever so slightly harder for
 
03:29:21.050 --> 03:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
those people who who want to dig in a
 
03:29:22.849 --> 03:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
sand pit next to a lake which is a crazy
 
03:29:25.849 --> 03:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
idea to begin with so those people have
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
to look a little harder but it is not
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
capable of changing the supply and
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
demand for landfills the analogy I like
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
to use is every public swimming pool in
 
03:29:37.969 --> 03:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
the country now has a little sign that
 
03:29:40.250 --> 03:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
says Don't dive in the shallow low end
 
03:29:42.170 --> 03:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change the supply and
 
03:29:43.969 --> 03:29:43.979 align:start position:0%
demand and the enjoyment that people get
 
03:29:46.429 --> 03:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
from swimming and Diving it says move 20
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
feet and don't break your neck it
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the price or the quantity
 
03:29:52.140 --> 03:29:53.570 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the price or the quantity
secondly

03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
this is modeled on the experience of
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
site of states that have thriving
 
03:29:59.870 --> 03:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
landfill Industries and safe sighting I
 
03:30:01.790 --> 03:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
understand from people in Maine and from
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
the people in the industry I talk to who
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
operate in Maine that it's 25 years now
 
03:30:07.849 --> 03:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
that they've had stricter guidelines
 
03:30:10.729 --> 03:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
that HP 56 would have and their landfill
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
industry is thriving The Operators know
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
that they simply have to ignore or avoid
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
the very very worst possible sites third
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's proactive all landfills will leak
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's not just an old Mantra it's a new
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
mantra I handed out a one-pager with
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
recent peer-reviewed literature that
 
03:30:32.330 --> 03:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
that says that the old Mantra that they
 
03:30:34.670 --> 03:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
will leak is still true today there are
 
03:30:36.710 --> 03:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
new landfills leaking and there are new
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
landfills that have not leaked yet
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
because they're new
 
03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how really how lay
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
people if understand how massive the
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
amounts of contaminated leachate that
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
form because of the inherent materials
 
03:30:52.849 --> 03:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
and the rainfall so I live on Forest
 
03:30:54.650 --> 03:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
Lake it's about a mile in diameter
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
depending on how much rainfall is
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
infiltrating over the lifetime of a
 
03:31:00.410 --> 03:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
landfill that would be could be cited
 
03:31:03.050 --> 03:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
there enough leachate to completely fill
 
03:31:05.210 --> 03:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
the Basin of that Lake between two and
 
03:31:07.130 --> 03:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
seven times over
 
03:31:08.330 --> 03:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about a bigger Lake
 
03:31:10.429 --> 03:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's four inches of leachate on top of
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
Lake the entire surface of Lake
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee these are billions of
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
gallons and to put it next to a river or
 
03:31:20.330 --> 03:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
lake is to use a technical term nuts
 
03:31:23.410 --> 03:31:23.420 align:start position:0%
the bill is responsive to Industry
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh request last year to add these
 
03:31:29.090 --> 03:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
technological offsets to give them extra
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
travel time based on the main system if
 
03:31:33.170 --> 03:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
someone wants to put the table of
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
offsets from Maine right into a bill
 
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's not up for me to say if Des wants
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
to develop its own rule for offsets
 
03:31:42.590 --> 03:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine too
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
it absolutely exempts existing landfills
 
03:31:48.410 --> 03:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
that wish to expand I appreciate I hope
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
we'll hear later today from Waste
 
03:31:52.429 --> 03:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
Management Incorporated who had real
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
concerns with last year's bill and I
 
03:31:56.929 --> 03:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Mary working
 
03:31:58.490 --> 03:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
with them to craft language that
 
03:32:01.969 --> 03:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
absolutely makes 110 clear this does not
 
03:32:04.670 --> 03:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
apply to to TurnKey it does not apply to
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
mount carvery
 
03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:06.889 align:start position:0%
mount carvery
Etc

03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
03:32:10.250 --> 03:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
it is appropriately precautionary many
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
many environmental standards that's my
 
03:32:14.090 --> 03:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
business for 40 years protect against
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
the reasonable worst case especially
 
03:32:18.769 --> 03:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
when companies have every incentive to
 
03:32:21.530 --> 03:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
collect data in ways designed never to
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
reveal worst case conditions
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's very odd to me that Mr Wimsatt
 
03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
would say that that the maximum measured
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
value is quote erroneous if it's not
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
erroneous it is precautionary now we can
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
argue whether it's too precautionary but
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
what really troubled me last year right
 
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
before the the override vote the people
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
at the mount Carberry landfill said the
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
same thing in a letter to the governor
 
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's erroneous to use the maximum value
 
03:32:47.690 --> 03:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
well I found that more than ironic
 
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
because the mount carvery application
 
03:32:52.849 --> 03:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
both in its initial form 25 plus years
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
ago and its expansion request a few
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
years ago uses exactly that formula they
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
are very proud of being 150 years away
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
from the androscogen using the single
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
maximum measured value if you let the
 
03:33:07.370 --> 03:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
company average they will keep
 
03:33:09.769 --> 03:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
collecting data until their average goes
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
down to where they want it to be so
 
03:33:13.250 --> 03:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's a good debate to have but don't
 
03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
you dare call it erroneous it is not
 
03:33:17.090 --> 03:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
erroneous it is precautionary and it's
 
03:33:17.100 --> 03:33:18.530 align:start position:0%
erroneous it is precautionary and it's
appropriate

03:33:18.530 --> 03:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
and finally this bill is overwhelmingly
 
03:33:22.370 --> 03:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
popular as you know eighty percent of
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
your colleagues voted for last year's
 
03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:25.729 align:start position:0%
your colleagues voted for last year's
bill

03:33:25.729 --> 03:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
what is it not it's not arbitrary yeah
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
it could be six years like Maine it's
 
03:33:34.010 --> 03:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
five years uh but realistically five
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
years is really not enough time New
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
Jersey uses 12 years it takes a long
 
03:33:42.410 --> 03:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
time to find map and then fix God
 
03:33:45.170 --> 03:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
willing if it can be fixed a plume that
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
is approaching surface water so I'd
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
prefer it be six or twelve but five is
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
it's a speed limit you know 56 miles an
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
hour 54 miles an hour we settle on 55 on
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
the interstate system
 
03:34:01.330 --> 03:34:01.340 align:start position:0%
and as I said it is not capable of
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
raising prices cutting Supply or killing
 
03:34:06.410 --> 03:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
jobs I wrote a book on this regulation
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
kill jobs the answer is generally no it
 
03:34:10.849 --> 03:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
creates jobs in roughly equal proportion
 
03:34:13.370 --> 03:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
but you can't harm the economy by making
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
it ever so slightly harder to find a
 
03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
good site there will be another landfill
 
03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
cited in the state we don't need one for
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
20 plus years but when we do we hope it
 
03:34:25.790 --> 03:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
will be cited an appropriate place and
 
03:34:28.010 --> 03:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
frankly this bill doesn't touch distance
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
but it would be nice if the next
 
03:34:32.330 --> 03:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
landfill is not 150 extra truck miles
 
03:34:34.250 --> 03:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
away from the sources of generation
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
adding more and more CO2 to the air
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
so I just have a few more sentences here
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is about 600 words long but
 
03:34:44.330 --> 03:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
all it really says is when New Hampshire
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
needs a new landfill in 20 years or more
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
it can be put anywhere except in
 
03:34:52.250 --> 03:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
hyperporous soil next to a lake or river
 
03:34:54.650 --> 03:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
under the current 200-foot setback and
 
03:34:56.690 --> 03:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
at the speed of groundwater flow that
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
our applicant and Dalton has already
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
measured itself a plume of toxic P fast
 
03:35:03.410 --> 03:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
Laden leachate could reach a water body
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
in 13 days after which it could never be
 
03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
restored without vast fast expense but
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
Des requires monitoring only every uh Mr
 
03:35:15.410 --> 03:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
Roy said three months I've seen six to
 
03:35:17.570 --> 03:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
12 month frequencies but it's way more
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
than 13 days
 
03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
I hate the term Common Sense legislation
 
03:35:22.969 --> 03:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
because everybody's idea of what's
 
03:35:25.250 --> 03:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
common sense and what's what's common in
 
03:35:27.650 --> 03:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
what sense varies but in this case where
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is so obvious the solution
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
is so easy I cannot accept anyone
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
claiming that the status quo makes sense
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
but it shouldn't be fixed before we make
 
03:35:38.210 --> 03:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
a mistake that will reverberate in this
 
03:35:40.250 --> 03:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
state for the next Century thank you
 
03:35:42.170 --> 03:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:35:42.180 --> 03:35:43.910 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative germano uh thank you
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh I take it from your
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that you don't believe that
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
current rules are as robust as uh Des
 
03:35:57.170 --> 03:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
makes them out to be could you tell us
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh why you think that the current rules
 
03:36:02.330 --> 03:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
are not adequate
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
so please understand this is a difficult
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
question for me personally because I've
 
03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
been a bureaucrat for most of my life
 
03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
I'm incredibly
 
03:36:13.010 --> 03:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh enthusiastic supporter of the
 
03:36:16.370 --> 03:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy but in this case the rules
 
03:36:16.380 --> 03:36:17.630 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy but in this case the rules
are

03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:36:21.290 --> 03:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
farcical okay Des has 44 pages of citing
 
03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
rules and many of them are very good but
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
but they deal with locate with a design
 
03:36:28.729 --> 03:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
operation post closure the citing part
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
is one and a half pages it's 30 years
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
old and it's it's vague and it's archaic
 
03:36:37.070 --> 03:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
no of you know no offense I made
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
mistakes when I was in the federal
 
03:36:41.090 --> 03:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy but Des didn't even realize
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
that for 23 years the federal Congress
 
03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
told them to update their setback
 
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
between airports and landfills the the
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
Congress passed a law in 2000 the
 
03:36:53.210 --> 03:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
Wendell Ford act that said you have to
 
03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
be six miles from an airport their rules
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
still say ten thousand feet they're just
 
03:37:01.849 --> 03:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
not able to keep up with changing law
 
03:37:04.130 --> 03:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
and changing technology and we learned
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the Concord Monitor a couple weeks
 
03:37:07.370 --> 03:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
ago I was amazed I used to work for an
 
03:37:08.750 --> 03:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
agency that had
 
03:37:11.090 --> 03:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
OSHA we had six inspectors for the state
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
of Montana literally on the road 24 7
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
looking for uh to respond to problems
 
03:37:18.910 --> 03:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
Des has one person
 
03:37:21.410 --> 03:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
examining and inspecting the landfills
 
03:37:23.570 --> 03:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
recycling centers transfer stations in
 
03:37:24.889 --> 03:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
the state so no matter how good the
 
03:37:26.929 --> 03:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
rules are and they're not good uh
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money to enforce them
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
so I hate to say it that way but it's a
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's a softball question
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none no
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
no representative Bixby so
 
03:37:41.399 --> 03:37:43.070 align:start position:0%
no representative Bixby so
um

03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:45.650 --> 03:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that's come up right
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that uh sort of
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
emerging in terms of landfills uh is uh
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh pfas and leachate and I
 
03:37:58.849 --> 03:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
was wondering if um
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
that needs some further level of
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
protection than what a what might have
 
03:38:06.349 --> 03:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
been required in the past
 
03:38:08.330 --> 03:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
well sure it does and this is a terribly
 
03:38:10.370 --> 03:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
vexing problem because I have real
 
03:38:12.290 --> 03:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
Sympathy for the landfill industry their
 
03:38:14.210 --> 03:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
trade Association swanna put out a
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
letter to Congress a few months ago they
 
03:38:18.290 --> 03:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
are going to be asking for legislation
 
03:38:22.030 --> 03:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
that would give relief to landfills for
 
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
Downstream pfas contamination because it
 
03:38:27.190 --> 03:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
is ubiquitous it is something that we as
 
03:38:29.929 --> 03:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
consumers have asked for over many
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
decades but that doesn't change the fact
 
03:38:35.450 --> 03:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
that these landfills are Laden with
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
consumer products that contain pfas and
 
03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
yes we need we need much more stringent
 
03:38:42.050 --> 03:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
monitoring for those chemicals more
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
frequent but again the best solution is
 
03:38:48.830 --> 03:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
not to cite improperly so that we're
 
03:38:51.410 --> 03:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
having to deal with 13 days or three
 
03:38:55.070 --> 03:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
months or for 4.9 years of time to find
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
and fix
 
03:38:59.809 --> 03:38:59.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up so um you also mentioned
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
earlier that
 
03:39:01.439 --> 03:39:02.090 align:start position:0%
earlier that
um

03:39:02.090 --> 03:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
there is a uh the the amount of uh
 
03:39:10.130 --> 03:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
leachate that um is in landfills because
 
03:39:13.010 --> 03:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
of the rain water deposition Etc is
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
enormous and I'm wondering uh how is
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
that they must have some some method for
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
for removing it how is that removed and
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
what safeguards are there
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
for making sure it doesn't get out of
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
hand and what's the backup if it does if
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
it does spill or something
 
03:39:34.250 --> 03:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
well so it's two different issues one is
 
03:39:37.610 --> 03:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
underground uh failure uh now the the
 
03:39:40.130 --> 03:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
expected operation as you know is that
 
03:39:42.170 --> 03:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
is that leachate collects between the
 
03:39:44.090 --> 03:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
liners and it's constantly being pumped
 
03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
out and trucked uh you know sometimes
 
03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
many hundreds of miles to a place where
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
it can be treated that's the expected
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
operation and that will have to go on
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
for decades after the landfill is closed
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
because of the continuing production of
 
03:39:59.090 --> 03:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
leachate from the from the waste but as
 
03:40:00.769 --> 03:40:00.779 align:start position:0%
you say there are also surface spills
 
03:40:02.210 --> 03:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
like the one we had in Bethlehem last
 
03:40:04.729 --> 03:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
two years ago and then there are
 
03:40:06.769 --> 03:40:06.779 align:start position:0%
failures so the peer-reviewed literature
 
03:40:09.170 --> 03:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
I handed out on the one pager says that
 
03:40:10.510 --> 03:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
geosynthetic plastic liners crack they
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
crack upon installation and they crack
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the ground later and also the
 
03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
compacted clay layers that are often
 
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
trucked in from off-site crack so there
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be a a second level of
 
03:40:29.090 --> 03:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
monitoring much deeper than anybody has
 
03:40:32.570 --> 03:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
monitored before uh but again this is a
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
cons it's called a bathtub it's a
 
03:40:34.439 --> 03:40:35.450 align:start position:0%
cons it's called a bathtub it's a
constant

03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
constant
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
outflow which needs to be gathered and
 
03:40:40.370 --> 03:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
treated and there's I think there's no
 
03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
way to avoid that it's a question of
 
03:40:43.969 --> 03:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
where do you put them so that the the
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
material can be pumped off and treated
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
and not get in the environment thank you
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your money appreciate it
 
03:40:59.570 --> 03:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Nancy Morrison
 
03:41:15.410 --> 03:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:19.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.610 --> 03:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
good day I'm Nancy Morrison but I'm here
 
03:41:25.969 --> 03:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
today to read a statement from
 
03:41:28.729 --> 03:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
Haley Jones who took ill last night and
 
03:41:31.070 --> 03:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
is not able to be here today to give
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
testimony so I'm here to read it for her
 
03:41:37.610 --> 03:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
um do you have it written to hand out to
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the committee I do not I think you've
 
03:41:42.530 --> 03:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
written in my own illegible handwriting
 
03:41:44.990 --> 03:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
but I have shortened it
 
03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:46.979 align:start position:0%
um because of respect for your time
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
today thank you appreciate it yes so
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and esteemed
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
members of the House committee on
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture my name is
 
03:41:58.250 --> 03:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
Haley Jones
 
03:42:00.410 --> 03:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I am the Vermont and New Hampshire
 
03:42:03.229 --> 03:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
state director with slingshot where we
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
work alongside communities most impacted
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
by environmental threats to take aim at
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide and regionally we bring
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
Community groups together to advocate
 
03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
for broader change to make sure no
 
03:42:23.330 --> 03:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
Community has to suffer a same problem
 
03:42:23.340 --> 03:42:25.309 align:start position:0%
Community has to suffer a same problem
again

03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
I am here today along with Community
 
03:42:29.690 --> 03:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
leaders from across the state to testify
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 56 a bill that
 
03:42:35.570 --> 03:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
sets proven science-based landfill
 
03:42:38.349 --> 03:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
setbacks to protect our water bodies
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
Recreation areas and human health
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
many others will speak to the economic
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
and environmental benefits of this bill
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
so today my testimony will focus on
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
public health ramifications

we know as you've heard today that all
 
03:42:56.330 --> 03:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
landfills leak discharging leachate into
 
03:42:58.190 --> 03:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
the surrounding soils where this garbage
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
juice can travel with concerning speed
 
03:43:05.330 --> 03:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
when landfills are cited on porous or
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise unsuitable terrain the
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%

03:43:22.729 --> 03:43:22.739 align:start position:0%

serious developmental problems
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
so it's clear that we need to prevent
 
03:43:45.290 --> 03:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
their spread whenever possible
 
03:43:48.170 --> 03:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
instituting landfill setbacks based on

the five-year distance of travel
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
estimates is a simple science-based way
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
to minimize this potentially devastating
 
03:43:58.969 --> 03:43:58.979 align:start position:0%
landfill problem
 
03:44:00.769 --> 03:44:00.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has learned the hard way
 
03:44:04.610 --> 03:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
with pfas and other industry toxins that
 
03:44:07.010 --> 03:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
the best approach to prevent harmful
 
03:44:11.929 --> 03:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
pollution is to act before it happens
 
03:44:14.330 --> 03:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
passing Common Sense legislation like

House Bill 56 while funding waste
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
reduction programs and decentralizing
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:45:39.710 --> 03:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
circling around uh there's there's two
 
03:45:42.290 --> 03:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
pieces of testimony I'm giving to you
 
03:45:45.170 --> 03:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
one of them is from a licensed
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist by the name of Muriel
 
03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:48.950 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist by the name of Muriel
Robinette

03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
Robinette
 
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
Muriel couldn't be here today but she
 
03:45:54.650 --> 03:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
has testified in the past on similar
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
bills she is an independent
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist with over 40 years of
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
experience in New Hampshire and has also
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
spent significant amount of time in
 
03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:03.830 align:start position:0%
spent significant amount of time in
Maine

03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
03:46:05.570 --> 03:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I share this with you because there
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
are differences of the opinion that you
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
heard facts earlier today Muriel
 
03:46:14.150 --> 03:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
strongly suggests uh supports this bill
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
and the key elements that uh would
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
described here a few minutes earlier so
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak to this but I
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to see I wanted you to have her
 
03:46:25.370 --> 03:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
testimony and Muriel would certainly be
 
03:46:29.570 --> 03:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
available for any follow-up later
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
I would also start by saying you've
 
03:46:34.370 --> 03:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
heard a lot today about remediation
 
03:46:36.050 --> 03:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a really important
 
03:46:36.060 --> 03:46:37.130 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a really important
point

03:46:37.130 --> 03:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:46:40.130 --> 03:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
but a lot of what house bill 56 is all
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
about is really prevention and
 
03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:44.690 align:start position:0%
about is really prevention and
protection

03:46:44.690 --> 03:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to spend a little bit of my
 
03:46:49.370 --> 03:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
time talking about both of those items
 
03:46:50.929 --> 03:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
so for the record my name is Wayne
 
03:46:53.090 --> 03:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
Morrison and I serve as president of
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
North Country Alliance for balance
 
03:46:58.729 --> 03:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
change if you haven't heard of ncabc we
 
03:47:01.370 --> 03:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
are a collection of local residents who
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
have banded together
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the expressed Focus to try and
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
promote both environmental and economic
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh best interests of New Hampshire's
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
North Country
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
over the past few years ncabc has been
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
very active in promoting legislation
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
would that would assist the Department
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services in updating
 
03:47:24.410 --> 03:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
its citing regulations for new Solid
 
03:47:26.450 --> 03:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
Waste landfill facilities
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
We Believe
 
03:47:32.330 --> 03:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
just as Vermont Maine Massachusetts and
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
other New England states have done
 
03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
that our current arbitrary one-size-fits
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
all 200 foot setback regulation is
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
inadequate unprotective and in fact
 
03:47:43.380 --> 03:47:44.929 align:start position:0%
inadequate unprotective and in fact
dangerous

03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire enacted the current
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
200-foot setback requirement between
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
landfills and perennial bodies of water
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
over 30 years ago
 
03:47:57.170 --> 03:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
a lot has changed since 1991.
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
yet despite advances in technology and
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
science and our growing understanding of
 
03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
the increased health safety and
 
03:48:07.729 --> 03:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
environmental risks involved our setback
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
criteria for citing new landfills has
 
03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
remained unchanged
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
in 1991 no one knew about the dangers of
 
03:48:19.250 --> 03:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
pfas and many other toxic chemicals now
 
03:48:23.150 --> 03:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
found in landfill leech leachate but
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
today we do
 
03:48:28.370 --> 03:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
we can't go back in time but we can take
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
decisive action now to protect New
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's future
 
03:48:36.110 --> 03:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
now in fact is the perfect time to get
 
03:48:37.490 --> 03:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
this right
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
there are currently no applications for
 
03:48:41.809 --> 03:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
new landfill developments sitting before
 
03:48:41.819 --> 03:48:43.429 align:start position:0%
new landfill developments sitting before
Des

03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
Des
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the solid waste biennial report
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
published in November of 2022 concludes
 
03:48:51.050 --> 03:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
that there is sufficient landfill
 
03:48:55.010 --> 03:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
capacity through at least 2034 and in
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
all likelihood well beyond
 
03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 56 ensures that the next new
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
landfill development in New Hampshire
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
whenever that becomes necessary will be
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
cited safely and with the best science
 
03:49:10.490 --> 03:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
information and Technology we now have
 
03:49:10.500 --> 03:49:11.990 align:start position:0%
information and Technology we now have
available

03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 56 ensures site-specific
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
criteria and requires no testing that
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
applicants don't already do
 
03:49:22.729 --> 03:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't ban new landfills
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't restrict how many landfills we
 
03:49:27.050 --> 03:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
ultimately have
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
it provides language making it crystal
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
clear that it doesn't apply to existing
 
03:49:33.530 --> 03:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
landfills or expansions of existing
 
03:49:33.540 --> 03:49:34.969 align:start position:0%
landfills or expansions of existing
landfills

03:49:34.969 --> 03:49:34.979 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 56 provides the state of New
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the opportunity to ensure
 
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
the sighting of new landfills is
 
03:49:43.610 --> 03:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
science-based and provides real
 
03:49:46.130 --> 03:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
protection for some of the most valuable
 
03:49:49.610 --> 03:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
and irreplaceable resources we have
 
03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
we don't need additional studies and
 
03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
commissions to know what we have to do
 
03:49:57.650 --> 03:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
all we need to do is look around to our
 
03:50:00.650 --> 03:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
neighboring states to realize that what
 
03:50:04.370 --> 03:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
we currently have is woefully inadequate
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
let us not forget that despite the
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
latest technology available and the best
 
03:50:13.090 --> 03:50:13.100 align:start position:0%
intentioned landfill operators
 
03:50:17.570 --> 03:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
accidents occur leachate spills
 
03:50:20.090 --> 03:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
people make mistakes
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
switches and valves fail doubled line
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
materials deteriorate and leaks
 
03:50:28.490 --> 03:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
inevitably happen
 
03:50:31.490 --> 03:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
when they do the only thing protecting
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
our rivers lakes wetlands and drinking
 
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
water supplies from a landfill's toxic
 
03:50:40.250 --> 03:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
leachate chemicals is the setback
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
distance regulation you have before you
 
03:50:42.359 --> 03:50:44.090 align:start position:0%
distance regulation you have before you
today

03:50:44.090 --> 03:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
the next new landfill will have
 
03:50:48.650 --> 03:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
generational impacts on our state and
 
03:50:50.090 --> 03:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
and we owe it to the people of New
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure we get it right
 
03:50:58.150 --> 03:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
I asked this committee to act now and
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically support house bill 56.
 
03:51:05.150 --> 03:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what is going to happen
 
03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and which bill is going to
 
03:51:07.260 --> 03:51:08.269 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and which bill is going to
pass

03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
I do know that before you today
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
is is an act that we can take that will
 
03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
significantly improve the protections
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
that our current regulations don't
 
03:51:18.540 --> 03:51:19.849 align:start position:0%
that our current regulations don't
provide

03:51:19.849 --> 03:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:51:23.450 --> 03:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
I applaud des and the effort to go and
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
study this subject in more detail I
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
encourage them to take whatever time is
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to get it right
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
but we know today that 200 feet is
 
03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
miserably inadequate and we should fix
 
03:51:37.370 --> 03:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
that now while other work goes on there
 
03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
is no reason not to go forward with this
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
house bill 56 it will immediately make
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's environments safer and I
 
03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
ask for your support thank you thank you

yes so uh We've we've heard
 
03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
um a lot of Health perspectives and
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
environmental perspectives what uh is
 
03:53:16.010 --> 03:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
your particular business perspective on
 
03:53:18.410 --> 03:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
this being a good bill or these these
 
03:53:21.530 --> 03:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
bills being good again we're a major in
 
03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh clean energy but also clean air and
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
clean water and I feel that this is a
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
very important bill for any waterway in
 
03:53:32.450 --> 03:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire again to build within 200
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%

good afternoon and welcome good
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh Madam chair and members of
 
03:53:56.450 --> 03:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
Henry vayu and I'm here on behalf of
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
Waste Management
 
03:54:03.290 --> 03:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
Waste Management owns and operates the
 
03:54:08.170 --> 03:54:08.180 align:start position:0%
turkey landfill in Rochester in the past
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
we've had this committee to the landfill
 
03:54:14.690 --> 03:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
for a tour we'd be happy to do something
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
similar at your leisure in your schedule
 
03:54:21.410 --> 03:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
as it permits uh but um I'm just here to
 
03:54:25.370 --> 03:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
address the issue of uh this bill in
 
03:54:29.110 --> 03:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
this issue and uh whether it applies to
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
expansions of landfills
 
03:54:36.010 --> 03:54:36.020 align:start position:0%
in last year's Bill
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
there was some language that I think the
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors intended
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
to exempt
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
and not have the bill applied to
 
03:54:50.330 --> 03:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
expansions of landfills but the way it
 
03:54:52.570 --> 03:54:52.580 align:start position:0%
was worded and the terms that it used
 
03:54:56.410 --> 03:54:56.420 align:start position:0%
and the words in the existing
 
03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
Des rules
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
made it somewhat ambiguous and so we at
 
03:55:07.490 --> 03:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
the end of the session last year had
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
urged the governor to veto the bill for
 
03:55:11.809 --> 03:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
03:55:11.819 --> 03:55:12.650 align:start position:0%
that reason
um

03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:15.530 --> 03:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
I have seen uh
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
language that I think went into the
 
03:55:20.889 --> 03:55:20.899 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
for the amendment that I believe that is
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
before you I don't have the amendment
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
before me uh but I have a copy of the
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me
 
03:55:31.199 --> 03:55:32.870 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me
oh

03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
they're all gone but it says there is a
 
03:55:37.490 --> 03:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph here that says nothing in this
 
03:55:39.889 --> 03:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall be construed to prohibit
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
the expansion or modification of any
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
landfill facilities on any site on which
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
as of December 1st 2022
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
a r c r a subtitle D landfill exists
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
that has been fully permitted and that
 
03:55:56.150 --> 03:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
is actively accepting waste
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I believe
 
03:55:58.560 --> 03:55:59.450 align:start position:0%
so I believe
um

03:55:59.450 --> 03:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Murray that this does not
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
nice you know it's it's fine I'm I'm
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
just directing the question to you
 
03:56:18.530 --> 03:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what the amendment is okay
 
03:56:21.050 --> 03:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that and I I
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
would just state that uh we would feel
 
03:56:26.929 --> 03:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
this clarifies it a lot better uh than
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
last year's language and uh we'd feel
 
03:56:32.570 --> 03:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
more comfortable uh with the language
 
03:56:35.330 --> 03:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
that is provided in the amendment thank
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
you it makes it clear that it wouldn't
 
03:56:40.090 --> 03:56:40.100 align:start position:0%
apply to expansions of
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
landfills okay thank you any other
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
testimony you'd like to give that is it
 
03:56:46.260 --> 03:56:47.750 align:start position:0%
testimony you'd like to give that is it
okay

03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee any
 
03:56:48.960 --> 03:56:50.769 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee any
questions

03:56:50.769 --> 03:56:50.779 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:56:53.630 --> 03:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
03:56:53.640 --> 03:56:54.710 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
so

03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
um as as uh
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
as a business as someone in the waste
 
03:57:02.090 --> 03:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
management business or representing some
 
03:57:04.010 --> 03:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
03:57:07.010 --> 03:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
do you feel that it makes sense to have
 
03:57:11.330 --> 03:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
substantial setbacks between uh newly
 
03:57:14.269 --> 03:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
created landfills and uh surface water
 
03:57:14.279 --> 03:57:16.729 align:start position:0%
created landfills and uh surface water
bodies

03:57:16.729 --> 03:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
03:57:19.370 --> 03:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
um so our landfill has been in operation
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
03:57:21.120 --> 03:57:21.710 align:start position:0%
for decades
um

03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:26.210 --> 03:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
it has as uh director whimsat described
 
03:57:28.610 --> 03:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
a very
 
03:57:28.620 --> 03:57:29.630 align:start position:0%
a very
um

03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:31.849 --> 03:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
we think adequate monitoring system
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
around it's it's a Line Landfill state
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the art landfill it has uh the
 
03:57:41.769 --> 03:57:41.779 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells uh to we think
 
03:57:44.570 --> 03:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
determine whether there needs to be any
 
03:57:48.889 --> 03:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
action taken there has never been uh any
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
issue that has caused alarm
 
03:57:52.199 --> 03:57:52.849 align:start position:0%
issue that has caused alarm
um

03:57:52.849 --> 03:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
so we think
 
03:57:57.290 --> 03:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
you know we're operating under what is
 
03:57:57.300 --> 03:57:58.550 align:start position:0%
you know we're operating under what is
sufficient

03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
um you're asking about
 
03:58:01.319 --> 03:58:02.030 align:start position:0%
um you're asking about
um

03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:04.729 --> 03:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
you know permitting of new landfills and
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
do we need
 
03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:07.969 align:start position:0%
do we need
um

03:58:07.969 --> 03:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:10.809 --> 03:58:10.819 align:start position:0%
different rules going forward
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not prepared to address that whole
 
03:58:16.370 --> 03:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
issue today
 
03:58:16.380 --> 03:58:17.750 align:start position:0%
issue today
um I

03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:58:20.889 --> 03:58:20.899 align:start position:0%
I don't have the technical expertise to
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to get on the record
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
that as far as you know the concern that
 
03:58:29.450 --> 03:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
we had last year about the ambiguity
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
with regards to the language on the
 
03:58:35.090 --> 03:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
expansions that this seems to make it
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
much clearer that's all follow-up so um
 
03:58:43.070 --> 03:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
I've read somewhere that uh that your
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
that waste management is doing
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment of leachate for pfas
 
03:58:51.650 --> 03:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
before it leaves the site is that
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
something that you think should be more
 
03:58:56.570 --> 03:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
commonly done
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to have someone come in
 
03:59:00.410 --> 03:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
to talk to the committee about it again
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
um okay not not not in your pay grade
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
not on my pages all right thank you
 
03:59:09.530 --> 03:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you um I have a question as to uh
 
03:59:12.769 --> 03:59:12.779 align:start position:0%
are there any specific materials that
 
03:59:15.530 --> 03:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
you turn away from your landfill that
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
you won't accept well there there's a
 
03:59:21.590 --> 03:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
list of materials uh in the statute that
 
03:59:23.929 --> 03:59:23.939 align:start position:0%
are banned yard waste
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know hazardous materials
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so the statute does provide some
 
03:59:33.250 --> 03:59:33.260 align:start position:0%
direction of what can it you know uh
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
certain batteries
 
03:59:35.760 --> 03:59:37.309 align:start position:0%
certain batteries
um

03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:39.410 --> 03:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
you know there are things are numerated
 
03:59:41.389 --> 03:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
03:59:41.399 --> 03:59:43.429 align:start position:0%
in the statute
um

03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:43.439 --> 03:59:46.309 align:start position:0%
um
okay

03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.969 --> 03:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh representative Howard
 
03:59:51.769 --> 03:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:59:54.170 --> 03:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm a little bit curious about
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
how far what is the furthest distance
 
03:59:59.210 --> 03:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
that the garbage trucks come from to to
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
put um waste in your landfill
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's a regional Solid
 
04:00:08.570 --> 04:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
Waste Market
 
04:00:10.849 --> 04:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
um there obviously is some out-of-state
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
waste that comes in
 
04:00:12.720 --> 04:00:14.450 align:start position:0%
waste that comes in
um

04:00:14.450 --> 04:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know from exactly how far you
 
04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
know the fire this point that uh one
 
04:00:21.650 --> 04:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
comes but
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
um you know it's something that uh uh
 
04:00:26.570 --> 04:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
communities all over have to take into
 
04:00:28.250 --> 04:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
consideration in terms of the cost that
 
04:00:30.889 --> 04:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
usually comes down to the class and so
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
for uh some places far away it's the
 
04:00:36.910 --> 04:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
trucking cost and how much it costs to
 
04:00:41.150 --> 04:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
transport it uh the distance and what is
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
available in their state and what's the
 
04:00:47.510 --> 04:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
Tipping fee uh um in their state for
 
04:00:50.750 --> 04:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
their landfill sites so it does vary
 
04:00:50.760 --> 04:00:51.530 align:start position:0%
their landfill sites so it does vary
um

04:00:51.530 --> 04:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
how to know that answer your question
 
04:00:55.729 --> 04:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
but I asked quick follow-up follow-up
 
04:00:55.739 --> 04:00:56.570 align:start position:0%
but I asked quick follow-up follow-up
sure

04:00:56.570 --> 04:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:00:59.330 --> 04:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
um so the someone I started earlier that
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have adequate
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
um uh um landfill
 
04:01:06.410 --> 04:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
capacity now would you agree with that
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
so uh the turkey landfill has capacity
 
04:01:14.450 --> 04:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
until I think it's June of 2034.
 
04:01:18.050 --> 04:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
um now to get something permitted is not
 
04:01:20.689 --> 04:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
something overnight it takes a long time
 
04:01:23.210 --> 04:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
to get the application to get all the
 
04:01:25.630 --> 04:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
testing done to prove to the department
 
04:01:28.250 --> 04:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh that they should provide the permit
 
04:01:30.530 --> 04:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
so you need you obviously need some lead
 
04:01:30.540 --> 04:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
so you need you obviously need some lead
time

04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:01:36.290 --> 04:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
um Waste Management has more land that
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
they own that I'm sure at some point in
 
04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
time they're
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to be asking for a permit to
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
expand to those other areas so there is
 
04:01:48.359 --> 04:01:50.150 align:start position:0%
expand to those other areas so there is
potential

04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
potential
 
04:01:52.689 --> 04:01:52.699 align:start position:0%
um at the turkey landfill in Rochester
 
04:01:55.330 --> 04:01:55.340 align:start position:0%
to have it go beyond
 
04:01:57.290 --> 04:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
2034 but
 
04:02:01.010 --> 04:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
with if we didn't get another permit to
 
04:02:05.570 --> 04:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
expand uh we'd be shutting down uh June
 
04:02:09.170 --> 04:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
so um just to a little bit more clarity
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
on the permitting process is it is it
 
04:02:20.090 --> 04:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
correct that permits are typically
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
issued for something like 10 to 15 years
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
or maybe 20 years I don't remember the
 
04:02:29.450 --> 04:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
exact number and that and that there's a
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
constant process of renewal of the
 
04:02:33.050 --> 04:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
permit so you would not you would never
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
get a permit forever you'd have to you
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
have to renew those over a period of
 
04:02:40.670 --> 04:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
time and if you have the capacity it is
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
generally within the at least what we've
 
04:02:46.490 --> 04:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
seen previously without with your
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
landfill and other ones that those
 
04:02:50.210 --> 04:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
permits are granted if there's no
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
significant impediment I know uh the
 
04:02:56.090 --> 04:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
current uh permit that we have there's a
 
04:02:58.090 --> 04:02:58.100 align:start position:0%
depletion schedule
 
04:03:01.610 --> 04:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
so the company can't just fill it up in
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
year one or two there has we the cut
 
04:03:07.450 --> 04:03:07.460 align:start position:0%
we've committed to have that capacity
 
04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
till June of
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
2034 and so you have to keep careful uh
 
04:03:18.769 --> 04:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
attention to how quickly it's filling
 
04:03:21.710 --> 04:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
because there is a commitment in the
 
04:03:25.250 --> 04:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
permit to have the capacity for the
 
04:03:30.050 --> 04:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
state's needs until June of 2034. so I
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if that totally answers your
 
04:03:33.910 --> 04:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
question but it does address
 
04:03:36.769 --> 04:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
that there's a guarantee that there will
 
04:03:39.170 --> 04:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
be space there for the state's needs
 
04:03:39.180 --> 04:03:40.910 align:start position:0%
be space there for the state's needs
right

04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
but I I just wanted to be clear that
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
that's not the uh end date for
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
everything that's the end date for the
 
04:03:52.370 --> 04:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
current president for the Kermit it all
 
04:03:53.929 --> 04:03:53.939 align:start position:0%
things being equal it's likely that
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
you'd get another one
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative germano thank you madam
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:04:05.389 --> 04:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
so as I'm thinking about how New
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compares to some of the states
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
around us in terms of some of these
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
regulations one of the other things that
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
comes to my mind in terms of what makes
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
us different from some of the
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding states is we take uh items
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
right in our landfills that other states
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
have already banned from their landfills
 
04:04:26.689 --> 04:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
correct uh different states
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
have different
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
um laws with regards to what can go I
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
know in Vermont
 
04:04:37.610 --> 04:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
um for instance uh they uh ban uh food
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
waste over certain uh you know
 
04:04:41.090 --> 04:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative ebill's bill that she
 
04:04:44.090 --> 04:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
brought in is modeled after Vermont and
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah certainly there there are
 
04:04:50.450 --> 04:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
other states that ban things uh that go
 
04:04:53.330 --> 04:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
into landfills that uh the state of New
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hasn't done yet
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
a follow-up follow-up thank you madam
 
04:04:59.330 --> 04:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
chair and I believe there was a recent
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
article I forget where I read it about
 
04:05:03.290 --> 04:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
it for example we also take mattresses
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
correct which some other states will not
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
allow mattresses to be disposed of in
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
landfills and it would seem to me that
 
04:05:11.689 --> 04:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
that also introduces a problem uh
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why those states have
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
banned substances like mattresses from
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
being put in landfills and so how do we
 
04:05:22.370 --> 04:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
take into account the types of chemicals
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
for example uh that are in some of these
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
substances that are not allowed to be
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
put into landfills in other states but
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
that we do allow here in New Hampshire
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
so uh you know the the
 
04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
landfills today have to have uh the
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
collection system for the leachate
 
04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
um we pre-treat it
 
04:05:41.160 --> 04:05:42.769 align:start position:0%
um we pre-treat it
um so

04:05:42.769 --> 04:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:05:44.809 --> 04:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we tried to the best
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
04:05:48.550 --> 04:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
um address that issue uh but certainly
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh materials that uh go in uh do have
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
04:05:54.479 --> 04:05:56.809 align:start position:0%
some uh
uh

04:05:56.809 --> 04:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:59.210 --> 04:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
you know pfas and whatnot
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair any
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%

hearing my testimony I realize time is
 
04:06:37.370 --> 04:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
short so I will not read my whole
 
04:06:39.650 --> 04:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
written I will highlight some things for

04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
representing licensed Engineers I also
 
04:07:37.010 --> 04:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
represent the Council on the New
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Southwest working group I want
 
04:07:41.450 --> 04:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
to be clear that my testimony today is
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
based on my personal professional
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
experience as a landfill designer and
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
not for the council or the working group
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
these thoughts and opinions are not
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.410 --> 04:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
um HP 56 references
 
04:07:59.210 --> 04:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
um there were some comments about uh
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether this applies to expansions
 
04:08:05.809 --> 04:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
I suggest that's a question for Des the
 
04:08:07.849 --> 04:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
term new landfill in my experience with
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
Des is any new capacity that's in the
 
04:08:13.010 --> 04:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
state is how they view that so uh
 
04:08:15.410 --> 04:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
definitions for expansions need to be
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
um also like to point out that like
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
everyone else here I'm very concerned
 
04:08:23.410 --> 04:08:23.420 align:start position:0%
about the environment and how we humans
 
04:08:26.630 --> 04:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
affect our planet we all create waste
 
04:08:28.849 --> 04:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
and we contribute to the need for
 
04:08:32.330 --> 04:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
landfills in responsible disposal my
 
04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
career is focused on remediating
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
contaminated properties and developing
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
technically sound environment
 
04:08:40.010 --> 04:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
environmentally protective Sal waste
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
disposal facilities
 
04:08:43.130 --> 04:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we didn't need
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
landfills and I can focus my practice on
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning up dirty sites unfortunately
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
our modern society and standards for
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
living require us to have a final
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
repository for materials that can
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise be reused recycled or
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise managed so that landfills
 
04:09:00.650 --> 04:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
aren't needed until such time you live
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
in a truly a true Society of no ways
 
04:09:05.570 --> 04:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
that we will need landfills and these
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
facilities must be properly located
 
04:09:09.889 --> 04:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
designed constructed and operated so
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
future Generations don't have to clean
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
up after us
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and other states which
 
04:09:18.050 --> 04:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a licensed licensed professionals
 
04:09:20.210 --> 04:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
are bound by a code of ethics makes us
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
responsible to human health and the
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
environment we accomplished these goals
 
04:09:27.290 --> 04:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
of ethics and design by following rules
 
04:09:29.210 --> 04:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
and codes guidelines and Engineering
 
04:09:31.250 --> 04:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
judgment based on industry standard
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
scientific evaluations
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
Technologies and standards of practice
 
04:09:38.330 --> 04:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
since I've been in practice there have
 
04:09:39.769 --> 04:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
been countless Publications about
 
04:09:43.490 --> 04:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
landfills both Pro and pecan
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
um but the overwhelming consensus of
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
these technical studies is that properly
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
designed constructed in operated
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
landline landfills are protective of the
 
04:09:54.170 --> 04:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
environment independent of their
 
04:09:54.180 --> 04:09:55.309 align:start position:0%
environment independent of their
location

04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
location
 
04:09:57.110 --> 04:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to other statements you may
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
have heard excessive testing and
 
04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
research is documented that geosynthetic
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
components of line landfills can have
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
service lives of hundreds of years
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
as proposed HB 56 would override the
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
existing setback criteria with the
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
the time of travel
 
04:10:16.500 --> 04:10:17.530 align:start position:0%
the time of travel
um

04:10:17.530 --> 04:10:17.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
requirements are as we have heard are
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
exerted exerted from the state of Maine
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
Sal waste rules not law
 
04:10:28.729 --> 04:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
given the differences with other aspects
 
04:10:31.010 --> 04:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
of the main rules and their statutes it
 
04:10:33.170 --> 04:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
is not prudent to selectively cut and
 
04:10:35.929 --> 04:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
paste language from one State's rules
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire's legislation
 
04:10:42.530 --> 04:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
furthermore HP 56 would require the Des
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
to establish new definitions and
 
04:10:47.570 --> 04:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
procedures to evaluate the quote project
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement allowances unquote to reduce
 
04:10:52.610 --> 04:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
the potential travel times
 
04:10:54.650 --> 04:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
please understand that creating such a
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
statutory framework for landfill citing
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
establishes a one-size-fits-all
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
condition that eliminates the
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
application of good science and
 
04:11:04.849 --> 04:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
engineering in essence the requirements
 
04:11:07.610 --> 04:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
of HB 56 have not been evaluated as
 
04:11:09.650 --> 04:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
being appropriate for New Hampshire and
 
04:11:12.050 --> 04:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
do not consider the impact of existing
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
rules in other citing criteria and
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
therefore is unjust unjustifiably
 
04:11:17.520 --> 04:11:20.030 align:start position:0%
therefore is unjust unjustifiably
limiting

04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.040 --> 04:11:21.290 align:start position:0%
 
having

04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:11:21.300 --> 04:11:23.990 align:start position:0%
having
um

04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.210 --> 04:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
you've heard lots of testimony already I
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat it about the value
 
04:11:30.410 --> 04:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
of the five-year setback and the use of
 
04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
a maximum one-time value that on the
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
site that might not be applicable to
 
04:11:37.429 --> 04:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow or actually even the
 
04:11:40.010 --> 04:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
location of performance of the landfill
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want Insurance my written
 
04:11:43.130 --> 04:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't want a believer of
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
your time with that but basically using
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
the highest rate value to calculate a
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
travel time distance is is an excessive
 
04:11:53.809 --> 04:11:53.819 align:start position:0%
um method compared to our traditional
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
approach a risk analysis and factors of
 
04:11:56.160 --> 04:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
approach a risk analysis and factors of
safety

04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out that the
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
project proven allowances in Maine in
 
04:12:03.889 --> 04:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
their rules
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
um allow for items that the New
 
04:12:07.969 --> 04:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rules already have built into
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
our system for example Maine has a
 
04:12:12.349 --> 04:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
single line of requirement you can have
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
a double liner requirement to read as a
 
04:12:16.610 --> 04:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
project allowance we require in this
 
04:12:19.370 --> 04:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
state a double liner system so how we
 
04:12:21.170 --> 04:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
would actually go about reducing that
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
potential five-year is is not clear and
 
04:12:25.250 --> 04:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
unknown and puts a lot of burden on the
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
Des and I think we'll re will result in
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
potential primitive Peels and possible
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
litigation on permanent applications in
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
I feel that HP 56 takes a cherry picking
 
04:12:41.689 --> 04:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
approach to development of landfills it
 
04:12:43.490 --> 04:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
promotes an unrealistic approach to the
 
04:12:45.110 --> 04:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
practice of engineering
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates the design professionals
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
ability to reasonably apply
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
site-specific data industry standards
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines and Engineering judgment to
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
the siding and designing of
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
environmentally protective landfills
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
my professional opinion HP 56 will not
 
04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
improve the Environmental Protection of
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
blind landfills in New Hampshire rather
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
it will ensure that no new no new
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity will be permitted in
 
04:13:14.090 --> 04:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
the state which is not prudent for the
 
04:13:15.530 --> 04:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire's solid waste
 
04:13:17.330 --> 04:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
needs in the future
 
04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr steinheiser um
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
the question yes so um is it your
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
feeling that uh it would be impossible
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
to find a site in New Hampshire that
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:13:45.650 --> 04:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
um probably not however the resulting
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
site that might be available to develop
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
only if it might not be practical to
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
develop if you look at any of the the
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state they have and
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
you've talked about some of this already
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants on site they
 
04:14:01.490 --> 04:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
have lots of infrastructure around them
 
04:14:04.450 --> 04:14:04.460 align:start position:0%
to handle landfill gas and in other
 
04:14:07.610 --> 04:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
components to run a well operated
 
04:14:10.969 --> 04:14:10.979 align:start position:0%
landfill so to have that capital
 
04:14:12.889 --> 04:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
expenditure for all those incendiary
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
facilities that have a very small
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity it would not work it
 
04:14:19.130 --> 04:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
would not pencil out to develop a
 
04:14:20.330 --> 04:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
landfill there
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:24.290 --> 04:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative coulon
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:14:27.889 --> 04:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:14:30.650 --> 04:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious in your opinion what
 
04:14:31.610 --> 04:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh good language to let a community
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
um you know potential landfill citing in
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I think the rules and the procedures
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
that Des has for public input in public
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
need already built into the permitting
 
04:14:56.030 --> 04:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
process there was a discussion about the
 
04:14:58.849 --> 04:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
permitting process a landfill needs to
 
04:15:02.210 --> 04:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
provide only enough capacity as the
 
04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
state has need within a I believe a
 
04:15:05.769 --> 04:15:05.779 align:start position:0%
20-year period
 
04:15:08.150 --> 04:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
does it mean it solves all the needs for
 
04:15:10.610 --> 04:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
that 20-year period but it has to show a
 
04:15:12.530 --> 04:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
public need and there's when any new
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity in the state it's
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
required to have a public hearing
 
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's public comments to the
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
applications and there's a appeal
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
processes as well so I believe the
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
community has and has
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
been able to respond to those issues
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.610 --> 04:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:15:34.620 --> 04:15:36.410 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Creighton

04:15:36.410 --> 04:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
Creighton
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir thank you for your testimony
 
04:15:40.130 --> 04:15:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
and you've said it but I just how would
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
you respond to testimony
 
04:15:47.450 --> 04:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
that we've heard this afternoon that
 
04:15:49.729 --> 04:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
says that this is
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
um scientific and
 
04:15:54.650 --> 04:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
accepted practice yeah I know you said
 
04:15:57.290 --> 04:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
in your testimony but I just
 
04:15:59.570 --> 04:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand exactly you
 
04:16:01.130 --> 04:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
know we've heard numerous testimonies
 
04:16:03.410 --> 04:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
that this is scientific that it is
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
accepted practice that it is acceptable
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have other testimonies
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
saying the opposite so how would you
 
04:16:12.410 --> 04:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
respond to that thank you for your
 
04:16:12.420 --> 04:16:13.729 align:start position:0%
respond to that thank you for your
question

04:16:13.729 --> 04:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:13.739 --> 04:16:14.330 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:16:14.330 --> 04:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:16.370 --> 04:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
technical terms in math does not make
 
04:16:18.769 --> 04:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
something scientific
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
um the approach to citing a landfill in
 
04:16:24.530 --> 04:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
the design behind it goes through a lot
 
04:16:26.330 --> 04:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
of evaluation
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of scrutiny by the Des
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's a years-long process to to go
 
04:16:35.809 --> 04:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:39.050 --> 04:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
what Maine has proposed as as their
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
criteria has a number of caveats to it
 
04:16:44.809 --> 04:16:44.819 align:start position:0%
allowances to reduce maybe to zero that
 
04:16:46.610 --> 04:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
setback criteria
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
so just pulling their rules without
 
04:16:52.330 --> 04:16:52.340 align:start position:0%
definition of how allowances are made
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
incomplete at best
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and as I've said the and as you can
 
04:17:02.929 --> 04:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
see in our rules we already have many of
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
those allowances built into requirements
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we have now for our landfills so
 
04:17:10.610 --> 04:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what else we would have to
 
04:17:10.620 --> 04:17:12.290 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what else we would have to
do

04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:17:14.570 --> 04:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
or what Des would have to come up with
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
to allow for additional
 
04:17:17.160 --> 04:17:17.809 align:start position:0%
to allow for additional
um

04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:20.689 --> 04:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
approaches and evaluations to to allow
 
04:17:23.090 --> 04:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
for allowances
 
04:17:24.830 --> 04:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony representative
 
04:17:24.840 --> 04:17:26.269 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony representative
germano

04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
germano
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony for taking my question I'm
 
04:17:31.370 --> 04:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
going to piggyback on representative
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
Creighton's question about the science
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
and of course the the word scientists I
 
04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
think hate the most is arbitrary uh and
 
04:17:40.490 --> 04:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is which is more
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrary a foot measurement 200 feet or
 
04:17:49.969 --> 04:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
a measurement of the velocity of a
 
04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
seepage it would seem to me that a a 200
 
04:17:52.979 --> 04:17:54.170 align:start position:0%
seepage it would seem to me that a a 200
foot

04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
foot
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
um distance is is a much more arbitrary
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
measure than the speed at which one
 
04:18:06.110 --> 04:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
the water moves thank you to your
 
04:18:06.120 --> 04:18:06.889 align:start position:0%
the water moves thank you to your
question

04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
um sometimes I qualify my answers when
 
04:18:10.610 --> 04:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
you ask an engineer a question that
 
04:18:13.370 --> 04:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
they'll answer with it depends so it
 
04:18:13.380 --> 04:18:14.750 align:start position:0%
they'll answer with it depends so it
depends

04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
depends
 
04:18:16.729 --> 04:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
um both measurements are not arbitrary
 
04:18:19.250 --> 04:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
they're set measurements
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it's what you're going to use that
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
measurement for I don't know the basis
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
of the 200 foot setback for
 
04:18:28.250 --> 04:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
um the landfill Edge to the the Waterway
 
04:18:28.260 --> 04:18:28.969 align:start position:0%
um the landfill Edge to the the Waterway
um

04:18:28.969 --> 04:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
the measurement of seepage velocity I'm
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
not a hydrogeologist so I don't do that
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
measurement I'm not quite sure how you
 
04:18:37.610 --> 04:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
do that so the actual methodology and
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
calculation of that could have some
 
04:18:41.040 --> 04:18:41.630 align:start position:0%
calculation of that could have some
um

04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
let's say disagreement scientifically I
 
04:18:45.530 --> 04:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't know how you would do that
 
04:18:45.540 --> 04:18:47.269 align:start position:0%
don't know how you would do that
personally

04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
personally
 
04:18:47.279 --> 04:18:49.370 align:start position:0%
personally
um so

04:18:49.370 --> 04:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
the arbitrary comment would be you just
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
pick a number and apply it so I would
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
say both could be arbitrary because
 
04:19:00.170 --> 04:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
you're picking a value that is ultra
 
04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
conservative might and I have in my
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony it might be an outlier
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
value and applying it just as you would
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
apply the 200 feet
 
04:19:10.250 --> 04:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
you might get the same answer
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
um but you might not so which approach
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
you take either one could be arbitrary I
 
04:19:17.809 --> 04:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
think the the comments about fully
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
understanding the site and how it works
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hydrogeologically topography
 
04:19:22.859 --> 04:19:23.929 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hydrogeologically topography
like

04:19:23.929 --> 04:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:19:26.330 --> 04:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
um and and what else you can do for that
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
site to make the system the landfill
 
04:19:31.370 --> 04:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
work is not an arbitrary procedure
 
04:19:33.010 --> 04:19:33.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you madam chair
 
04:19:37.250 --> 04:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:19:42.889 --> 04:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh just piggybacking on all of this
 
04:19:42.899 --> 04:19:44.689 align:start position:0%
uh just piggybacking on all of this
arbitrary

04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
arbitrary
 
04:19:47.030 --> 04:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
um The Five-Year setback uh travel
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
setback is exactly that a five-year
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
travel setback but the minimum but the
 
04:19:56.030 --> 04:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback is only a minimum so
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
that can be adjusted so that really is
 
04:20:00.889 --> 04:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
cannot be considered in my opinion would
 
04:20:02.570 --> 04:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
you consider that arbitrary because it's
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.929 --> 04:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I'm not sure
 
04:20:10.490 --> 04:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
how to answer that
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
um there are lots of criteria in the
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
solid waste rules
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's only a page and a half but
 
04:20:16.849 --> 04:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of criteria we have to
 
04:20:16.859 --> 04:20:17.689 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of criteria we have to
follow

04:20:17.689 --> 04:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
when you add on all the criteria and you
 
04:20:22.849 --> 04:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
start laying out what um the ultimate
 
04:20:25.010 --> 04:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
limits of a landfill development could
 
04:20:25.020 --> 04:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
limits of a landfill development could
be

04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
um it becomes less arbitrary because
 
04:20:32.150 --> 04:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're compounding uh criteria so
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes they are minimums
 
04:20:34.560 --> 04:20:35.330 align:start position:0%
uh yes they are minimums
um

04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
but depending on how the site looks and
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
how you want to operate it those
 
04:20:41.210 --> 04:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
minimums are minimums and that's where
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
you start and then you develop from
 
04:20:43.020 --> 04:20:44.229 align:start position:0%
you start and then you develop from
there

04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:20:48.110 --> 04:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes so um in Maine
 
04:20:50.090 --> 04:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure whether it's just in
 
04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
statute or rules but uh they do not
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
allow any landfill citing on highly
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
porous soil do you think that makes
 
04:20:57.479 --> 04:20:59.450 align:start position:0%
porous soil do you think that makes
sense

04:20:59.450 --> 04:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question that makes
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
sense for Maine
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
um they defined those geologic types
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
very specifically
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
um again I'm not the higher geologist so
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'd rather not comment on what those
 
04:21:13.969 --> 04:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
definitions are but they are very
 
04:21:16.250 --> 04:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
specific to very specific areas as I
 
04:21:22.130 --> 04:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative Darcy
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
um and this question is just to help me
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
put this in context
 
04:21:31.800 --> 04:21:32.389 align:start position:0%
put this in context
um

04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm on a Conservation Commission and and
 
04:21:37.130 --> 04:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
so we've worked with Sanborn head in the
 
04:21:39.889 --> 04:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
past uh so my question to you is to
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
Sanborn and head have any contracts with
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Des or have you ever
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
worked for New Hampshire Des thank you
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
for your question I have it in my
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that we are a consultant to
 
04:21:50.520 --> 04:21:51.670 align:start position:0%
testimony that we are a consultant to
Des

04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
Des
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
as well as a DOT
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
04:21:57.840 --> 04:22:00.050 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
no seeing none
 
04:22:05.929 --> 04:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
I do not have any more pink cards for
 
04:22:05.939 --> 04:22:07.250 align:start position:0%
I do not have any more pink cards for
um

04:22:07.250 --> 04:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
um

04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Preston for
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
recognizing me I asked to speak on the
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
second bill but I'm not going to speak
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
on that bill I'll take my two cents
 
04:22:43.490 --> 04:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
worth right now and take my chances
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
my name is Clark horse and I'm uh
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
affiliated with collaborative solo waste
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
strategies a new New Hampshire
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
non-profit which hopes to serve as a
 
04:22:56.090 --> 04:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
catalyst for different ways of looking
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
at landfills and incineration in our
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
state please speak into the microphone
 
04:23:02.990 --> 04:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
so that the folks at home can hear thank
 
04:23:06.370 --> 04:23:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.070 --> 04:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
unlike the scientists and the engineers
 
04:23:12.429 --> 04:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
and the doctors and
 
04:23:15.530 --> 04:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
experts that previously testified this
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
afternoon I never went to Harvard but I
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
can assure you a lot of habits gone
 
04:23:21.170 --> 04:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
through me
 
04:23:24.650 --> 04:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
I was a lobbyist in this in this state
 
04:23:26.570 --> 04:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
for 42 years
 
04:23:29.330 --> 04:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
and was
 
04:23:31.370 --> 04:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
probably principally responsible for
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
killing over 68 bottle bills
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
but times have changed that was 1971.
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's when I started
 
04:23:42.769 --> 04:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
this building was a post office at that
 
04:23:42.779 --> 04:23:45.769 align:start position:0%
this building was a post office at that

04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
the first five speakers today all
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned the words remedial we can do
 
04:23:53.929 --> 04:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
this we can take care of this if if if
 
04:23:56.809 --> 04:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
we have a problem we have Solutions in
 
04:23:59.929 --> 04:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
place where we have remedial actions I
 
04:24:01.490 --> 04:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
why don't we take a preventive action by
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
passing these bills today or some
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
combination that you deem necessary
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to waiting for the Senate
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
why wait for the Senate all revenue
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
raising bills in this General Court have
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
to originate in the lower body
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
in my estimation you're not the lower
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
body you're the you're the
 
04:24:27.469 --> 04:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
you're the big body
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
and this committee is critically
 
04:24:32.809 --> 04:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
important to the future of our state and
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
your grandchildren and my great great
 
04:24:36.650 --> 04:24:36.660 align:start position:0%

04:24:42.410 --> 04:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
old enough to be most of our grandfather
 
04:24:46.130 --> 04:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
to most of you is what I intended to say
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
200 feet
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
is about how far I hit the ball off of
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
the ladies tee at Nashua Country Club
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
the distance from a pitcher's mound the
 
04:25:01.150 --> 04:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
distance from home plate to second base
 
04:25:04.189 --> 04:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
and back the home plate is about 200
 
04:25:04.199 --> 04:25:05.870 align:start position:0%
and back the home plate is about 200
feet

04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
feet
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
would you want your grandchildren
 
04:25:10.729 --> 04:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
playing in a playground within 200 feet
 
04:25:14.150 --> 04:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:14.160 --> 04:25:16.189 align:start position:0%

04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
I ask you to consider Common Sense today
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
these bills are critically important Des
 
04:25:32.689 --> 04:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
is hamstrung
 
04:25:35.450 --> 04:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
they can only do what they're told to do
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
they can only do with the staff that
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
they have to do with
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that there's one
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
on-site landfill person that handles the
 
04:25:50.570 --> 04:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
does that give you a feeling of comfort
 
04:26:00.889 --> 04:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
I'll testify I'll conclude my testimony
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
now I just ask you
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
to ask yourselves
 
04:26:09.290 --> 04:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
what's at stake
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
for the future of our state I wish to
 
04:26:18.769 --> 04:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.410 --> 04:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
it would make me feel a lot better and
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
those that follow me
 
04:26:26.210 --> 04:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Corson uh I just wanted to
 
04:26:33.469 --> 04:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh verify you had said that you put in a
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
pink card for the next bill I did and
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to leave the building
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
for the sake of my safety after my
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
testimony so I won't be testified I'm
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
sure you'll be safe sir I would just I
 
04:26:48.410 --> 04:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
would just say one more thing if I could
 
04:26:50.570 --> 04:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
my good friend Henry vayu represents
 
04:26:52.370 --> 04:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
Waste Management
 
04:26:55.729 --> 04:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
I think waste management is compared to
 
04:26:58.210 --> 04:26:58.220 align:start position:0%
the other private
 
04:27:01.610 --> 04:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
landfill operator in this state heads
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
and shoulders
 
04:27:05.929 --> 04:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
above the one that's trying to ruin the
 
04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
the section that you call Dalton on the
 
04:27:08.340 --> 04:27:10.610 align:start position:0%
the section that you call Dalton on the
river

04:27:10.610 --> 04:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
but he said he had an amendment prepared
 
04:27:16.250 --> 04:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
or an amendment had been prepared which
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
Waste Management felt much more
 
04:27:19.969 --> 04:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
I would hope that he had said we
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
strongly Advocate the passage of some
 
04:27:29.090 --> 04:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
combination of 50
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
6 and 602 today and take a more
 
04:27:36.490 --> 04:27:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
with that said I'll conclude my
 
04:27:40.250 --> 04:27:40.260 align:start position:0%

Grafton district one Littleton Lisbon
 
04:37:51.890 --> 04:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
Lyman Sugar Hill bath and Monroe I am
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce you hb602 and as
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
I often sit in the seat that you are in
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
I recognize how difficult it is to hear
 
04:38:01.849 --> 04:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
two bills like this in one right after
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
the other but what I do have for you
 
04:38:05.810 --> 04:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
today and now I understand the reason
 
04:38:08.209 --> 04:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
for it coming to my attention is Maine
 
04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
statute so we've heard a lot today about
 
04:38:12.830 --> 04:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
Maine statute the specifics of Maine
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
statute comparisons to Maine statute and
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
that is much more specifically fleshed
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
out in hb602 so I would just like to
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
walk you through a couple of pieces of
 
04:38:24.769 --> 04:38:24.779 align:start position:0%
that I'm then happy to take any
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
questions that I am
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
capable of answering if you turn to page
 
04:38:29.279 --> 04:38:31.609 align:start position:0%

04:38:31.609 --> 04:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.619 --> 04:38:32.631 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:38:32.631 --> 04:38:32.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
the first through line 10 really deals
 
04:38:37.369 --> 04:38:37.379 align:start position:0%
with some differences between this bill
 
04:38:39.890 --> 04:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
and the last bill as far as the soil
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
composition specifically under where the
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
waste is going to be is going to
 
04:38:46.250 --> 04:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
accumulate and as one of the previous
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
speakers towards the end said Maine does
 
04:38:50.929 --> 04:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
have stringent requirements as far as
 
04:38:53.470 --> 04:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
the soil composition directly underneath
 
04:38:56.330 --> 04:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
the landfill itself and if you look at
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
line seven number three it says the area
 
04:39:01.131 --> 04:39:01.141 align:start position:0%
within the solid waste boundary shall be
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
located on soils with sufficient fine
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
and clay-sized particles to minimize
 
04:39:06.529 --> 04:39:06.539 align:start position:0%
leachate infiltration every measurement
 
04:39:08.631 --> 04:39:08.641 align:start position:0%
made and into two soils within the
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
property shall have an undisturbed
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity less than or
 
04:39:14.631 --> 04:39:14.641 align:start position:0%
equal to one times 10-5 centimeters per
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
second my understanding of this and
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
talking with people in Maine is that
 
04:39:21.650 --> 04:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
that measurement basically indicates
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
that if the hydraulic conductivity of
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
that level of soil is in place or less
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
than it would take about uh stuff would
 
04:39:32.631 --> 04:39:32.641 align:start position:0%
travel about 10 feet per year so if you
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a thousand foot setback it would
 
04:39:36.051 --> 04:39:36.061 align:start position:0%
take 100 years for that
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
um to try stuff to travel that far
 
04:39:41.150 --> 04:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
um it was believed at the time that at
 
04:39:42.770 --> 04:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
least at the last hearing that Maine had
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
on this issue uh to kind of review these
 
04:39:47.208 --> 04:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
policies that
 
04:39:50.630 --> 04:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
landfills are in use and are at a higher
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
level of leaking for about a hundred
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
years and so they felt like if you came
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
up with a calculation that took 100
 
04:39:56.810 --> 04:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
years to get to a location you've
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
basically given it a lifetime protection
 
04:39:59.760 --> 04:40:01.130 align:start position:0%
basically given it a lifetime protection
to

04:40:01.130 --> 04:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:40:01.140 --> 04:40:01.850 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:40:01.850 --> 04:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
the significant water sources or well
 
04:40:07.610 --> 04:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
sites whatever you have aquifers that
 
04:40:09.170 --> 04:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
that you want to protect and so you'll
 
04:40:10.430 --> 04:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
see some of those setbacks come up
 
04:40:12.650 --> 04:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
further on down the page uh specifically
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
point to
 
04:40:14.400 --> 04:40:16.730 align:start position:0%
point to
um

04:40:16.730 --> 04:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.490 --> 04:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
line 27 and line 29 you'll see that
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
thousand foot sect back that's that's
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
the basic reason behind that setback and
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
how they came up with it in line 14 and
 
04:40:30.650 --> 04:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
line 16 you'll see 300 foot setbacks
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
those are those are for a bit of a
 
04:40:34.010 --> 04:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
different purpose one is from roads
 
04:40:36.770 --> 04:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
one's from the property boundary they
 
04:40:38.448 --> 04:40:38.458 align:start position:0%
felt like it gave them an adequate
 
04:40:40.270 --> 04:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
amount of space
 
04:40:44.630 --> 04:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
to both test for leakage and for
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
remediation so they want to be able to
 
04:40:49.730 --> 04:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
remediate that before it hits a road so
 
04:40:50.630 --> 04:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to deal with the
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
road they can deal with it before it
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
hits the road they don't want to have to
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
deal with it after it goes over the
 
04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
property boundary they want to be able
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with it inside the property
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
boundary as far as my understanding is
 
04:41:02.090 --> 04:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
goes that was kind of the rationale for
 
04:41:04.730 --> 04:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
the 300 foot setbacks there and then you
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
have in line 18 I'd just like to point
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
out a minimum thousand foot setback
 
04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
between the solid waste boundary and the
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
nearest Residence not owned by the
 
04:41:12.890 --> 04:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
applicants at the time the application
 
04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
is filed for the with the Department
 
04:41:15.890 --> 04:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
that has absolutely nothing to do with
 
04:41:17.448 --> 04:41:17.458 align:start position:0%
groundwater at all
 
04:41:18.770 --> 04:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that's basically in there
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
just for decency and consideration of
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
other people's property rights as well a
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
landfill is a pretty significant
 
04:41:27.650 --> 04:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
structure to be putting up and
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that's just there
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
because I felt it was reasonable to keep
 
04:41:33.050 --> 04:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
it that far away from the house that had
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
already been situated
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
um one last thing and then I will take
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
questions uh because it was mentioned
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
before unlike main statute on the first
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
page line seven you do see five years
 
04:41:45.948 --> 04:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
instead of six in Maine it is six and as
 
04:41:48.770 --> 04:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
a one of the previous speakers mentioned
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
um he didn't feel like five was actually
 
04:41:52.970 --> 04:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
adequate my understanding why it's five
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
here instead six is more for political
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
purposes than anything else
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the the longer the the time that we
 
04:42:02.510 --> 04:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
allow uh
 
04:42:06.288 --> 04:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
the less apt we are potentially to um be
 
04:42:09.050 --> 04:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
willing to hear out the bill so um I
 
04:42:10.368 --> 04:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
think for political reasons it was
 
04:42:12.650 --> 04:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
shortened although he may be correct it
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
may not be adequate
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and I said last thing but one last
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
thing uh I'd also just listening to the
 
04:42:19.490 --> 04:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
testimony be curious because I'm sure
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
people will be coming back up to testify
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
and they may be able to uh speak to it
 
04:42:24.650 --> 04:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that this bill is
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
site specific in its nature it is taking
 
04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
into consideration the variables of soil
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
composition speed flow seepage velocity
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
and those things would change from site
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
to site and the setbacks would as well I
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
mean we have minimum setbacks here that
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
would have to be adhered to but those
 
04:42:41.930 --> 04:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
can be adjusted according to the soil
 
04:42:44.930 --> 04:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
composition of a specific site this
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
isn't a one-size-fits-all it just gives
 
04:42:49.368 --> 04:42:49.378 align:start position:0%
minimums that we have to adhere to and
 
04:42:50.690 --> 04:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
then we can make adjustments from there
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
so having said that I'd be happy to take
 
04:42:54.890 --> 04:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:42:58.010 --> 04:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
so yes I my question initially is you
 
04:42:59.628 --> 04:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
know I took a look at all these
 
04:43:02.690 --> 04:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
different uh setbacks minimum setbacks
 
04:43:06.530 --> 04:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
and and I'm get this is taken from Main
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
law yes it is so
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
did they have any technical reasons for
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
these particular particular setback
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
numbers or footage or I mean they seem
 
04:43:20.448 --> 04:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
very arbitrary to me sure um so my
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
understanding on it um Madam chair is
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
that uh the last main statute's been in
 
04:43:28.610 --> 04:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
place since the Late Late 1980s uh they
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
did a significant review of it around I
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
believe it was 1999 or so they have done
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
a great deal of of work themselves the
 
04:43:38.690 --> 04:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
same kind of work that if we don't base
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
our model after somebody like me we
 
04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
would have to do as was stated by the DS
 
04:43:44.270 --> 04:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
they would bring in experts they would
 
04:43:46.490 --> 04:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know do their measurements and come
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
up with calculations my understanding
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
with speaking with people from Maine is
 
04:43:51.650 --> 04:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's what they have done uh to come up
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
with these setbacks I'm not going to
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
pretend to understand them thoroughly
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
myself because that's not my area of
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
expertise uh I do know that in talking
 
04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
to them the 300 foot setback from a
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
roadway or from a property line is what
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
they came to the conclusion was
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to be able to test and
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
remediate um
 
04:44:12.410 --> 04:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
before it hits an area that they don't
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
want to have to dig into somebody else's
 
04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
property or the road itself thank you
 
04:44:19.850 --> 04:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative datsey uh thank you
 
04:44:26.690 --> 04:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
madam chair yeah I think it's a line
 
04:44:30.410 --> 04:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
um 26 25 and 26 can you just explain
 
04:44:33.530 --> 04:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
that a minimum 100 foot setback between
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
the waste handling area I don't know
 
04:44:38.208 --> 04:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
what a waste handling area would be and
 
04:44:41.690 --> 04:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
cl and a classified surface water
 
04:44:43.610 --> 04:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative thank you for the
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
question um this is actually so as we
 
04:44:49.010 --> 04:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
all know doing this job sometimes things
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
are up against a tough timetable uh and
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
we wanted to get something for the
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee to to give consideration to
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually in Maine statute
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
um those hundred foot setbacks would
 
04:45:01.368 --> 04:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
traditionally be a 300 foot setback
 
04:45:02.690 --> 04:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and then through remediation
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
processes like we've been talking about
 
04:45:06.890 --> 04:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
you can lower that setback down to 100
 
04:45:06.900 --> 04:45:08.208 align:start position:0%
you can lower that setback down to 100
feet

04:45:08.208 --> 04:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
feet
 
04:45:08.218 --> 04:45:09.050 align:start position:0%
feet
um

04:45:09.050 --> 04:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are people who can probably speak
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
better to the specifics of it
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
um as far as what those things are
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
technically and I would leave that to
 
04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
them on either side I'm sure that they
 
04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
can probably explain that to you better
 
04:45:23.030 --> 04:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:26.810 --> 04:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.850 --> 04:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm so
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
the question about
 
04:45:33.840 --> 04:45:34.788 align:start position:0%
the question about
um

04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:38.650 --> 04:45:38.660 align:start position:0%
the 300 year excuse me 300 foot setback
 
04:45:38.660 --> 04:45:39.230 align:start position:0%
the 300 year excuse me 300 foot setback
[Music]

04:45:39.230 --> 04:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:45:39.240 --> 04:45:40.128 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:45:40.128 --> 04:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:42.770 --> 04:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
is that just
 
04:45:45.530 --> 04:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
a setback around or oh my understanding
 
04:45:48.410 --> 04:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
is Maine also has that it can't be over
 
04:45:51.050 --> 04:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
in aquifer for example uh yeah so that
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
would be uh thank you for the question
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
representative that would be if you flip
 
04:45:56.930 --> 04:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.570 --> 04:45:58.580 align:start position:0%
um line three actually on page two
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me the area within the solid
 
04:46:02.690 --> 04:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
waste boundary shall not lie over or be
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
within 300 feet of a significant sand or
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
gravel aquifer
 
04:46:07.490 --> 04:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's where that would come into play
 
04:46:09.708 --> 04:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh which is you know why the 100 foot
 
04:46:12.288 --> 04:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
setback seems strange further down uh
 
04:46:13.490 --> 04:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
because technically they should be
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
looking at those sand and gravel
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
deposits to see if they're an aquifer or
 
04:46:18.788 --> 04:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.610 --> 04:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:46:25.620 --> 04:46:28.490 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Creighton

04:46:28.490 --> 04:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.810 --> 04:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:46:29.820 --> 04:46:31.490 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair thank you
representative

04:46:31.490 --> 04:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:33.708 --> 04:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just trying to
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
push legislation through that makes
 
04:46:35.520 --> 04:46:36.350 align:start position:0%
push legislation through that makes
sense

04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
well last year we did that we pushed HP
 
04:46:43.250 --> 04:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
1454 through and and it was vetoed
 
04:46:46.610 --> 04:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
um very similar legislation to this if
 
04:46:49.070 --> 04:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
you accounted for the language requiring
 
04:46:51.770 --> 04:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
additional data and that data driven
 
04:46:51.780 --> 04:46:54.288 align:start position:0%
additional data and that data driven
solution

04:46:54.288 --> 04:46:54.298 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
um in in creating this bill and if so
 
04:46:57.120 --> 04:47:00.230 align:start position:0%
um in in creating this bill and if so
how

04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative if I understand you
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
correctly have I considered what data is
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
driving out
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
to the governor
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd do that last year weren't
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
you listening
 
04:47:12.890 --> 04:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
um so I mean this is this is a bit
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
different from last year's legislation
 
04:47:16.128 --> 04:47:16.138 align:start position:0%
it's also been in place in the state of
 
04:47:17.570 --> 04:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
Maine for
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
gosh uh 30 40 years now
 
04:47:22.970 --> 04:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess a question for the
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee to take into consideration and
 
04:47:25.610 --> 04:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
maybe ask to some of the other people
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
who are here who might have more
 
04:47:28.850 --> 04:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
information on it is do they have a
 
04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
problem citing landfills in the state of
 
04:47:30.900 --> 04:47:31.850 align:start position:0%
problem citing landfills in the state of
Maine

04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
04:47:33.890 --> 04:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
um is there any anticipation that and
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
why would that be that it would be more
 
04:47:37.550 --> 04:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to cite in New Hampshire than
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
it would be to site in Maine if we're
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
following the same criteria
 
04:47:41.160 --> 04:47:42.050 align:start position:0%
following the same criteria
um

04:47:42.050 --> 04:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:44.050 --> 04:47:44.060 align:start position:0%
uh once again
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for the committee that's
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know something that you'll have to
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
dig into deeper uh but you know that's
 
04:47:51.650 --> 04:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's my general premise is it's been
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
working in Maine for for decades now
 
04:47:56.690 --> 04:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
um and is it going to cause some
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
significant hardship to the state of New
 
04:47:59.448 --> 04:47:59.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to adopt something that seems
 
04:48:01.128 --> 04:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
to be working for them very well okay
 
04:48:04.850 --> 04:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:06.170 --> 04:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair and
 
04:48:08.570 --> 04:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:48:11.690 --> 04:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
in listening to the previous testimony
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
and listening to this
 
04:48:16.490 --> 04:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
um you're taking main law and applying
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
it to New Hampshire although New
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's geography is a lot different
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
than Maine
 
04:48:21.480 --> 04:48:22.730 align:start position:0%
than Maine
so

04:48:22.730 --> 04:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:24.890 --> 04:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
why would we take another State's
 
04:48:27.170 --> 04:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
language and put it into New Hampshire
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
statute when our geography is not the
 
04:48:30.120 --> 04:48:31.850 align:start position:0%
statute when our geography is not the
same

04:48:31.850 --> 04:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:48:32.570 --> 04:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:48:34.970 --> 04:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative I would say that when it
 
04:48:38.330 --> 04:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
comes to seepage velocity we're dealing
 
04:48:40.128 --> 04:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
with an issue from my perspective anyway
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
we would be dealing with an issue where
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to give setbacks that
 
04:48:47.330 --> 04:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
allow us to both recognize when a leak
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
has happened and then remediate that as
 
04:48:51.530 --> 04:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
well as prevent it to the greatest
 
04:48:54.288 --> 04:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
extent possible so whereas our geology
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
is different the calculations would also
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
be different but the concept would be
 
04:48:59.208 --> 04:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
um so we're trying to give ourselves a
 
04:49:04.010 --> 04:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
significant significant enough amount of
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
time to recognize a problem and address
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
that problem so I think from that
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
perspective working off of somebody
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
else's model that is working seems to
 
04:49:15.730 --> 04:49:15.740 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
 
04:49:15.740 --> 04:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
representative

04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
um Bixby sorry
 
04:49:19.740 --> 04:49:22.448 align:start position:0%
um Bixby sorry
yes

04:49:22.448 --> 04:49:22.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:24.590 --> 04:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that was objected to uh last
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
to last year's bill was that it did not
 
04:49:35.330 --> 04:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh sufficiently exempt existing
 
04:49:38.810 --> 04:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
expansions of existing landfills and
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
that the phrase new is given the way
 
04:49:47.410 --> 04:49:47.420 align:start position:0%
that it that is used in uh in Des rules
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh actually also applies to any
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
expansion so
 
04:49:55.250 --> 04:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
um is that is that something that you
 
04:49:58.490 --> 04:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
gave any thought to in your drafting
 
04:50:00.530 --> 04:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so that thank you for the question
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
um that is something that I really heard
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
for the first time today and happy to
 
04:50:07.550 --> 04:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
make an amendment for the committee to
 
04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that in particular I suppose
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
Waste Management
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
um would be an agreement with the bill
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah so happy to make that adjustment
 
04:50:20.330 --> 04:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray um thank
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um thank you for taking
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
my question as far as the definition I
 
04:50:27.470 --> 04:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
believe it's online
 
04:50:27.480 --> 04:50:29.990 align:start position:0%
believe it's online
um

04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.330 --> 04:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
well I don't have lines um but it is
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the uh definition of overlying
 
04:50:37.250 --> 04:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
an unstable area
 
04:50:37.260 --> 04:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
an unstable area
yes

04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:50:38.400 --> 04:50:39.050 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:50:39.050 --> 04:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a definition to describe
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
what is unstable is that a subduction
 
04:50:46.910 --> 04:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
zone is that a it's sinkhole like what
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
what what definition is being used to
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
describe something that's unstable thank
 
04:50:53.448 --> 04:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I'm
 
04:50:55.310 --> 04:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
not 100 sure so that would be something
 
04:50:56.330 --> 04:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
that the committee would have to look
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
further into
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
or perhaps somebody behind me would be
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
able to answer that better that's
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
possible as well
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Dotsy
 
04:51:08.690 --> 04:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yeah I I just have
 
04:51:11.090 --> 04:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
to ask this question
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
um where did why was this bill filed
 
04:51:16.730 --> 04:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
since there were so many other bills
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
filed regarding landsville because I'm
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
not seeing any of the sponsors being
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
part of the solid waste management or on
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
this committee so you know where did the
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
idea for this particular Bill come from
 
04:51:30.050 --> 04:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the for the question
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
and to address the number of co-sponsors
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
um it was very last minute we had to
 
04:51:35.930 --> 04:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
rush to get it into OLS and as we all
 
04:51:37.550 --> 04:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
remember getting things to OLS last
 
04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
minute was pretty challenging this time
 
04:51:39.000 --> 04:51:40.128 align:start position:0%
minute was pretty challenging this time
around

04:51:40.128 --> 04:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so considering the time frame we had
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
the number of co-sponsors we got I
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
thought was was
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
um fairly good
 
04:51:46.378 --> 04:51:47.448 align:start position:0%
um fairly good
um

04:51:47.448 --> 04:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
as you just witnessed I would say in the
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
last hearing a lot of conversation over
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
the last couple years has centered
 
04:51:55.490 --> 04:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
around Maine in particular
 
04:51:57.170 --> 04:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
um what Maine is doing what Maine isn't
 
04:51:58.730 --> 04:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
doing how does it work why is it
 
04:51:58.740 --> 04:52:00.170 align:start position:0%
doing how does it work why is it
applicable

04:52:00.170 --> 04:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so the idea for the legislation just
 
04:52:02.400 --> 04:52:03.170 align:start position:0%
um so the idea for the legislation just
came

04:52:03.170 --> 04:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
came
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
from the idea that if we brought Maine's
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
legislation forward you could debate
 
04:52:08.570 --> 04:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
that you could have the discussion over
 
04:52:09.770 --> 04:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
it and you could decide whether or not
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
it was fitting for New Hampshire
 
04:52:14.930 --> 04:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:52:18.490 --> 04:52:18.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none excuse me thank you for your
 
04:52:21.050 --> 04:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I would like
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
to call Nikki delude Roy
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my testimony and
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
bumping me a little bit on the schedule
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
much of my testimony today in the
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
written version that's going around
 
04:52:49.970 --> 04:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
repeats comments that I've made
 
04:52:53.208 --> 04:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
regarding HB 56 so I won't bear
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
repeating those here today
 
04:52:55.680 --> 04:52:56.330 align:start position:0%
repeating those here today
um

04:52:56.330 --> 04:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
but I do want to say that much of the
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
language in 602 is similar to House Bill
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
56 so I'm just going to focus on the
 
04:53:06.770 --> 04:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
differences and the specific language
 
04:53:09.288 --> 04:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
that got that seems to be pulled from
 
04:53:11.810 --> 04:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
the main Regis the main Solid Waste
 
04:53:11.820 --> 04:53:12.770 align:start position:0%
the main Regis the main Solid Waste
rules

04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:53:15.890 --> 04:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
as proposed HB 602 includes project
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement allowances that appear to
 
04:53:21.410 --> 04:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
have been exerted from portions of the
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
solid waste rules in Maine
 
04:53:26.810 --> 04:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
the allowances included in 602 should be
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
left to the experts at DES to develop in
 
04:53:32.570 --> 04:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
solid waste regulations in our state
 
04:53:34.730 --> 04:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
there are obvious problems with exert
 
04:53:37.310 --> 04:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
excerpting Provisions from one State's
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulations into another State's statute
 
04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
each state has different local and
 
04:53:46.250 --> 04:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
Regional geologic settings direct
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
application of these allowances from one
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
state to another ignores Regional
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
differences in geology that would
 
04:53:53.330 --> 04:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
typically be considered if these
 
04:53:55.010 --> 04:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
Provisions were left in the hands of the
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
experts at DES to develop in regulation
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
the excerpted sections would be included
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire statute without the
 
04:54:05.690 --> 04:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
applicable definitions to the earlier
 
04:54:07.730 --> 04:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
testimony that are critical for
 
04:54:09.410 --> 04:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
interpreting and implementing these
 
04:54:12.050 --> 04:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
allowances correctly requiring that that
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
Des develop new rules creating
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
definitions in statute
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
and leaving them with the untenable
 
04:54:21.410 --> 04:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
responsibility of trying to interpret
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
Statute in rule making rather than
 
04:54:25.730 --> 04:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
developing the rules directly that are
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
directly and truly protective of human
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
health and the environment to our state
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
specifically there are a number of
 
04:54:34.970 --> 04:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
locations like on line four for example
 
04:54:37.550 --> 04:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh that where a significant sand and
 
04:54:39.650 --> 04:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
gravel aquifer is referenced without
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
definition that definition exists in the
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
solid waste rules in Maine but is not
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
included here
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
line 23 again a significant groundwater
 
04:54:51.170 --> 04:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
aquifer again something that's defined
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
in main rules but not defined here
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
lines 25 and 26 A classified surface
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
water lacking definition here line 28
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
and 30 preliminary information report is
 
04:55:06.050 --> 04:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
not something that we use in the state
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but is a defined
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
document in the state of Maine and to
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
the earlier comment line 35 an unstable
 
04:55:15.890 --> 04:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
area is defined in main regulation but
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
not here in the statute
 
04:55:20.930 --> 04:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
to add to issues inherent in wholesale
 
04:55:23.208 --> 04:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
adopting ones state regulations into
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
another state statute several of the
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
excerpted provisions cited in hb602 have
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
actually been modified in a way that
 
04:55:33.650 --> 04:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
makes them ambiguous or impractical in
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
04:55:37.810 --> 04:55:37.820 align:start position:0%
for one as one example
 
04:55:42.288 --> 04:55:42.298 align:start position:0%
section 4 B3 indicates and I quote the
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
area within the solid waste boundary
 
04:55:45.890 --> 04:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
shall be located on soils with
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient fines and clay-sized
 
04:55:49.010 --> 04:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
particles to minimize leachate
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
infiltration every measurement made of
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
in-situ soils within the property shall
 
04:55:56.448 --> 04:55:56.458 align:start position:0%
have an undisturbed hydraulic
 
04:55:59.090 --> 04:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
conductivity less than or equal to 1
 
04:56:01.010 --> 04:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
times 10 to the negative 5 centimeters
 
04:56:03.230 --> 04:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
per second end quote
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
as indicated in earlier testimony actual
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
geologic conditions vary wildly and
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
naturally across the site and the
 
04:56:14.690 --> 04:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
subsurface heterogeneity is an expected
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
and natural geologic Factor at all Sites
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
requiring an entire area and every
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
measurement to meet a specific Criterion
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
is arbitrary and technically unjustified
 
04:56:27.050 --> 04:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
and right and quite frankly
 
04:56:27.060 --> 04:56:28.670 align:start position:0%
and right and quite frankly
impracticable

04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
impracticable
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
for the reasons outlined in my testimony
 
04:56:33.708 --> 04:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
or urge the committee not to support 602
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
and to prevent the language from a
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
proposed in 602 from making its way into
 
04:56:41.150 --> 04:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute but rather to
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
continue to support DES in evaluating
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
and updating their Solid Waste
 
04:56:47.448 --> 04:56:47.458 align:start position:0%
regulations as this is the right
 
04:56:49.550 --> 04:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism to provide the protection that
 
04:56:51.410 --> 04:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
is ultimately sought in this bill as
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.610 --> 04:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:56:58.620 --> 04:57:00.410 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
um so

04:57:00.410 --> 04:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:57:03.890 --> 04:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
previous question to the sponsor of the
 
04:57:03.900 --> 04:57:05.230 align:start position:0%
previous question to the sponsor of the
bill

04:57:05.230 --> 04:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:57:08.288 --> 04:57:08.298 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:57:11.570 --> 04:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
with regards to Maine's geography is not
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
the same as New Hampshire's and you kind
 
04:57:16.368 --> 04:57:16.378 align:start position:0%
of touched upon that
 
04:57:19.368 --> 04:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
um but the answer to that was that
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
basically while we have it's the concept
 
04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
um what's your what's your thoughts on
 
04:57:29.208 --> 04:57:29.218 align:start position:0%
that is isn't the concept the same well
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
I guess I would suggest that the best
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
people to determine that are The
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
Regulators at DES the experts who we
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
have at the state to determine what is
 
04:57:38.930 --> 04:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
applicable from one state to the other
 
04:57:41.690 --> 04:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
and what is not applicable given this
 
04:57:43.730 --> 04:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
differences in geology and geography and
 
04:57:43.740 --> 04:57:45.288 align:start position:0%
differences in geology and geography and
topography

04:57:45.288 --> 04:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
topography
 
04:57:48.288 --> 04:57:48.298 align:start position:0%
so do in your opinion do you think that
 
04:57:51.288 --> 04:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
because of the difference in the
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
geologic makeup between the two states
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill would exempt a whole lot
 
04:58:01.010 --> 04:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
more land or include a whole lot more
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
land than say Maine
 
04:58:06.288 --> 04:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
I I believe that that's the case and in
 
04:58:09.050 --> 04:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
particular I believe that that's a very
 
04:58:09.060 --> 04:58:10.250 align:start position:0%
particular I believe that that's a very
important

04:58:10.250 --> 04:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
point because the definitions behind a
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
number of the terms included here are
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
left out of this of this bill so there
 
04:58:21.050 --> 04:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
isn't anything to go back to so someone
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
will have to define those particular
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
terms and if defined differently than
 
04:58:28.368 --> 04:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
Maine or in if defined in a way that
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
isn't applicable to New Hampshire that
 
04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
certainly could result
 
04:58:35.208 --> 04:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
04:58:37.490 --> 04:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
committee representative germana thank
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
my question and it's connected I'm sure
 
04:58:42.410 --> 04:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
to the to the chairwoman's question but
 
04:58:44.570 --> 04:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
as a scientist and I understand what
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
you're saying and you've made some very
 
04:58:47.930 --> 04:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
compelling points about uh terms that
 
04:58:50.810 --> 04:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
are defined in a statute or rules in
 
04:58:53.150 --> 04:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
Maine that are in this bill and we don't
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
have the rules to Define them but I do
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
want to come back to this question about
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
for example seepage velocity right so as
 
04:59:04.128 --> 04:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
a scientist I understand the geological
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
well I understand that there are
 
04:59:06.890 --> 04:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
geological differences they won't
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
pretend to understand what they are but
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
isn't seepage rate in in some sense a
 
04:59:13.970 --> 04:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
constant so regardless of of the
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
geologic makeup seepage velocity would
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
seem to me to be a constant measure that
 
04:59:22.850 --> 04:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
would be applicable regardless of what
 
04:59:25.788 --> 04:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
the geological makeup is
 
04:59:28.250 --> 04:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
well um so thank you for your question
 
04:59:30.288 --> 04:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
um seepage velocity really reflects the
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
geology right and so if in very
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
simplistic example if I'm at a site and
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's a sand lens and otherwise a clay
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
environment the seepage velocity within
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
that that coarser grain material is
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
going to be higher than in the
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
neighboring or surrounding clay and silt
 
04:59:49.550 --> 04:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
units and so it does vary from location
 
04:59:52.368 --> 04:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
to location and so in that simplistic
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
example if I were trying to cite a
 
04:59:58.010 --> 04:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
landfill and the entire site was in
 
05:00:00.350 --> 05:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
glacial till very low permeability
 
05:00:03.410 --> 05:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
material there are lenses of sand and
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
gravel within that material generally
 
05:00:07.850 --> 05:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
everywhere across the state so you'd be
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
basically concluding see digital
 
05:00:12.410 --> 05:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
velocity at that maximum location in
 
05:00:15.050 --> 05:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
this lens that may be discontinuous and
 
05:00:17.150 --> 05:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
not really impact the overall seepage
 
05:00:19.368 --> 05:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
velocity at a particular site when you
 
05:00:20.830 --> 05:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
look at it as a whole
 
05:00:22.990 --> 05:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you madam chair
 
05:00:25.730 --> 05:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative knabb thank you madam
 
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
um can we interpret your support for Des
 
05:00:31.730 --> 05:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
making these rules to say that you would
 
05:00:34.368 --> 05:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
support the path presented by the Senate
 
05:00:37.250 --> 05:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
which would ask Des to address these
 
05:00:38.570 --> 05:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
rules and look at them or do you think
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
what is currently I'm sorry we cannot uh
 
05:00:44.090 --> 05:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
reference the Senate bill at all because
 
05:00:46.128 --> 05:00:46.138 align:start position:0%
we're talking about this Hospital would
 
05:00:48.890 --> 05:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
you support a process that that directed
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
Des to evaluate the current rules around
 
05:00:53.150 --> 05:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
landfall citing or do you think the
 
05:00:57.410 --> 05:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
current rules are adequate is that
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
I would completely support a um process
 
05:01:06.050 --> 05:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
that would allow Des to consider all the
 
05:01:10.368 --> 05:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.128 --> 05:01:13.138 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:01:14.810 --> 05:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
05:01:17.570 --> 05:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
afternoon appreciate it thank you I'd
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%

I am a retired Presbyterian minister
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
and for the last 20 years I've also been
 
05:01:43.550 --> 05:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
chair of the center of theological
 
05:01:46.368 --> 05:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
inquiry in Princeton New Jersey
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
Where We Gather Scholars to take on what
 
05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
they call life's Wicked questions
 
05:01:55.250 --> 05:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with one of life's Wicked
 
05:01:55.260 --> 05:01:56.750 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with one of life's Wicked
questions

05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
for those of you who haven't been here
 
05:02:00.890 --> 05:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
for four years this is the fourth year
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
in a row I've had the pleasure of
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
talking with you about the issue of
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
landfill citing but today I don't want
 
05:02:11.570 --> 05:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
to talk to you about the technicalities
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to talk to you about the
 
05:02:13.440 --> 05:02:14.930 align:start position:0%
I don't want to talk to you about the
science

05:02:14.930 --> 05:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
science
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
I want to talk to you about something
 
05:02:16.440 --> 05:02:18.350 align:start position:0%
I want to talk to you about something
else

05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:02:20.090 --> 05:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you'll hear all the
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
technicalities and I've heard all the
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that many of you if not most
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
of you are people of Faith you would
 
05:02:32.510 --> 05:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
call yourself a person of faith I don't
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
know where that would be Christian
 
05:02:36.530 --> 05:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
Muslim Jewish whatever but someone who
 
05:02:38.650 --> 05:02:38.660 align:start position:0%
has a sense of accountability to God
 
05:02:41.330 --> 05:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
after all when you took your oath of
 
05:02:44.690 --> 05:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
office you said so help me God did you
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
not now if in fact you have a problem
 
05:02:50.090 --> 05:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
with swearing in God's name you said
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
under what
 
05:02:58.970 --> 05:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.730 --> 05:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
I do this under pains and penalty of
 
05:03:03.530 --> 05:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
perjury was that the phrase thank you
 
05:03:05.690 --> 05:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
consequently what I want to talk to you
 
05:03:05.700 --> 05:03:06.708 align:start position:0%
consequently what I want to talk to you
about

05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:03:09.050 --> 05:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
I want you to consider this bill or
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
actually these two bills I chose to
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
speak only this evening at this point
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
I want you to think about it from the
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
perspective of faith
 
05:03:21.050 --> 05:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
the Book of Genesis tells us that in the
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
beginning God created the heavens and
 
05:03:26.448 --> 05:03:26.458 align:start position:0%
the Earth and that everything in them
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
was good
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
and God gave this gift of creation to us
 
05:03:34.850 --> 05:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
and it had in it everything that is
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
needed for life but God gave it to us as
 
05:03:39.890 --> 05:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
God's stewards
 
05:03:42.288 --> 05:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
now it turns out this gift is
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily fruitful
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not simply brimming with life it is
 
05:03:50.810 --> 05:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
alive itself
 
05:03:52.550 --> 05:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
those of you who are farmers know this
 
05:03:52.560 --> 05:03:54.530 align:start position:0%
those of you who are farmers know this
already

05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:03:57.050 --> 05:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
I have here in my hands a book by Dr
 
05:03:59.448 --> 05:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
David Greenspan one of the members at
 
05:04:02.510 --> 05:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
CTI who was part of our initial study
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
into the ramifications of finding other
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
life in The Exodus Dr Greenspan Dr
 
05:04:14.090 --> 05:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
greenspoon is a member at CTI he is a
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
planetary scientist and now an
 
05:04:18.530 --> 05:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
astrobiologist and he's written this
 
05:04:22.850 --> 05:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
book Earth in human hands shaping our
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.448 --> 05:04:29.458 align:start position:0%
Dr Greenspun makes the point that Earth
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
is the only planet in our solar system
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
that is alive
 
05:04:37.610 --> 05:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
we alone have a biosphere to bring forth
 
05:04:40.250 --> 05:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
nurture and sustain life and in this
 
05:04:43.490 --> 05:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
book he talks about the consequences
 
05:04:46.970 --> 05:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
of life on Earth because of the
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
decisions we human beings have been
 
05:04:52.270 --> 05:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
making and the story is not heartening
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Anderson we need to be talking about
 
05:04:58.128 --> 05:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
this bill I am please I'm talking about
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
the criteria that you use by which you
 
05:05:01.798 --> 05:05:03.230 align:start position:0%
the criteria that you use by which you
decide

05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
decide
 
05:05:06.350 --> 05:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
what the environment is about that will
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
enable us to continue to live we are
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
looking to see whether there are aspects
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill that are uh
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
favorable or not and so I would like to
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
keep to the the body of the bill and and
 
05:05:22.730 --> 05:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
with all due respect I've talked and
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
I've talked to you about the body of the
 
05:05:26.570 --> 05:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
bill for three years
 
05:05:28.368 --> 05:05:28.378 align:start position:0%
with all due respect I'd like to talk to
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
you about how you're going to approach
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
making these decisions
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
as people who are ethical as people who
 
05:05:39.530 --> 05:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
are concerned about life on this planet
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
as people who are concerned about those
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
who may come after us please keep your
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
comments to the topic of the legislation
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
and whether or not it should be passed
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
or not okay first of all I'm absolutely
 
05:05:56.208 --> 05:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
convinced that either one of the bills
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
could be passed and secondly probably
 
05:06:01.490 --> 05:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
you may well want to combine the two of
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
them to find to answer some of the small
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
technological questions you've had but
 
05:06:08.090 --> 05:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's very clear
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
that if we don't do something to stop
 
05:06:13.550 --> 05:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on in New Hampshire we're
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
destroying ourselves
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we will destroy the Earth and that's
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
what Dr greenspoon is saying so he's
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
saying we have a chance and the Chance
 
05:06:26.208 --> 05:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
is for adopting bills like this is it
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
the full solution absolutely not it's
 
05:06:31.128 --> 05:06:31.138 align:start position:0%
simply lighting one candle rather than
 
05:06:33.890 --> 05:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
cursing the darkness so what I urge you
 
05:06:37.128 --> 05:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
to do is to vote ought to pass if you
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
want to merge the two bills gladly merge
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
them make them even better you folks
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to do that
 
05:06:46.128 --> 05:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
and then pass it and then let's do
 
05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
everything we can to see that the Senate
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
agrees and thereafter let's see if this
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
time our governor will take what the
 
05:06:58.368 --> 05:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
people of this state need seriously
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
Anderson any questions
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you and I
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
would like to Now call Dr Adam Finkel
 
05:07:23.090 --> 05:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
breathe easier excuse me thank you again
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
for a chance to come back I'll be brief
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
I hope uh maybe like sentence at a time
 
05:07:36.170 --> 05:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
little sound bites uh
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
first I would just urge you if you have
 
05:07:39.770 --> 05:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
either one minute or four minutes to
 
05:07:42.170 --> 05:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
take a look I sent you all uh two links
 
05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
to YouTubes a a Charming 13 year old
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
middle school student last year put
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
together a video uh that I also cut to
 
05:07:51.650 --> 05:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
one minute just to show
 
05:07:54.410 --> 05:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
it nothing substitutes for seeing it in
 
05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
real time how different good soil and
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
good Bedrock is from sand and gravel and
 
05:08:02.750 --> 05:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
05:08:05.330 --> 05:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
funnels full of colored water the ones
 
05:08:07.490 --> 05:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
with the clay underneath it were sitting
 
05:08:09.050 --> 05:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
there for a whole week before we started
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that demonstration and not a drop
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
fell into the beaker below the sand and
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
gravel we did in real time and within a
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
few seconds all the liquid had
 
05:08:19.730 --> 05:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
percolated through and again the beauty
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
of that experiment is it's six out of
 
05:08:24.050 --> 05:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
seven funnels have Clay because six out
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
of seven randomly chose in sites in New
 
05:08:28.330 --> 05:08:28.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be acceptable
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologically for a new landfill
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
uh secondly
 
05:08:36.410 --> 05:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
I I frankly I've heard some unscientific
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
things here today the questions we're
 
05:08:41.868 --> 05:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh the the errors
 
05:08:44.270 --> 05:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
corrected and they didn't didn't work uh
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you drop a tennis ball here in this
 
05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
room it will fall to the ground in a
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time and if you I
 
05:08:52.250 --> 05:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
guarantee if you go across the border to
 
05:08:56.330 --> 05:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
Maine gravity works the same way so
 
05:08:59.208 --> 05:08:59.218 align:start position:0%
the my understanding is that the amount
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
of acceptable land in Maine and New
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire May differ slightly but the as
 
05:09:05.930 --> 05:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
you said representative germano the
 
05:09:07.788 --> 05:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
concept is the same it doesn't change
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere on Earth you can measure
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
velocity and you can apply it to change
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
velocity to time
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
and so the fact that Maine may have
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
slightly different ramifications that
 
05:09:20.690 --> 05:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
that may be more or less of their land
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
would be uh made unsuitable for
 
05:09:27.288 --> 05:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
landfilling by by their law and regs
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
what we know is in New Hampshire the
 
05:09:31.730 --> 05:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
vast majority of sites would still be
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
applicable under either of these bills
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh the question of Statute versus
 
05:09:40.430 --> 05:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
regulation so I don't want to go into a
 
05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
long history here so I was the chief
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
scientist at the federal occupational
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
safety and health administration in the
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
Clinton Administration and the Bush
 
05:09:50.330 --> 05:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
Administration I wrote rules I wrote the
 
05:09:52.490 --> 05:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
federal respirator Rule and a number of
 
05:09:55.010 --> 05:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
others but we also on occasion were
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
directed by Congress to
 
05:10:00.288 --> 05:10:00.298 align:start position:0%
implement verbatim rules that Congress
 
05:10:03.890 --> 05:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
wrote for us there were times for each I
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe this is a time for statute
 
05:10:08.810 --> 05:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
because of the difficulties the Des has
 
05:10:11.090 --> 05:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
and look frankly I don't really
 
05:10:13.970 --> 05:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
understand what Des is supporting or not
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
supporting today at one point it was we
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
need more discretion we don't like being
 
05:10:21.170 --> 05:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
micromanaged at another point we don't
 
05:10:22.850 --> 05:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
like the table of offsets because it
 
05:10:25.128 --> 05:10:25.138 align:start position:0%
gives us too much discretion this is a
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
time for the legislature to speak with
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
broad Strokes of policy now I don't
 
05:10:32.030 --> 05:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
profess to have been here at the time
 
05:10:34.850 --> 05:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
but I think whoever was here did a great
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
thing I don't know 20 years ago it's
 
05:10:39.288 --> 05:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
called Jessica's law not Jessica's
 
05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
rulemaking right you guys decided your
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
predecessors that that piles of snow on
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
the roof of a car were a bad idea and
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
somebody got killed and I'm I'm sure
 
05:10:50.810 --> 05:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
somebody were getting a lot of static up
 
05:10:53.208 --> 05:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
and Dalton you're being reactive to uh
 
05:10:55.010 --> 05:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
to a problem well yeah all good
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
legislation is reactive we have a real
 
05:10:59.330 --> 05:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
problem somebody trying to dig bury 18
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
million tons of trash in a sand pit next
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
to a lake and so we're asking for a
 
05:11:04.850 --> 05:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
reaction just like Jessica's parents
 
05:11:07.128 --> 05:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
asked for a reaction but you didn't have
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
a study you didn't send it to rule
 
05:11:11.208 --> 05:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
making you made policy and that's what
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
we're hoping you will do uh in this case
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think just one or two more quick
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
things the distinction between using the
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
maximum measured value and some average
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
I said earlier today
 
05:11:25.010 --> 05:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
frankly the problem with the average is
 
05:11:27.650 --> 05:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's easily manipulable by moneyed
 
05:11:30.410 --> 05:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
interests who want to manipulate the
 
05:11:30.420 --> 05:11:31.310 align:start position:0%
interests who want to manipulate the
game

05:11:31.310 --> 05:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
game
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
so I agree that there are value
 
05:11:35.628 --> 05:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
judgments to be made here whether we
 
05:11:37.250 --> 05:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
want to use the maximum value or the
 
05:11:38.930 --> 05:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
average value but let's not pretend one
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
is unscientific and one is not they're
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
both science policy judgments and it's a
 
05:11:47.330 --> 05:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
feature of these two bills that they
 
05:11:47.340 --> 05:11:48.910 align:start position:0%
feature of these two bills that they
require

05:11:48.910 --> 05:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
the applicant to sample as little or as
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
much as they want but they're Bound by
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
the highest value they get because
 
05:11:58.010 --> 05:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
that's a real number for somebody to say
 
05:12:00.350 --> 05:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
well it might just be a lens that only
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
goes in One Direction that's a real
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
number and it says the the leachate will
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
Flow Away from the site at a high rate
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
of speed through that formation
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's
 
05:12:13.010 --> 05:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
tilted towards Environmental Protection
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
more than tilted towards profit but of
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
course I think that's a good value
 
05:12:19.810 --> 05:12:19.820 align:start position:0%
judgment so let's not be fooled by this
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
random utterances of unscientific nature
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the both these bills are science
 
05:12:26.330 --> 05:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
based the only real difference between
 
05:12:27.890 --> 05:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
them if you're really kind of puzzled
 
05:12:31.010 --> 05:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
about the the numbers in the language I
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
think I can make it real simple the main
 
05:12:38.090 --> 05:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
or the bill 602 is more stringent in one
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
one important respect it follows the
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
main uh concept that you should if you
 
05:12:46.730 --> 05:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
go to a site as a developer you dig your
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
first test well you find you're in a
 
05:12:51.650 --> 05:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
sand pit pack up and go away there's no
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
variance there's no uh allowance for
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
that no matter how far away the water is
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
Maine says why on Earth would you dig in
 
05:13:00.770 --> 05:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
a sand pit
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
56 doesn't quite say it that way it says
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
if you're five years away in a sand pit
 
05:13:08.570 --> 05:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
we're okay with that so I prefer
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
56 because I think it's more of a
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
balance between protecting the water and
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
not digging in the wrong place but I see
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
the real Merit in a in a more uh
 
05:13:21.770 --> 05:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
protective more easily understandable
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
prohibition which is what is in 602.
 
05:13:26.160 --> 05:13:28.128 align:start position:0%
prohibition which is what is in 602.
um

05:13:28.128 --> 05:13:28.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
and I think that's it the only other
 
05:13:32.090 --> 05:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
really interesting point is about last
 
05:13:34.910 --> 05:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
year's veto uh you know are either these
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
bills sufficiently different to escape
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
another veto and all I will say is at
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
some point I hope the governor listens
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
to some of the industry that is saying
 
05:13:44.690 --> 05:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
enough is enough we need a better system
 
05:13:47.208 --> 05:13:47.218 align:start position:0%
and I think it's quite appropriate to
 
05:13:50.690 --> 05:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
try one more time uh a bill that is
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
Laden with uh I won't call them
 
05:13:55.970 --> 05:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
concessions they are valuable uh
 
05:13:58.250 --> 05:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
balances to what industry itself asked
 
05:13:58.260 --> 05:13:59.750 align:start position:0%
balances to what industry itself asked
for

05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh representative Bixby go
 
05:14:05.340 --> 05:14:06.850 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh representative Bixby go
ahead

05:14:06.850 --> 05:14:06.860 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
05:14:09.708 --> 05:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
one of the objections that was raised to
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh 602 and I I I must confess I'm a
 
05:14:18.890 --> 05:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
little bit uh sympathetic to this is the
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
lack of definitions do you think that's
 
05:14:23.448 --> 05:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
a flaw that would need to be fixed
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it could be fixed pretty
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
easily my understanding is that uh
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of the definitions in the in the
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
main system are just cross-reference to
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
main statutes which would not be
 
05:14:36.530 --> 05:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
objectionable if they were simply
 
05:14:39.410 --> 05:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
repeated verbatim as as you know as a
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
definition section I don't think the
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
definitions in Maine are in any way uh
 
05:14:45.890 --> 05:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or bizarre it's just they
 
05:14:47.868 --> 05:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
are terms of art like like sensitive
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
receptors they have their own name for
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
that and we ought to either figure out
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
whether we have exactly the same term of
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
art or need to sort of paste it back in
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
as a reminder
 
05:15:01.490 --> 05:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh and I that representative
 
05:15:09.410 --> 05:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
bixby's question reminded me of the the
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
map the much disputed map that we've
 
05:15:14.570 --> 05:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
discussed and it says that the sources
 
05:15:17.330 --> 05:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
was New Hampshire Des but adapted from
 
05:15:20.930 --> 05:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
U.S uh GS and so I'm wondering in terms
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
of definitions is is there some overlap
 
05:15:28.930 --> 05:15:28.940 align:start position:0%
also through USGS in terms of of
 
05:15:31.490 --> 05:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
defining some of these geological
 
05:15:32.990 --> 05:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics you were talking about
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
kind of what Mains are based on but is
 
05:15:38.330 --> 05:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
there also a larger body through USGS
 
05:15:40.670 --> 05:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
for example that contains definitions as
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
well oh USGS is is using words like uh
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
clay or they're using words like glacial
 
05:15:50.930 --> 05:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
till whereas main is using a very very
 
05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
precise number 100
 
05:15:53.930 --> 05:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
000 centimeters per second which is
 
05:15:57.050 --> 05:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
about 10 feet per year uh so yeah I
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
prefer the main system but the map is
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
just to show you know in a in a easily
 
05:16:04.850 --> 05:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
understandable graphical form that
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
within a lot of uh approximation and a
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of play
 
05:16:12.170 --> 05:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
86 percent of the state is prima facie
 
05:16:13.788 --> 05:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
probably a decent place to put a
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
landfill it's only to say that all of
 
05:16:17.810 --> 05:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
this sky is falling talk about we're
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
never going to be able to put another
 
05:16:21.050 --> 05:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
landfill if you split really hard you'll
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
see that little yellow Square on that
 
05:16:25.490 --> 05:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
map in the legend that is all the land
 
05:16:27.708 --> 05:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
we need for the rest of the century to
 
05:16:29.930 --> 05:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
bury our trash if we can't find a little
 
05:16:32.170 --> 05:16:32.180 align:start position:0%
yellow Square in that vast green area
 
05:16:34.550 --> 05:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
something's wrong with us we don't need
 
05:16:36.410 --> 05:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
to go into the worst possible locations
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
to look for landfilling may I follow up
 
05:16:41.208 --> 05:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
Madam chair follow up thank you uh and
 
05:16:44.090 --> 05:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
my question really was about so are you
 
05:16:46.850 --> 05:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
familiar with where those main as you
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
said they're much more specific they're
 
05:16:49.970 --> 05:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
much more precise in terms of how they
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Define clay Etc uh do you know were
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
those developed by geologists in Maine
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
or or do you know where they got that
 
05:17:02.930 --> 05:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
data I've talked to the the counterparts
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
in in Maine uh uh who do the same job
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr Wimsatt does and what they've
 
05:17:10.190 --> 05:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
told me is they picked 100 000
 
05:17:12.350 --> 05:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
centimeters per year because it was
 
05:17:15.170 --> 05:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
again 10 10 feet per second I'm sorry 10
 
05:17:17.448 --> 05:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
feet per year they wanted about a
 
05:17:19.090 --> 05:17:19.100 align:start position:0%
hundred years
 
05:17:24.050 --> 05:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
for uh in all cases for the the leachate
 
05:17:27.530 --> 05:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
to Traverse uh a a long enough distance
 
05:17:29.570 --> 05:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
that they were comfortable
 
05:17:31.128 --> 05:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
you in other words even though I had a
 
05:17:33.170 --> 05:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
six-year thing in their in their legs
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
they were really thinking about a
 
05:17:37.010 --> 05:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
hundred years as the kind of lead time
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
that we really would would like to have
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
so while they have variances and they
 
05:17:43.128 --> 05:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
have offsets and ways to get closer than
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
100 years they were really looking at
 
05:17:47.150 --> 05:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
let's just not set ourselves up for
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
trouble by digging in what is
 
05:17:50.930 --> 05:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
essentially sand and gravel but they're
 
05:17:52.128 --> 05:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
putting a number on it they're putting
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
on that 10 to the minus fifth
 
05:17:55.430 --> 05:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
centimeters per second to to to mimic
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
Sand and Gravel thank you and thank you
 
05:17:59.090 --> 05:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
05:18:08.930 --> 05:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and to me it seems I I a question
 
05:18:13.610 --> 05:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
about uh The veto again
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the the prohibitions have to
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
do with human interaction with the the
 
05:18:21.410 --> 05:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
site right the near roads near property
 
05:18:23.090 --> 05:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
boundaries do you think that that will
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
make it less passable
 
05:18:28.128 --> 05:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
um or or harder make it harder to get it
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
past the governor
 
05:18:33.230 --> 05:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
well yeah I think you're probably I mean
 
05:18:34.368 --> 05:18:34.378 align:start position:0%
I think it will take a little more
 
05:18:38.330 --> 05:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
education uh for uh the sponsors or the
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
the proponents to explain why there is
 
05:18:42.650 --> 05:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
why there are so many different sub
 
05:18:45.170 --> 05:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
paragraphs talking about residences and
 
05:18:47.930 --> 05:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh and and other as as representative
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
Simon said human decency uh issues here
 
05:18:53.090 --> 05:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
but I would hope that those wouldn't be
 
05:18:54.770 --> 05:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
controversial that if somebody would
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
take the time to listen that sort of
 
05:18:56.820 --> 05:18:58.070 align:start position:0%
take the time to listen that sort of
again

05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
with all due respect you know 44 pages
 
05:19:02.990 --> 05:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
of operation maintenance closure ranks
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
are great but the but the one and a half
 
05:19:06.530 --> 05:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
pages of citing criteria in our state
 
05:19:09.288 --> 05:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
are not nearly enough so it looks like a
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
lot of verbiage but it's because it's
 
05:19:13.330 --> 05:19:13.340 align:start position:0%
being overlaid over really
 
05:19:18.410 --> 05:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:19:22.910 --> 05:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Now call uh director Mike
 
05:19:28.440 --> 05:19:30.050 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Now call uh director Mike

05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair thank you
 
05:19:45.000 --> 05:19:45.948 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair thank you
again

05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:19:47.208 --> 05:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Mike
 
05:19:49.070 --> 05:19:49.080 align:start position:0%

Sanborn

05:19:58.610 --> 05:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
Sanborn
 
05:20:01.490 --> 05:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
um as a lot has been said here about the
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the similarities between this bill and
 
05:20:06.050 --> 05:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 56 and and there are indeed
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
some similarities and I won't I won't
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
repeat my testimony relative to those
 
05:20:12.650 --> 05:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
similarities but I would note that a
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
very significant difference with this
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
bill or a couple of them but but one is
 
05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
that it uh looks to set a a five-year
 
05:20:23.090 --> 05:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
travel time distance for not just
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
surface waters but for this category of
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
sensitive receptors and sensitive
 
05:20:30.288 --> 05:20:30.298 align:start position:0%
receptors is is quite broadly defined in
 
05:20:32.330 --> 05:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
the in the bill to include certain
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
aquifers Water Supplies sand and gravel
 
05:20:36.890 --> 05:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
deposits which are not defined in
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
perennial surface and then of course
 
05:20:40.270 --> 05:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
perennial surface waters
 
05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
so that that means it has a
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
significantly greater impact in terms of
 
05:20:49.628 --> 05:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
what what different features need to be
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
have a have a setback determined for
 
05:20:52.200 --> 05:20:54.708 align:start position:0%
have a have a setback determined for
them

05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would say is that with
 
05:20:59.690 --> 05:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
respect to the undefined nature of this
 
05:21:01.610 --> 05:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
broad the broad definition of sensitive
 
05:21:03.770 --> 05:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
receptors but the but the terms within
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
that being undefined it creates some
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
some difficulties one is that if Santa
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
gravel deposits isn't defined and that
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
depending on how you define that that
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
can describe much of the of the
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
overburdened soils in New Hampshire
 
05:21:21.650 --> 05:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
um and certainly at sites where there
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
may well be other soils that are much
 
05:21:26.330 --> 05:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
less permeable and might meet the
 
05:21:28.850 --> 05:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
criteria in the bill but there are sand
 
05:21:31.010 --> 05:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
and gravel deposits often closely
 
05:21:33.530 --> 05:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
associated with those very same slow
 
05:21:37.730 --> 05:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
flowing soils and the the issue uh I
 
05:21:39.530 --> 05:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
think it's been it's been addressed a
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
little bit but I will repeat it the the
 
05:21:44.270 --> 05:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
idea that all soils at a site need to
 
05:21:46.430 --> 05:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
meet the 10 to the minus 5 centimeter
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
per second criteria that's not something
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's terribly common the way that the
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
bill and the words matter here it's easy
 
05:21:54.410 --> 05:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
to say well we just mean we want the
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
sites to be in places where water
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't move that fast but the reality
 
05:22:00.410 --> 05:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
is that there may be sites where water
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't move very fast but those sites
 
05:22:04.250 --> 05:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
will also have soils that have
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
permeabilities that are much greater
 
05:22:07.730 --> 05:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
than 10 to the minus 5 centimeters per
 
05:22:10.190 --> 05:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
second so if you say all the soils at
 
05:22:12.170 --> 05:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
the property need to meet that criteria
 
05:22:14.810 --> 05:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
it's really unrealistic and and probably
 
05:22:16.910 --> 05:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
that combined with these other terms not
 
05:22:19.550 --> 05:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
being adequately defined results in a
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
situation where virtually no site could
 
05:22:24.530 --> 05:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
be could be could be deemed acceptable
 
05:22:27.410 --> 05:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
for a landfill sighting and I I'm not an
 
05:22:29.570 --> 05:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
expert on how Maine applies their laws I
 
05:22:31.250 --> 05:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
don't know the definitions of these
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
terms in the main rules I think much of
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is contained in rural in Maine
 
05:22:39.288 --> 05:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
rather than in law but the words really
 
05:22:41.448 --> 05:22:41.458 align:start position:0%
matter here and before we could embark
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
on changing the statute in a way that
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
that uses these rules in my view in a
 
05:22:49.010 --> 05:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
way that is careless is we could end up
 
05:22:50.570 --> 05:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
with the result that we none of us
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
really anticipates
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I I think I'll just leave it at that
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
and entertain any questions unless Mark
 
05:22:58.190 --> 05:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
wants that yeah I'll just really quickly
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
following the chair's guidance of course
 
05:23:03.530 --> 05:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
just say this bill does not outline the
 
05:23:05.628 --> 05:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
approach we would be recommending or
 
05:23:12.410 --> 05:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.150 --> 05:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thank you again
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
for your your testimony and
 
05:23:24.288 --> 05:23:24.298 align:start position:0%
uh so you heard the previous testimony
 
05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
it said that uh
 
05:23:28.740 --> 05:23:28.750 align:start position:0%
that basically This was
 
05:23:28.750 --> 05:23:29.330 align:start position:0%
that basically This was
[Music]

05:23:29.330 --> 05:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:23:29.340 --> 05:23:30.650 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:23:30.650 --> 05:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:33.410 --> 05:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
a good way to go about doing this your
 
05:23:36.170 --> 05:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
testimony says it's not a good way about
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
going there so how would you advise us
 
05:23:40.730 --> 05:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
squaring that
 
05:23:45.650 --> 05:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
well I I think that you know as as we've
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
stated earlier
 
05:23:50.878 --> 05:23:51.890 align:start position:0%
stated earlier
um

05:23:51.890 --> 05:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's clear to us you know we've been
 
05:23:55.550 --> 05:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
here before this committee for a number
 
05:23:57.650 --> 05:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
of years now with a number of bills
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concern about
 
05:24:03.410 --> 05:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
how the current rules address or in some
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
views don't some people say don't
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
address citing criteria adequately and
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
so we believe that that certainly time
 
05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
has come where we're going to need to
 
05:24:16.010 --> 05:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
look at these citing criteria and and
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
Shore them up in some fashion that's
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to be acceptable to the general
 
05:24:22.970 --> 05:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
court and to the regulated community and
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
to the public and that's a delicate
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
balance but I think that you know the
 
05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
other bills that have been referenced uh
 
05:24:32.330 --> 05:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
by myself and by assistant commissioner
 
05:24:32.340 --> 05:24:34.128 align:start position:0%
by myself and by assistant commissioner
Sanborn

05:24:34.128 --> 05:24:34.138 align:start position:0%
Sanborn
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
provide a good outline of the criteria
 
05:24:39.708 --> 05:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at and give
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
some clear guidance on how to use those
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
criteria to develop citing more specific
 
05:24:46.610 --> 05:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
citing criteria particularly with
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
respect to surface water setbacks and I
 
05:24:51.650 --> 05:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
think that I think we think that that
 
05:24:53.930 --> 05:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
can work but we're here today to talk to
 
05:24:55.850 --> 05:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
you about these two bills and and I
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
think you've heard from our testimony
 
05:24:59.208 --> 05:24:59.218 align:start position:0%
that we think that they are in many
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
respects fraught with pitfalls that make
 
05:25:03.770 --> 05:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
them unsuitable
 
05:25:06.530 --> 05:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I'll just quickly add uh sticking to
 
05:25:07.850 --> 05:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:25:07.860 --> 05:25:08.990 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
we our goal is to have a coordinated
 
05:25:17.330 --> 05:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
effort to really
 
05:25:20.708 --> 05:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
look at these issues from
 
05:25:23.810 --> 05:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
utilizing and the reason we're utilizing
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
a we've thought about using a third
 
05:25:29.810 --> 05:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
party is because our staff if they all
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
they had to do was this they could get
 
05:25:36.470 --> 05:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
together and and and do this work we
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
just simply our staff similarly doesn't
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
have the time to dedicate to doing the
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
research and background and data
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
collection needed to give our our staff
 
05:25:52.368 --> 05:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
the right tools to come up with a
 
05:25:54.890 --> 05:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so that's why
 
05:25:57.770 --> 05:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and the approach we've talked about I
 
05:26:00.050 --> 05:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
I I think the key here is we're we're
 
05:26:02.810 --> 05:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
not disagreeing or agreeing with
 
05:26:05.448 --> 05:26:05.458 align:start position:0%
anyone's testimony what we're saying is
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
we would like a coordinated effort done
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
in a process driven way that gives us
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
all the information and all the data and
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
and analyzes our neighboring states so
 
05:26:22.850 --> 05:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
we aren't relying on just the testimony
 
05:26:26.510 --> 05:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect of individuals you
 
05:26:29.208 --> 05:26:29.218 align:start position:0%
know here in this room offering their
 
05:26:32.570 --> 05:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
perspective and we want to have a more
 
05:26:35.990 --> 05:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
coordinated holistic approach to looking
 
05:26:37.788 --> 05:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
at this and coming up with the right
 
05:26:39.850 --> 05:26:39.860 align:start position:0%
answer for the State of New Hampshire
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
not disregarding what other states are
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing but looking at all of it in a full
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
way and finding out what makes the most
 
05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
sense balancing all the needs of the
 
05:26:51.770 --> 05:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
state the environmental the natural
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
resources the economic
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
across the board and so those are the
 
05:27:00.170 --> 05:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
measures of what will be supporting and
 
05:27:01.970 --> 05:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
we think is the best path to moving
 
05:27:01.980 --> 05:27:03.890 align:start position:0%
we think is the best path to moving
forward

05:27:03.890 --> 05:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:27:06.288 --> 05:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:27:10.368 --> 05:27:10.378 align:start position:0%
representative Knapp
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wonder what
 
05:27:13.550 --> 05:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
you think the timeline of that would be
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
because we're hearing that we don't need
 
05:27:17.330 --> 05:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
a landfill for a long time we're also
 
05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
hearing that there's a landfill concern
 
05:27:20.690 --> 05:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
in the state I apologize that I'm new to
 
05:27:23.570 --> 05:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
this process but um you know it I I
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the points you make about
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
about getting the best rulemaking policy
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
in place but what is the time frame of
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
doing that when asked this questioned by
 
05:27:35.628 --> 05:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
others we have said we think two years
 
05:27:38.690 --> 05:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
um would be enough time to go through
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
the RFP process to select to allow
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
a firm a selected Consultants to do
 
05:27:49.850 --> 05:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
their work to analyze that work and then
 
05:27:54.170 --> 05:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
do the uh the regulatory rulemaking that
 
05:27:56.510 --> 05:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
would be required there would be overlap
 
05:27:59.448 --> 05:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
in that some would feed off each other
 
05:28:02.050 --> 05:28:02.060 align:start position:0%
um so it's if they're not completely
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
isolated activities there's some overlap
 
05:28:05.040 --> 05:28:05.930 align:start position:0%
isolated activities there's some overlap
but

05:28:05.930 --> 05:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:28:08.150 --> 05:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
um what we've stated is we think two
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
years is while aggressive I do time
 
05:28:14.090 --> 05:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
frame for us to go through that process
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:25.850 --> 05:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
the 602 has been effective and working
 
05:28:28.368 --> 05:28:28.378 align:start position:0%
well for 30 years in Maine doesn't that
 
05:28:30.650 --> 05:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
sort of give you a jump start on the
 
05:28:33.230 --> 05:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
process and and that's I have one a
 
05:28:34.730 --> 05:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
second question to follow up on that and
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
that is that if we were to pass this
 
05:28:39.170 --> 05:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
bill could it be a guideline for you
 
05:28:42.650 --> 05:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
setting rules around the details that
 
05:28:45.650 --> 05:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
that you feel May differ
 
05:28:48.708 --> 05:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
I I guess um
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to pass it's more than
 
05:28:52.850 --> 05:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
a guideline it's the law and we would
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
incorporate and admin and develop and
 
05:28:59.448 --> 05:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
adopt rules that were completely aligned
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
with the law and that's that's the
 
05:29:04.250 --> 05:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
problem the guidelines we can but that's
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
not what what these bills are these are
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
these become law
 
05:29:09.948 --> 05:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
05:29:14.208 --> 05:29:14.218 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question if
 
05:29:17.690 --> 05:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh we were to amend this in some way as
 
05:29:20.810 --> 05:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
to make it a pro a a process to a
 
05:29:23.690 --> 05:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
development process for rulemaking
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
um as you suggested you're interested in
 
05:29:28.610 --> 05:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
would do you feel that would make sense
 
05:29:31.550 --> 05:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
to have a moratorium on any new
 
05:29:34.128 --> 05:29:34.138 align:start position:0%
permitting of landfills until that
 
05:29:36.288 --> 05:29:36.298 align:start position:0%
process was completed
 
05:29:36.298 --> 05:29:37.910 align:start position:0%
process was completed
so

05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
um just the director's always in a tough
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
position because uh Mike being directly
 
05:29:47.208 --> 05:29:47.218 align:start position:0%
involved with approval has to be very
 
05:29:49.010 --> 05:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
careful about speaking especially that
 
05:29:51.288 --> 05:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
specific so I'll take care of that
 
05:29:51.298 --> 05:29:52.910 align:start position:0%
specific so I'll take care of that
answer

05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
um uh we our policy position is we are
 
05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
going to be neutral on the concept of a
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
moratorium we'll respect what
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
um the lawmakers and ultimately if the
 
05:30:08.208 --> 05:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
governor agrees comes up with on that
 
05:30:12.530 --> 05:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I I will say this I I think
 
05:30:13.930 --> 05:30:13.940 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
any of these legislation could be
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
crafted in a way where
 
05:30:20.930 --> 05:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
um we would be able to do the work we
 
05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
05:30:25.430 --> 05:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and and that time would would allow
 
05:30:25.440 --> 05:30:28.010 align:start position:0%
um and and that time would would allow
for

05:30:28.010 --> 05:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
um uh any future sites to to uh be be
 
05:30:32.638 --> 05:30:34.250 align:start position:0%
um uh any future sites to to uh be be
regulated

05:30:34.250 --> 05:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
05:30:36.050 --> 05:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
um and just one note though because you
 
05:30:37.850 --> 05:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
talk about amending I do want to be
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
transparent and clear
 
05:30:42.770 --> 05:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
the starting point for this
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
um this legislation has written is
 
05:30:47.208 --> 05:30:47.218 align:start position:0%
pretty far away from the approach we're
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
taking the the key to the approach we're
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
supporting is no prescription of what
 
05:30:58.368 --> 05:30:58.378 align:start position:0%
the rules should look like before and
 
05:31:01.850 --> 05:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
passed in statute but allowing but
 
05:31:03.970 --> 05:31:03.980 align:start position:0%
giving us the tools and the time frame
 
05:31:07.610 --> 05:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
to to bring forward rules that we think
 
05:31:09.708 --> 05:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
are based on
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
um data and
 
05:31:14.690 --> 05:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
um other examples
 
05:31:17.448 --> 05:31:17.458 align:start position:0%
um you know and and that's how we would
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
develop our rulemaking I you know I've
 
05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
heard the term use the main is working
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
well that's a subjective term it and
 
05:31:28.730 --> 05:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
what are you balancing what policy
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
impacts are you balancing are you saying
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
just the environmental are you saying
 
05:31:35.690 --> 05:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
the economic impact or you know the the
 
05:31:38.690 --> 05:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
cost to the residents depending on what
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
availability so we I can't sit here and
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
tell you any of these things are or
 
05:31:47.208 --> 05:31:47.218 align:start position:0%
aren't working well what I can tell you
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
is if if we're given the chance to to
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
work with a third party and find out
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
that information we will only do a
 
05:31:57.350 --> 05:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
better job coming up with rulemaking
 
05:31:58.850 --> 05:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
that makes sense for the State of New
 
05:31:58.860 --> 05:32:02.628 align:start position:0%
that makes sense for the State of New
Hampshire

05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:05.090 --> 05:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
05:32:10.310 --> 05:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:10.320 --> 05:32:13.730 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:32:13.730 --> 05:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
sources to do some of this stuff
 
05:32:16.798 --> 05:32:18.410 align:start position:0%
sources to do some of this stuff
adequately

05:32:18.410 --> 05:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the best of your ability and I guess
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
so the follow-up question I have on that
 
05:32:25.310 --> 05:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
is how long would you say it has been
 
05:32:27.170 --> 05:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
since you have adequately had enough
 
05:32:29.868 --> 05:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
resources to do this work
 
05:32:31.610 --> 05:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
well well
 
05:32:33.770 --> 05:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation at budget time
 
05:32:37.610 --> 05:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh but um at least when I was referring
 
05:32:40.250 --> 05:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
to resources that wasn't an advocacy of
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
we need more Personnel that that's not
 
05:32:44.208 --> 05:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
the point I'm making the point I'm
 
05:32:44.218 --> 05:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
the point I'm making the point I'm
making

05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
um in order to do this the right way it
 
05:32:52.010 --> 05:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
would require staff to completely focus
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
on this and not be able to focus on
 
05:32:56.448 --> 05:32:56.458 align:start position:0%
their existing regulatory
 
05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so I I did this what
 
05:33:06.530 --> 05:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to do is is is is to
 
05:33:09.708 --> 05:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
gather information gather data and do
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
some analysis on it and it's a very
 
05:33:16.730 --> 05:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
intense time-intensive project and
 
05:33:19.730 --> 05:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
um and and that's why we we talked about
 
05:33:22.730 --> 05:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
the idea of this is a great example of
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
where government can look for outside
 
05:33:28.550 --> 05:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
help to do a very specific time-driven
 
05:33:28.560 --> 05:33:29.990 align:start position:0%
help to do a very specific time-driven
task

05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
task
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
um focused on that well we continue to
 
05:33:34.970 --> 05:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
do our work provide the information and
 
05:33:37.368 --> 05:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
then we can incorporate it in rules that
 
05:33:40.610 --> 05:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
we think will end up where we all want
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be balancing all our policy impacts
 
05:33:46.430 --> 05:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to balance natural
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
resources environment economic quality
 
05:33:50.890 --> 05:33:50.900 align:start position:0%
of life
 
05:33:55.070 --> 05:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
costs to our residents
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative datsey
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair so
 
05:34:04.010 --> 05:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I need clarification so if if this
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
goes forward and you are able to hire a
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
third party okay is legislation going to
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
come out of that that we would then vote
 
05:34:17.448 --> 05:34:17.458 align:start position:0%
on or are you saying that the end result
 
05:34:21.170 --> 05:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
of this third party is rulemaking and
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature would basically be cut
 
05:34:25.970 --> 05:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
off oh I want to be careful of the
 
05:34:28.490 --> 05:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
chairs rule about how we talk so I'll
 
05:34:30.050 --> 05:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
talk about it more generically than
 
05:34:33.110 --> 05:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
specifically uh generically speaking the
 
05:34:34.930 --> 05:34:34.940 align:start position:0%
approach would be
 
05:34:37.850 --> 05:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
directing us to do a study with
 
05:34:40.730 --> 05:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
guidelines and directing us to then use
 
05:34:42.770 --> 05:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
that study for rulemaking with some
 
05:34:45.770 --> 05:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
guidelines so it would lead us to the
 
05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
whole process would lead us to do rule
 
05:34:49.490 --> 05:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
making based on guidelines that are in
 
05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Dotsy just to clarify
 
05:34:55.610 --> 05:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
there would be no legislation coming
 
05:34:57.708 --> 05:34:57.718 align:start position:0%
forward for the process that you're
 
05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
talking about no there there are there
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
are ways to approach legislation that
 
05:35:02.638 --> 05:35:03.650 align:start position:0%
are ways to approach legislation that
would

05:35:03.650 --> 05:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:35:06.530 --> 05:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
um direct us to conduct the study with
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
some funding and then um rule making
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
with some broad guidelines of the areas
 
05:35:14.810 --> 05:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
of the rule making we would want that
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
the state would want us to be addressing
 
05:35:20.330 --> 05:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
and then uh we would then over about a
 
05:35:22.250 --> 05:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
two-year period
 
05:35:24.770 --> 05:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
um conduct those activities
 
05:35:27.050 --> 05:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and have the data we need and the
 
05:35:30.050 --> 05:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
background we need to do uh bring
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
forward or rule making that as Des staff
 
05:35:35.230 --> 05:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
we feel would we feel comfortable
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
represents all the interests of the
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:35:44.208 --> 05:35:44.218 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:35:44.218 --> 05:35:44.930 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:35:44.930 --> 05:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:47.930 --> 05:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
on the same topic uh just listening to
 
05:35:50.330 --> 05:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
things and I just want to for a point of
 
05:35:53.230 --> 05:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
clarification it is my understanding
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
that what we pulled here in 602 from
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
Maine is not actually in statute but in
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
their rules is that correct
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
I don't pretend to be an expert on that
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'll hand it over to the director I
 
05:36:09.050 --> 05:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
don't have a definitive answer on that
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding there may be
 
05:36:12.650 --> 05:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
components that occur in both places but
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
I believe much of what is in this occurs
 
05:36:18.288 --> 05:36:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:27.288 --> 05:36:27.298 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen so we have a conundrum we
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
have scientists who make
 
05:36:34.670 --> 05:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
um a good case for both sides
 
05:36:34.680 --> 05:36:36.110 align:start position:0%
um a good case for both sides
and

05:36:36.110 --> 05:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:38.690 --> 05:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
you have a different responsibility than
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:36:42.770 --> 05:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
but in the back of my mind
 
05:36:45.890 --> 05:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
are the people who are waiting for the
 
05:36:48.890 --> 05:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to help them with a problem
 
05:36:50.990 --> 05:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
that cannot wait
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I live on the Seacoast so I have
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
some experience of a 20-year fight with
 
05:36:57.600 --> 05:37:00.170 align:start position:0%
some experience of a 20-year fight with
regulators

05:37:00.170 --> 05:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
regulators
 
05:37:03.410 --> 05:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I just
 
05:37:06.590 --> 05:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we can both appreciate this
 
05:37:06.600 --> 05:37:08.510 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we can both appreciate this
conundrum

05:37:08.510 --> 05:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
conundrum
 
05:37:11.208 --> 05:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
we have different responsibilities
 
05:37:15.170 --> 05:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
and with respect at the end of the day
 
05:37:17.810 --> 05:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
we meet we discuss and we come to a
 
05:37:17.820 --> 05:37:19.730 align:start position:0%
we meet we discuss and we come to a
consensus

05:37:19.730 --> 05:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
05:37:19.740 --> 05:37:20.690 align:start position:0%
consensus
um

05:37:20.690 --> 05:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:23.690 --> 05:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
and we will do that with ethical
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
considerations as well as our
 
05:37:31.010 --> 05:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
particular scientific knowledge however
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
meager it may be but I um
 
05:37:39.050 --> 05:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
I just want you to appreciate that
 
05:37:43.128 --> 05:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
um we recognize expert testimony is what
 
05:37:46.250 --> 05:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
we need to make these decisions but when
 
05:37:49.850 --> 05:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
it conflicts we do our best to sort it
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
out and make a good decision does that
 
05:37:54.288 --> 05:37:54.298 align:start position:0%
make sense yeah let me yeah let me
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
answer this way
 
05:37:56.878 --> 05:37:58.730 align:start position:0%
answer this way
um

05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:03.410 --> 05:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
we too want to see something passed and
 
05:38:05.570 --> 05:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
have Direction
 
05:38:05.580 --> 05:38:06.670 align:start position:0%
have Direction
um

05:38:06.670 --> 05:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:06.680 --> 05:38:08.448 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:38:08.448 --> 05:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:08.458 --> 05:38:09.170 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:38:09.170 --> 05:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:11.810 --> 05:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
without being overly specific I'll I'll
 
05:38:13.490 --> 05:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
tell you this much
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
during the break between the last
 
05:38:18.410 --> 05:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
session and this session we talked to a
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
lot of folks about something that could
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
have the support of the legislative both
 
05:38:26.810 --> 05:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
Chambers and
 
05:38:30.288 --> 05:38:30.298 align:start position:0%
um you know the governor's office so
 
05:38:30.298 --> 05:38:31.610 align:start position:0%
um you know the governor's office so
um

05:38:31.610 --> 05:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:34.368 --> 05:38:34.378 align:start position:0%
we are recommending both what we feel is
 
05:38:36.670 --> 05:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
the best approach for Des
 
05:38:40.250 --> 05:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
and our role and
 
05:38:43.550 --> 05:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
um based on what we think is going to be
 
05:38:46.490 --> 05:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
powerful enough to enough folks that we
 
05:38:49.250 --> 05:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
could actually move forward with
 
05:38:51.230 --> 05:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
something and not just continue to
 
05:38:54.350 --> 05:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
debate because to your point
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
folks coming forward with their
 
05:39:01.610 --> 05:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
prescripted idea hasn't resulted in any
 
05:39:04.490 --> 05:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
actual movement on this issue over years
 
05:39:08.270 --> 05:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
now so the time that would result from
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
the process where
 
05:39:14.270 --> 05:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
um we're suggesting is still less time
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
than it would take if nothing passes and
 
05:39:18.910 --> 05:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
there are more years of fight
 
05:39:21.770 --> 05:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
legislatively representative Murray
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and with all due
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
respect I just
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
would like to just make the point I
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
guess with regard to representative
 
05:39:32.510 --> 05:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
Haskins statement that we do have a very
 
05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
specific charge within this committee
 
05:39:37.970 --> 05:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
and part of that is dealing with air and
 
05:39:39.530 --> 05:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
water pollution waste management and
 
05:39:41.810 --> 05:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
other other issues that come before us
 
05:39:44.330 --> 05:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
so to that end I do think we have an
 
05:39:46.850 --> 05:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
obligation to get it right and we've had
 
05:39:48.230 --> 05:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
a multitude of
 
05:39:50.570 --> 05:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
people coming from many different
 
05:39:53.690 --> 05:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
perspectives here before us seeking an
 
05:39:53.700 --> 05:39:54.530 align:start position:0%
perspectives here before us seeking an
answer

05:39:54.530 --> 05:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
So to that end I I would hope that we
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to sit
 
05:40:02.448 --> 05:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
and work those through in a way that
 
05:40:02.458 --> 05:40:04.030 align:start position:0%
and work those through in a way that
would

05:40:04.030 --> 05:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
arrive at an answer that may be more
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
amenable we will always work with all of
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
the state's elected officials and and
 
05:40:14.930 --> 05:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
the general court
 
05:40:17.570 --> 05:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
um as you speak of your role all I can
 
05:40:20.470 --> 05:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
tell you is I can only be here in viral
 
05:40:24.410 --> 05:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
and in the in our role
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
um within Des as the folks being asked
 
05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
to implement whatever is passed what
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're bringing forward is what we
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
believe is in the best interest of the
 
05:40:38.510 --> 05:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
state and in the best interest of what
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
we feel would lead to the best result
 
05:40:44.570 --> 05:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
um as the folks at the es who are going
 
05:40:49.368 --> 05:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
to be implementing it and we feel there
 
05:40:52.490 --> 05:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
is we need more information more data
 
05:40:56.170 --> 05:40:56.180 align:start position:0%
and a more process different driven
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
approach to this versus one-off
 
05:41:01.610 --> 05:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
individual recommendations
 
05:41:05.030 --> 05:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are from folks passionate folks I'm
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
not judging them either way on their
 
05:41:09.730 --> 05:41:09.740 align:start position:0%
intellect their
 
05:41:13.310 --> 05:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
experiences their engineering scientific
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
knowledge I'm I'm saying uh usually in
 
05:41:23.090 --> 05:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
in government when you use a process it
 
05:41:27.890 --> 05:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
is better than using one-off testimony
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
to make a decision and
 
05:41:32.690 --> 05:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
um so all I can do as assistant
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of of Des is bring forward
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
what we think is in the best interest
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of the department
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative but we will
 
05:41:44.890 --> 05:41:44.900 align:start position:0%
always work with the the general court
 
05:41:47.810 --> 05:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
and of course whatever the general court
 
05:41:49.970 --> 05:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
ends up passing and if it's signed into
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
law by the governor we would of course
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
follow whatever on the state's due the
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
elected officials direct us to do thank
 
05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
you representative German I had a
 
05:42:01.490 --> 05:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair uh I
 
05:42:03.650 --> 05:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
want to get at something that's at least
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
been a subtext here which is the
 
05:42:08.570 --> 05:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
difference between statute and Rule and
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
the the different roles of Statute
 
05:42:13.368 --> 05:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
versus versus a rule and you'd made a
 
05:42:16.128 --> 05:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
comment a few minutes ago about what you
 
05:42:17.690 --> 05:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
would like to see or a set of guidelines
 
05:42:20.090 --> 05:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
which allow you to make rules that you
 
05:42:22.490 --> 05:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
believe balance say environmental
 
05:42:24.890 --> 05:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
interests economic interests of the
 
05:42:27.410 --> 05:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
state but my question to you is isn't it
 
05:42:30.890 --> 05:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
our job to decide what that balance is
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
between the the environmental and
 
05:42:35.448 --> 05:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
economic interests of the state as
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
literally as as Representatives uh so
 
05:42:39.770 --> 05:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
here he's saying and the reason why I
 
05:42:41.208 --> 05:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
raised that question again is to
 
05:42:43.310 --> 05:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
highlight why perhaps something should
 
05:42:46.368 --> 05:42:46.378 align:start position:0%
be in statute as opposed to develop as a
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
rule because if it if it involves those
 
05:42:51.128 --> 05:42:51.138 align:start position:0%
questions aren't those questions
 
05:42:53.448 --> 05:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
precisely the ones that should be
 
05:42:56.090 --> 05:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
decided by elected representatives and
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
then rules based upon the decisions that
 
05:43:01.490 --> 05:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
that are then made I'll answer that this
 
05:43:06.410 --> 05:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
way if the legislature feels they have
 
05:43:08.810 --> 05:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
the right answer and the right approach
 
05:43:12.110 --> 05:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
to this issue and pass that in statute
 
05:43:14.930 --> 05:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
and the governor signs that we'll follow
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
that of course yes you are the 424
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
members of the general court a governor
 
05:43:22.970 --> 05:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
and we have those five executive
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
counselors that every two weeks approve
 
05:43:28.430 --> 05:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
our contract so uh the 430 folks are
 
05:43:28.440 --> 05:43:30.110 align:start position:0%
our contract so uh the 430 folks are
certainly

05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the the folks who directly are
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
directly sent by the people and and are
 
05:43:38.930 --> 05:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
the policy makers of the state
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
um what I was referring to is
 
05:43:41.760 --> 05:43:44.330 align:start position:0%
um what I was referring to is
we

05:43:44.330 --> 05:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:43:46.850 --> 05:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
if asked what we feel
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
is in the best approach what we feel we
 
05:43:52.610 --> 05:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
can do given the tools we have what
 
05:43:55.730 --> 05:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
we're saying is we think more
 
05:44:00.048 --> 05:44:00.058 align:start position:0%
information is needed in a defined
 
05:44:03.530 --> 05:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
process will result in a better that's
 
05:44:05.330 --> 05:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
our recommendation of what we think
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
would turn out the best result but what
 
05:44:11.510 --> 05:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
you are if you all feel comfortable and
 
05:44:14.090 --> 05:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
enough folks in both in both Chambers
 
05:44:16.208 --> 05:44:16.218 align:start position:0%
feel that way and the governor agrees
 
05:44:18.770 --> 05:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
that'll be the answer of course
 
05:44:20.208 --> 05:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
05:44:30.770 --> 05:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
table legislation for two years and wait
 
05:44:34.850 --> 05:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
for you to come back to us with the with
 
05:44:37.570 --> 05:44:37.580 align:start position:0%
the results of this consultant process
 
05:44:40.750 --> 05:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
again I'll answer this generically
 
05:44:43.850 --> 05:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
legislation could be done so that it
 
05:44:46.970 --> 05:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
agains it outlines what's in the study
 
05:44:50.628 --> 05:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
and then it outlines the parameters of
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
what should be included in rule making
 
05:44:55.250 --> 05:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
and directing us and we would move
 
05:44:56.810 --> 05:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
forward with rulemaking and the
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
legislature still has the ability if
 
05:45:01.730 --> 05:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
they don't like what we come up with
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
um to pass legislation directing us
 
05:45:06.530 --> 05:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
um to change those rules as the
 
05:45:08.570 --> 05:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
legislature sees fit so there's still
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity for the states
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
elected officials to to weigh in at that
 
05:45:13.798 --> 05:45:14.750 align:start position:0%
elected officials to to weigh in at that
point

05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:45:17.048 --> 05:45:17.058 align:start position:0%
um if if there's consensus
 
05:45:19.730 --> 05:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
something in how we went about it wasn't
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't done the right way and needs to
 
05:45:25.010 --> 05:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:27.770 --> 05:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:45:30.288 --> 05:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and I'd
 
05:45:31.850 --> 05:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
like to call Cynthia wall thank you
 
05:45:34.010 --> 05:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee yep like to
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
call Cynthia Walter
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.810 --> 05:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me again today
 
05:45:51.708 --> 05:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
um I it was wonderful to hear all of
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
this discussion all day long and
 
05:45:58.010 --> 05:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
I am speaking now as somebody who has
 
05:46:01.850 --> 05:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
worked with the uh folks similar to the
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
Des we call them in Pennsylvania the dep
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
for uh over 20 years
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
and working with those uh of folks and
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
also other Professional Engineers
 
05:46:17.690 --> 05:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
I have a chance to see firsthand
 
05:46:23.448 --> 05:46:23.458 align:start position:0%
the importance of clear guidelines four
 
05:46:26.570 --> 05:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
regulations that came from statute down
 
05:46:29.930 --> 05:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
to regulations through a messy process I
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
agree but then we're enacted I've also
 
05:46:37.010 --> 05:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
had the chance to see how engineers in
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing would make
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
terrific mistakes and I see that coming
 
05:46:43.200 --> 05:46:44.690 align:start position:0%
terrific mistakes and I see that coming
through

05:46:44.690 --> 05:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:46:47.410 --> 05:46:47.420 align:start position:0%
um in ways of correcting
 
05:46:50.208 --> 05:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
mistakes that can easily happen
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 602
 
05:46:56.930 --> 05:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I see the strength of the Simplicity
 
05:47:00.770 --> 05:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
of 56. I see the strength of the details
 
05:47:02.330 --> 05:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
in 602
 
05:47:06.288 --> 05:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the humility of the Des
 
05:47:07.788 --> 05:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
to say
 
05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
flat out what I heard today is they do
 
05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
not yet know how to safely cite
 
05:47:15.600 --> 05:47:17.448 align:start position:0%
not yet know how to safely cite
landfills

05:47:17.448 --> 05:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:47:19.250 --> 05:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
and they need two years to figure it out
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
I also heard them say that they need
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
just like the dep folks that I worked
 
05:47:31.010 --> 05:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
with they need principles and guidelines
 
05:47:34.190 --> 05:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
from you that are important what do I
 
05:47:37.788 --> 05:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
see in 602 and 56 and perhaps other
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
things I see that there's a need for a
 
05:47:47.030 --> 05:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
100 Year protective framework
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
whether you get it from the one you know
 
05:47:52.250 --> 05:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
the velocity of this and that whether
 
05:47:54.410 --> 05:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
you get it from an assessment of soils
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
however you get it
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
100 Year protective
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
the attention to sensitive receptors
 
05:48:07.250 --> 05:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
cannot be underestimated it has to be in
 
05:48:10.730 --> 05:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
a revision of either 56 602 whatever no
 
05:48:12.288 --> 05:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
new number you give it
 
05:48:14.570 --> 05:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
it needs to be there and here's why
 
05:48:16.368 --> 05:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as you heard one of the
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
other testimonies today
 
05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
we have an abundance of running fresh
 
05:48:25.730 --> 05:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
water surface waters we also have an
 
05:48:27.708 --> 05:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
abundance of important groundwater
 
05:48:29.628 --> 05:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
supplies for public water for public
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
05:48:34.490 --> 05:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
that combination in the United States
 
05:48:37.490 --> 05:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
that combination in the world
 
05:48:40.310 --> 05:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
is extraordinary
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
running surface water is the rarest of
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
the rare Waters in the world and you
 
05:48:47.990 --> 05:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
have in a New Hampshire has an abundance
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
of that you must protect those rare
 
05:48:54.048 --> 05:48:54.058 align:start position:0%
surface waters you have an abundance of
 
05:48:57.470 --> 05:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
drinkable groundwater
 
05:49:00.288 --> 05:49:00.298 align:start position:0%
that is I mean I've been in continents
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
around the world and it is so rare to
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
have drinkable groundwater folks I just
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
just amazing so you have to collect
 
05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
everything in between and therefore that
 
05:49:17.030 --> 05:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
100 year and the sensitive receptors has
 
05:49:19.490 --> 05:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
to be in the new guidelines and then
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's the Practical setbacks
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how many times we have
 
05:49:28.128 --> 05:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
had Engineers who said no we can do this
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
and there we're standing in 500 gallons
 
05:49:35.448 --> 05:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
a minute discharges flooding ourselves
 
05:49:38.690 --> 05:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
up to our waists my hip my hip waders
 
05:49:41.170 --> 05:49:41.180 align:start position:0%
were not sufficient
 
05:49:44.530 --> 05:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
we never know what is going to happen to
 
05:49:47.270 --> 05:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
discharges of contaminated water and
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
where they'll end up this one with these
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
300 foot and and 1 000 foot setbacks
 
05:49:53.930 --> 05:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
between this property and that property
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
it allows you to do what we oftentimes
 
05:49:59.628 --> 05:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't do in Pennsylvania is put in a
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
remediation really fast to get to handle
 
05:50:05.230 --> 05:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
that 500 gallons a minute
 
05:50:07.368 --> 05:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
unexpected discharge that the engineers
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
said wouldn't be there but they were
 
05:50:12.128 --> 05:50:12.138 align:start position:0%
humble just like the the Des is humble
 
05:50:16.208 --> 05:50:16.218 align:start position:0%
so I strongly encourage you
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
to take the people who sponsored 56 and
 
05:50:22.850 --> 05:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
602 craft
 
05:50:26.090 --> 05:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
a legislation that gives the Des
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
the money and the time two years to
 
05:50:29.280 --> 05:50:31.070 align:start position:0%
the money and the time two years to
create

05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
a new set of laws with the statute that
 
05:50:39.410 --> 05:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
you design that says those things that
 
05:50:42.470 --> 05:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
we can have to keep and save the baby
 
05:50:46.850 --> 05:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
and the bath water no pun intended
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your excuse me thank you
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony oh I'm sorry
 
05:50:56.810 --> 05:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray and
 
05:50:58.368 --> 05:50:58.378 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins can you shut your
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
microphone off thank you
 
05:51:02.628 --> 05:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
I did just have one clarifying Point
 
05:51:04.670 --> 05:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
were you asking for the date to be
 
05:51:07.128 --> 05:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
enacted two years from the time of the
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
legislation being crapped I just want to
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
be clear about what you were no no what
 
05:51:12.590 --> 05:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
I meant was well I don't I'm just gonna
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
give them
 
05:51:16.490 --> 05:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
what they estimated was two years so
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
again I can't I'm not good at rewriting
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
laws I'm only good at you know doing
 
05:51:24.288 --> 05:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
data so
 
05:51:26.690 --> 05:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how you
 
05:51:29.690 --> 05:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
how you would craft the statute that
 
05:51:29.700 --> 05:51:30.650 align:start position:0%
how you would craft the statute that
says

05:51:30.650 --> 05:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:51:34.250 --> 05:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
these the guidelines for developing
 
05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
rules that will provide 100
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
that have that will have rules that will
 
05:51:42.830 --> 05:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
have a 100 Year protective framework
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
that would have this and that and that
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
you put a time limit on it so they're
 
05:51:49.548 --> 05:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
not going to drift forever in developing
 
05:51:52.730 --> 05:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
those rules because it's true there's
 
05:51:54.770 --> 05:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
nobody knocking on our door right now in
 
05:51:56.750 --> 05:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
terms of landfill citing but that
 
05:51:58.010 --> 05:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that somebody won't be
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
arriving soon for some reason
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant she just suggestion
 
05:52:05.570 --> 05:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
put some limit on it that's all
 
05:52:09.470 --> 05:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
05:52:11.570 --> 05:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:13.128 --> 05:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
05:52:15.288 --> 05:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to Now call uh
 
05:52:24.048 --> 05:52:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:25.970 --> 05:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
05:52:28.310 --> 05:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is David Rochford
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm from Littleton representing Grafton
 
05:52:32.390 --> 05:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
one with representative Simon I'd
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
prepared some remarks but I think it's
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
late and we've heard a lot of this stuff
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
over and over again I'm going to kind of
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
dispose with that for everyone's sake
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
what I was going to talk about is is uh
 
05:52:45.470 --> 05:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
money and resources and tourism and and
 
05:52:47.330 --> 05:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
all the wonderful things that bring
 
05:52:49.788 --> 05:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
people to New Hampshire but I wanted to
 
05:52:51.770 --> 05:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
address a couple things I think Dr
 
05:52:55.368 --> 05:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
representative ducci asked uh how about
 
05:52:57.470 --> 05:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
some of the co-sponsors and I'm
 
05:53:00.650 --> 05:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring 602 and quite frankly I
 
05:53:05.830 --> 05:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
would be happy to co-sponsor 56 as well
 
05:53:09.170 --> 05:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
we our family bought a house on a lake
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh in 2017 and it was an old house as a
 
05:53:13.680 --> 05:53:14.990 align:start position:0%
uh in 2017 and it was an old house as a
camp

05:53:14.990 --> 05:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
camp
 
05:53:19.250 --> 05:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
um and we what we didn't know we were
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
buying was an environmental time bomb
 
05:53:26.570 --> 05:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
we bought a house that was about 100
 
05:53:29.090 --> 05:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
years old and about the time the house
 
05:53:31.930 --> 05:53:31.940 align:start position:0%
was built all the land around this house
 
05:53:34.368 --> 05:53:34.378 align:start position:0%
was farmland
 
05:53:37.850 --> 05:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
sheep farming and cattle farming and
 
05:53:39.850 --> 05:53:39.860 align:start position:0%
going back about a hundred years ago
 
05:53:42.830 --> 05:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
even when it was deforested but that's a
 
05:53:44.330 --> 05:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
whole other story
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
um you know there was there was unknown
 
05:53:47.448 --> 05:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
what what
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
chronic fertilization uh animal waste
 
05:53:53.030 --> 05:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
things like that would do but what
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
happened fast forward to 2017 and what
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
we know now is there's something called
 
05:54:01.730 --> 05:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
gravity everything flows downhill and
 
05:54:04.810 --> 05:54:04.820 align:start position:0%
our case was not landfill related it was
 
05:54:07.750 --> 05:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria related and I'm I'm I'm
 
05:54:10.368 --> 05:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
gonna get off topic a little bit but I
 
05:54:12.288 --> 05:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
promise I'll get back on topic if you'll
 
05:54:14.030 --> 05:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
entertain me
 
05:54:14.040 --> 05:54:14.628 align:start position:0%
entertain me
um

05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:18.350 --> 05:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
and what we realized or what we we found
 
05:54:21.410 --> 05:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
out was that little bit of phosphorus
 
05:54:23.330 --> 05:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
that flowed downhill was just enough to
 
05:54:26.750 --> 05:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
tip the the the Eco system of the lake
 
05:54:31.070 --> 05:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
to a situation that caused a bacteria
 
05:54:33.530 --> 05:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
Bloom so when representative Simon asked
 
05:54:35.030 --> 05:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
me if I want to sign on to this he knew
 
05:54:36.530 --> 05:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
about our situation the lake is in
 
05:54:39.530 --> 05:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
Littleton uh it's Partridge Lake I said
 
05:54:42.170 --> 05:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely because we need to if we can
 
05:54:42.180 --> 05:54:43.548 align:start position:0%
absolutely because we need to if we can
take

05:54:43.548 --> 05:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:54:46.730 --> 05:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
action now to prevent something in the
 
05:54:46.740 --> 05:54:47.690 align:start position:0%
action now to prevent something in the
future

05:54:47.690 --> 05:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
we will protect everyone's property and
 
05:54:52.730 --> 05:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
property rights who are Downstream
 
05:54:55.010 --> 05:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
now I'm not going to be able to answer
 
05:54:58.970 --> 05:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
any questions about science I am a
 
05:55:01.010 --> 05:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
Scientist by by profession I'm not an
 
05:55:04.610 --> 05:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
engineer uh I'm not a hydrologist I
 
05:55:05.810 --> 05:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
don't even really know what that is
 
05:55:08.230 --> 05:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
probably studying water or a geologist
 
05:55:10.910 --> 05:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a pharmacist
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
in my profession
 
05:55:15.350 --> 05:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
100 years ago
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
we use leeches and lobotomies
 
05:55:22.128 --> 05:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
to treat headaches PMS
 
05:55:24.530 --> 05:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression aches and pains
 
05:55:26.810 --> 05:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
and infections
 
05:55:29.390 --> 05:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
and we realize that there's a better way
 
05:55:30.890 --> 05:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
to treat people
 
05:55:34.010 --> 05:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
and there's a better way to to to take
 
05:55:35.930 --> 05:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
care of people
 
05:55:39.470 --> 05:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm convinced that whether we go
 
05:55:42.530 --> 05:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
with 56 602 a combination there's a
 
05:55:45.650 --> 05:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
better way to do what we're doing than
 
05:55:48.048 --> 05:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
the way we're doing it now
 
05:55:50.750 --> 05:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your question how
 
05:55:52.910 --> 05:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
I got onto this I'm not I'm not an
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
environmental background guy
 
05:55:55.680 --> 05:55:56.570 align:start position:0%
environmental background guy
um

05:55:56.570 --> 05:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:58.250 --> 05:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I probably should be
 
05:56:02.690 --> 05:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
better at recycling but but uh I I I've
 
05:56:05.628 --> 05:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
experienced the ramifications of things
 
05:56:08.270 --> 05:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
that happened decades ago
 
05:56:08.280 --> 05:56:09.890 align:start position:0%
that happened decades ago
so

05:56:09.890 --> 05:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:12.650 --> 05:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
looking at these these these bills they
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
use modern accepted techniques they've
 
05:56:15.890 --> 05:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
been around for other states we're not
 
05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
reinvented we're not inventing the wheel
 
05:56:20.570 --> 05:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
with that this is not an anti-business
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
Bill if it was you'd I'd be the last one
 
05:56:24.470 --> 05:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
to sign on to this
 
05:56:27.170 --> 05:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a it it's actually in
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion a pro development bill in
 
05:56:31.910 --> 05:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
that it it encourages smart development
 
05:56:35.048 --> 05:56:35.058 align:start position:0%
and sustainable development it's not
 
05:56:37.368 --> 05:56:37.378 align:start position:0%
anti-landfill like I said we all have to
 
05:56:39.250 --> 05:56:39.260 align:start position:0%
throw stuff away
 
05:56:42.110 --> 05:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's just making sure the stuff that we
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
throw away today doesn't come back and
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
hurt us 50 years down the road that's
 
05:56:52.730 --> 05:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
happened to our family so again I
 
05:56:54.890 --> 05:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me
 
05:56:57.170 --> 05:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I I do hope something comes of this
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
it is an important issue uh and I
 
05:57:03.410 --> 05:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you thank you
 
05:57:06.288 --> 05:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
for your testimony any questions
 
05:57:08.330 --> 05:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you and I
 
05:57:11.150 --> 05:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
would like to Now call Tom Tower and
 
05:57:22.490 --> 05:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.548 --> 05:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
and I know that it's been
 
05:57:27.770 --> 05:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
a very long day
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it's obviously a very passionate
 
05:57:32.330 --> 05:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
subject so I'd like to take just a
 
05:57:34.610 --> 05:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
minute and I'll go off script as well to
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
speak about the history
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
so that people have perspective there's
 
05:57:40.910 --> 05:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of new faces here on on this
 
05:57:44.030 --> 05:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee and the conundrum that you
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
spoke about
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh so for the record my name is is Tom
 
05:57:48.958 --> 05:57:50.090 align:start position:0%
uh so for the record my name is is Tom
Tower

05:57:50.090 --> 05:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
Tower
 
05:57:52.548 --> 05:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
and I serve as the vice president of
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
North Country Alliance for balance
 
05:57:54.718 --> 05:57:55.850 align:start position:0%
North Country Alliance for balance
change

05:57:55.850 --> 05:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:57:58.190 --> 05:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'd first like to thank representative
 
05:58:00.470 --> 05:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
Simon and representative rocherford
 
05:58:01.730 --> 05:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Moody representative
 
05:58:01.740 --> 05:58:02.690 align:start position:0%
representative Moody representative
wrong

05:58:02.690 --> 05:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
for submitting 602
 
05:58:08.690 --> 05:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
and for being champions for clean water
 
05:58:11.090 --> 05:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
and uh in the great state of New
 
05:58:11.100 --> 05:58:13.010 align:start position:0%
and uh in the great state of New
Hampshire

05:58:13.010 --> 05:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:58:13.020 --> 05:58:15.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
we're not going to debate any more about
 
05:58:19.368 --> 05:58:19.378 align:start position:0%
this 200-foot setback even Des
 
05:58:21.770 --> 05:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
recommends that something needs to be
 
05:58:25.368 --> 05:58:25.378 align:start position:0%
done so that goes without saying
 
05:58:29.628 --> 05:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
but this 602 so the history behind 602
 
05:58:29.638 --> 05:58:30.470 align:start position:0%
but this 602 so the history behind 602
was

05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:58:31.850 --> 05:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
and again a lot of people have
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
reiterated that we've been doing this
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
for four years now right so we we hear a
 
05:58:39.288 --> 05:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth we want to try to
 
05:58:42.170 --> 05:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
accommodate as many people as possible
 
05:58:44.690 --> 05:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
and so many people so many legislators
 
05:58:47.690 --> 05:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
said well we we need something more main
 
05:58:50.570 --> 05:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
like you know why can't we do it like
 
05:58:50.580 --> 05:58:51.770 align:start position:0%
like you know why can't we do it like
Maine

05:58:51.770 --> 05:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
05:58:53.810 --> 05:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
right because Maine
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
has gone through a pain staking uh
 
05:58:59.810 --> 05:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
painstaking technical studies they had
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing and it's been in place
 
05:59:05.170 --> 05:59:05.180 align:start position:0%
for 20 or 25 years now the assistant
 
05:59:07.850 --> 05:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
Deputy uh or the Deputy Commissioner
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
spoke about well that that's conjecture
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
but it's been in place for 20 to 25
 
05:59:13.990 --> 05:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
years haven't seen a lot of things
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the news talking about
 
05:59:19.010 --> 05:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
you know landfill and contamination in
 
05:59:20.930 --> 05:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
Wayne in Maine and that kind of thing so
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.690 --> 05:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
we talk about whether or not now is a
 
05:59:31.970 --> 05:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
good time well now is a perfect time
 
05:59:34.368 --> 05:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
there isn't any active permits for
 
05:59:36.530 --> 05:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state we could
 
05:59:38.208 --> 05:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
speculate all we want but there isn't
 
05:59:40.510 --> 05:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
any active permit and people talk about
 
05:59:43.850 --> 05:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
2034 in capacity well I'd like to say
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that 2034 is probably an
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
underestimate because within the last
 
05:59:50.330 --> 05:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
couple of years or within the last year
 
05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
I should say the solid waste working
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
group actually updated the solid waste
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
plan and one one of the things that they
 
06:00:00.288 --> 06:00:00.298 align:start position:0%
outlined in that plan was a 25 reduction
 
06:00:02.090 --> 06:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
in solid waste output in the state of
 
06:00:04.788 --> 06:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by 2030. now I realize
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
that that's a lofty goal but at the same
 
06:00:10.490 --> 06:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
time even if the state only does half of
 
06:00:14.270 --> 06:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
that that 2034 timeline gets extended a
 
06:00:17.448 --> 06:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
lot further a lot further so the point
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the matter is here we have the time
 
06:00:22.368 --> 06:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
to put something in place to make the
 
06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
right decision for the public health and
 
06:00:26.570 --> 06:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
safety and for the business other people
 
06:00:29.810 --> 06:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 602 House Bill 56 they don't
 
06:00:36.770 --> 06:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
need they're not asking for money you
 
06:00:38.390 --> 06:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
know they're not asking to appropriate
 
06:00:40.250 --> 06:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars to do
 
06:00:42.590 --> 06:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
studies why because they're pretty good
 
06:00:46.430 --> 06:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
when we look at at what is House Bill 56
 
06:00:48.530 --> 06:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
the previous version and this one has
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
been amended because we saw a
 
06:00:51.890 --> 06:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative from Waste Management
 
06:00:53.390 --> 06:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
basically say well last year we're
 
06:00:54.770 --> 06:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
really concerned that you couldn't
 
06:00:56.628 --> 06:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
expand existing landfills and that would
 
06:00:58.010 --> 06:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
be a big problem there was too much
 
06:01:00.770 --> 06:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
ambiguity well Waste Management says I
 
06:01:02.570 --> 06:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
think you've taken the ambiguity out so
 
06:01:04.730 --> 06:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
this is a better bill
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
this is a better Bill what was the
 
06:01:08.750 --> 06:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
primary reason that the governor vetoed
 
06:01:10.730 --> 06:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
last year and believe me we took a
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
painstaking look at why the governor
 
06:01:15.170 --> 06:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
vetoed this bill and what did he say he
 
06:01:16.910 --> 06:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
said because we're concerned we can't
 
06:01:18.708 --> 06:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
expand any existing landfills in the
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
state and we've got to really be in a
 
06:01:20.638 --> 06:01:21.410 align:start position:0%
state and we've got to really be in a
problem

06:01:21.410 --> 06:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:01:24.650 --> 06:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
so what do we do we we basically said we
 
06:01:28.490 --> 06:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
should update and amend what is 56 now
 
06:01:34.490 --> 06:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:37.250 --> 06:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
there was only one bill
 
06:01:40.610 --> 06:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire one
 
06:01:42.410 --> 06:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
that was overridden in the House of
 
06:01:44.530 --> 06:01:44.540 align:start position:0%
Representatives and that was House Bill
 
06:01:48.490 --> 06:01:48.500 align:start position:0%
1454. why because it had cross-section
 
06:01:52.128 --> 06:01:52.138 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support unlike any bill
 
06:01:55.070 --> 06:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
that basically that was vetoed by the
 
06:01:58.368 --> 06:01:58.378 align:start position:0%
governor no other bill was vetoed but
 
06:02:02.330 --> 06:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
this one why because it was a good bill
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
and then it actually passed the house
 
06:02:07.368 --> 06:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
coming in and then ultimately The veto
 
06:02:09.410 --> 06:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't sustained so what do we do we
 
06:02:11.208 --> 06:02:11.218 align:start position:0%
tried to improve
 
06:02:15.410 --> 06:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
so from a conundrum perspective we'd
 
06:02:20.570 --> 06:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
like to say look 56 and and 602 both
 
06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
are good bills
 
06:02:24.170 --> 06:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
to speak about what's going on in
 
06:02:26.690 --> 06:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
another chamber and I applaud Madam
 
06:02:26.700 --> 06:02:28.250 align:start position:0%
another chamber and I applaud Madam
chair

06:02:28.250 --> 06:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't have
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
any business and what's going on here in
 
06:02:33.948 --> 06:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
the house committee
 
06:02:36.110 --> 06:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on over there is conjecture
 
06:02:38.208 --> 06:02:38.218 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate Des saying well there
 
06:02:40.190 --> 06:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
may be some other things
 
06:02:41.930 --> 06:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you
 
06:02:44.448 --> 06:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
these are good bills
 
06:02:46.670 --> 06:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
these can be put in place without a lot
 
06:02:49.010 --> 06:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
of of cost now granted Des may have to
 
06:02:51.410 --> 06:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
go through some some energy and and
 
06:02:54.590 --> 06:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
resources to put these into practice if
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
they become law
 
06:02:58.368 --> 06:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying is let's take a
 
06:03:00.470 --> 06:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
look at what is in front of you I'd
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
recommend past them both
 
06:03:05.570 --> 06:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
give give choices to the Senate
 
06:03:08.090 --> 06:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
let the Senate decide what's good and
 
06:03:11.330 --> 06:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
what's not and we could have a very dare
 
06:03:13.788 --> 06:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
I say robust conversation about this as
 
06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
this continues
 
06:03:15.840 --> 06:03:17.628 align:start position:0%
this continues
so

06:03:17.628 --> 06:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say and I am happy
 
06:03:22.250 --> 06:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I know this has been a long day and
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
you all deserve credit for sitting
 
06:03:26.930 --> 06:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
through this but I'm happy to take any
 
06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
06:03:32.208 --> 06:03:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:34.490 --> 06:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative NAB thank you very much
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's a quick one but since you
 
06:03:37.250 --> 06:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
referenced them in your letter do you
 
06:03:38.448 --> 06:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
know anything about Vermont and
 
06:03:40.448 --> 06:03:40.458 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts standards
 
06:03:42.170 --> 06:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
06:03:42.180 --> 06:03:43.850 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
representative

06:03:43.850 --> 06:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak to the standards but what
 
06:03:49.250 --> 06:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
I can say
 
06:03:52.930 --> 06:03:52.940 align:start position:0%
is that Vermont in Massachusetts
 
06:03:57.530 --> 06:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
are not permitting any new landfills in
 
06:04:01.250 --> 06:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:03.170 --> 06:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a little bit of a
 
06:04:07.490 --> 06:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
challenge in that the existing capacity
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire quite frankly people
 
06:04:13.548 --> 06:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh is certainly ample for many many
 
06:04:15.890 --> 06:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
years to come the elephant in the room
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:23.990 --> 06:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
06:04:27.650 --> 06:04:27.660 align:start position:0%

keep it short
 
06:04:54.660 --> 06:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
keep it short
um

06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:58.010 --> 06:04:58.020 align:start position:0%

06:05:02.110 --> 06:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
and your patience has been extraordinary
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
I agree with Mr tower that both bills
 
06:05:07.730 --> 06:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
should be passed I'm very glad that
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
these are in the house these are policy
 
06:05:12.048 --> 06:05:12.058 align:start position:0%
committees this is important policy it's
 
06:05:13.730 --> 06:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
critically important at this time to
 
06:05:16.190 --> 06:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire going forward we
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't have two years the time for the
 
06:05:19.690 --> 06:05:19.700 align:start position:0%
Des to be
 
06:05:23.448 --> 06:05:23.458 align:start position:0%
proactively studying and researching how
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
to improve citing regulations was some
 
06:05:29.628 --> 06:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
years ago I was around on the Seacoast
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
in the 70s and 80s when Coakley was
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
operating grew up over there
 
06:05:36.350 --> 06:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
that followed it sense was there when it
 
06:05:36.360 --> 06:05:37.788 align:start position:0%
that followed it sense was there when it
closed

06:05:37.788 --> 06:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
closed
 
06:05:39.048 --> 06:05:39.058 align:start position:0%
there was discussion today about
 
06:05:42.288 --> 06:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
remediation Coakley still has not been
 
06:05:44.270 --> 06:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
remediated millions and millions of
 
06:05:46.910 --> 06:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
dollars have been spent
 
06:05:46.920 --> 06:05:47.868 align:start position:0%
dollars have been spent
um

06:05:47.868 --> 06:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
after Des was formed in 86 and I should
 
06:05:52.310 --> 06:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
point out the first commissioner came
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the waste industry
 
06:05:56.448 --> 06:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
rules were soon being written for the
 
06:05:59.330 --> 06:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
air division the waste Division I was at
 
06:06:03.288 --> 06:06:03.298 align:start position:0%
some of those meetings and Industry
 
06:06:06.170 --> 06:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
basically dominated the rulemaking they
 
06:06:07.910 --> 06:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
had the resources they had the time and
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
they had the interest and those are the
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
rules that we're living with today in
 
06:06:14.628 --> 06:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
terms of citing so in 2023
 
06:06:18.048 --> 06:06:18.058 align:start position:0%
with the changes that we've seen in in
 
06:06:19.788 --> 06:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
the marketplace for resource management
 
06:06:21.708 --> 06:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
and waste management I think we really
 
06:06:23.410 --> 06:06:23.420 align:start position:0%
need to just
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
stop and and get hold of what frankly is
 
06:06:29.628 --> 06:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
really quite a dangerous situation for
 
06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
the state because people have talked
 
06:06:33.048 --> 06:06:33.058 align:start position:0%
about things flowing downhill a waste
 
06:06:35.810 --> 06:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
flows downhill as well and we are at the
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
bottom of the hill thanks very much
 
06:06:40.250 --> 06:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions uh
 
06:06:42.530 --> 06:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
06:06:42.540 --> 06:06:43.250 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
chair

06:06:43.250 --> 06:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question and
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
this might be
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh maybe even more to Des but if my
 
06:06:50.810 --> 06:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
memory serves me correct Coakley
 
06:06:53.690 --> 06:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
landfill is a designated Superfund Site
 
06:06:55.788 --> 06:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:07:00.048 --> 06:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:07:02.708 --> 06:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for speaking with us
 
06:07:22.250 --> 06:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.260 --> 06:07:24.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:07:24.110 --> 06:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:07:26.690 --> 06:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
like to please request that if anything
 
06:07:29.628 --> 06:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
has already been spoken of that we can
 
06:07:31.610 --> 06:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
skip it thank you madam chairman I was
 
06:07:34.368 --> 06:07:34.378 align:start position:0%
going to start with that statement I'm
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
passing around my written testimony I
 
06:07:39.048 --> 06:07:39.058 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to read one part
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
um there's a disclaimer but for the
 
06:07:43.310 --> 06:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is Eric steinhauser I
 
06:07:45.288 --> 06:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
made my introduction before
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I do need to say that
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I am a member of the New Hampshire
 
06:07:51.288 --> 06:07:51.298 align:start position:0%
Waste Management Council representing
 
06:07:53.570 --> 06:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
licensed engineers and I represent the
 
06:07:55.850 --> 06:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
Council on the new New Hampshire uh
 
06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
solways working group my testimony today
 
06:08:00.230 --> 06:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
is mine and does not represent opinions
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
or thoughts of the waste management
 
06:08:04.490 --> 06:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
Council or the Southwest working group
 
06:08:07.730 --> 06:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
I will not repeat what I said earlier
 
06:08:09.170 --> 06:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
um or some of the testimony that's
 
06:08:10.670 --> 06:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
already been made and I will keep my
 
06:08:14.810 --> 06:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
comments to the legislation components
 
06:08:17.208 --> 06:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
first I just want to reiterate the
 
06:08:21.470 --> 06:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
difference between a statute and a rule
 
06:08:21.480 --> 06:08:22.730 align:start position:0%
difference between a statute and a rule
um

06:08:22.730 --> 06:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
the statute is is you know
 
06:08:29.090 --> 06:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
to use the the pastor's uh comment is is
 
06:08:32.510 --> 06:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
Gospel we have to follow that a rule if
 
06:08:33.890 --> 06:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with the rule we can
 
06:08:33.900 --> 06:08:35.208 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with the rule we can
negotiate

06:08:35.208 --> 06:08:35.218 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
um how to apply that rule based on the
 
06:08:39.890 --> 06:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
actual site that would not happen with
 
06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
06:08:43.070 --> 06:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
so the preference would be to have
 
06:08:45.530 --> 06:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
things in rules not not prescriptive in
 
06:08:48.288 --> 06:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
a statute I do encourage the committee
 
06:08:49.910 --> 06:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to learn about landfills
 
06:08:51.650 --> 06:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
and we've heard some testimony that
 
06:08:53.868 --> 06:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
really has applied to unlined and old
 
06:08:56.690 --> 06:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
landfills not the new modern landfills
 
06:08:59.270 --> 06:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
that are built designed built in and
 
06:09:02.350 --> 06:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
operated under the rules that Des has
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
personally I'm not aware of any
 
06:09:07.548 --> 06:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
remediation being applied at any of the
 
06:09:11.448 --> 06:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
new line landfills in the state
 
06:09:13.310 --> 06:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and I also want to uh just talk about
 
06:09:15.048 --> 06:09:15.058 align:start position:0%
a comment that was made about the
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
maximum value that a applicant can go in
 
06:09:18.240 --> 06:09:19.490 align:start position:0%
maximum value that a applicant can go in
a

06:09:19.490 --> 06:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:09:21.708 --> 06:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
reduce the average number by getting a
 
06:09:23.810 --> 06:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
lot of data I would also challenge that
 
06:09:26.448 --> 06:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
theory is that you can challenge the the
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
value because she didn't find the
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
highest value like you didn't study
 
06:09:32.270 --> 06:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
enough to find the one location that had
 
06:09:34.368 --> 06:09:34.378 align:start position:0%
the highest value that could ever be on
 
06:09:37.548 --> 06:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
that site so our high geologist friends
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
are doing their best to characterize the
 
06:09:43.190 --> 06:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
site Based on data but just to use a one
 
06:09:46.030 --> 06:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
value and not consider the whole site
 
06:09:48.650 --> 06:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
holistically is a
 
06:09:50.690 --> 06:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
I think a scientific issue it also
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
presents problems for engineers as we're
 
06:09:54.650 --> 06:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
trying to use
 
06:09:58.070 --> 06:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the whole site as as a
 
06:09:59.868 --> 06:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
for our work
 
06:09:59.878 --> 06:10:02.208 align:start position:0%
for our work
um

06:10:02.208 --> 06:10:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to mention is
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
is there is a discussion about the map
 
06:10:08.090 --> 06:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
it came up a couple times that had the
 
06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
stratified drift in a potentially yellow
 
06:10:12.530 --> 06:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
spot on the map where we could put all
 
06:10:15.170 --> 06:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
our waste forever which not included in
 
06:10:16.548 --> 06:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
that map there's all the other citing
 
06:10:19.010 --> 06:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
criteria in our current rules
 
06:10:21.770 --> 06:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
um that by topography and by other
 
06:10:23.810 --> 06:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
issues would really limit where we could
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
put landfills so
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I agree with a study process Des is
 
06:10:31.310 --> 06:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
going through their rule making they
 
06:10:32.930 --> 06:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
have to renew their sideways rules now
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's in the process could they be made
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
stronger and better for for both sides
 
06:10:39.170 --> 06:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
of the aisle I think so
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but just to be prescriptive and just
 
06:10:44.590 --> 06:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
pick values whether they're arbitrarily
 
06:10:47.868 --> 06:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
selected or not or how you view that I
 
06:10:49.788 --> 06:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
think the study process is a more
 
06:10:51.890 --> 06:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate procedure
 
06:10:53.628 --> 06:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any questions thank
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
06:10:56.638 --> 06:10:59.390 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
committee

06:10:59.390 --> 06:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you for your
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon I do not have
 
06:11:05.930 --> 06:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
any more pink cards does anybody else
 
06:11:07.490 --> 06:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
wish to speak
 
06:11:12.890 --> 06:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:16.390 --> 06:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:21.048 --> 06:11:21.058 align:start position:0%
I would Now call this oh I need the blue
 
06:11:21.058 --> 06:11:23.048 align:start position:0%
I would Now call this oh I need the blue
sheet

06:11:23.048 --> 06:11:23.058 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
06:11:26.650 --> 06:11:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
and online we had
 
06:11:31.930 --> 06:11:31.940 align:start position:0%
um for 602
 
06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
285 people in favor of this legislation
 
06:11:48.830 --> 06:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:52.070 --> 06:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
and on the blue sheet
 
06:11:54.530 --> 06:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
we had
 
06:11:57.708 --> 06:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven eight
 
06:12:06.650 --> 06:12:06.660 align:start position:0%

and next week
 
06:12:20.690 --> 06:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
on um February 28th
 
06:12:22.610 --> 06:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
we will have a full committee work
 
06:12:24.470 --> 06:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
session or we're planning to have a full
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee work session on these three
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
bills that we heard today
 
06:12:33.170 --> 06:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
um plus one other hp221
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then in the afternoon we will be
 
06:12:38.868 --> 06:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
executing a plethora of bills
 
06:12:38.878 --> 06:12:40.070 align:start position:0%
executing a plethora of bills
so

06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:40.080 --> 06:12:41.150 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:43.010 --> 06:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's all I'd like to say about this
 
06:12:44.930 --> 06:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank everybody for

hopefully we will be in conversation
 
06:12:55.500 --> 06:12:57.770 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will be in conversation
about

06:12:57.770 --> 06:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:12:59.930 --> 06:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
um where we're going to be going with uh
 
06:13:01.610 --> 06:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
with what we've heard today
