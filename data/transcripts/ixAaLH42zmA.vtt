representative
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
this this morning
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
this bill was put for forward at the
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
request and in consultation with Grafton
 
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 align:start position:0%
County officials
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
since the LSR was drafted and released
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
we have learned that there is much more
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
work to be done on this bill and to fill
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
you in on the details of that work I'd
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
like to turn this over to representative

and economic is it Economic Development
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
Recreation Recreation that's the piece I
 
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
was forgetting thank you there isn't
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
much in the way of Economic Development
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
no well maybe sort of kind of anyways so
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
I wanted to because I'm chair of the
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
Grafton County delegation I've been in
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
pretty close contact and consultation
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
with uh the Commissioners and the um
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
the professional staff of Grafton County
 
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.909 align:start position:0%
the professional staff of Grafton County
Government

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
Government
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
the details of the Genesis of this bill
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
was there's a single small company
 
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:16.940 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Power and Light that provides
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
electricity Water and Sewer to the
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Complex because it's such
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
a tiny company
 
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.089 align:start position:0%
a tiny company
um

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:28.580 align:start position:0%
the rates are exceptionally High
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
the just to keep your perspective
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
some ways in the neighborhood of about a
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a month is what
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
it costs to run just the County Complex
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
and the the County Complex represents 25
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
percent of their business
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a really complex issue because
 
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
Grafton County taxpayers are paying
 
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:53.540 align:start position:0%
a really serious amount of money
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
by RSA
 
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
Grafton County can look for alternative
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
sources of electricity that's new new
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
developments in the last few years they
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
can also look for for the example of
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
putting in some artesian wells to
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
replace the water
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
however under existing RSA
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
then they have to
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
ask for a waiver from the the company
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
that provides sewer
 
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.260 align:start position:0%
that company has refused to
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
decline to give a waiver
 
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.329 align:start position:0%
decline to give a waiver
um unfortunately

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
there hadn't been a really great working
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
relationship between the county complex
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
and the company
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
so that became the Genesis of the
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioners asking for this bill to be
 
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.710 align:start position:0%
Commissioners asking for this bill to be
introduced

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime and this is the
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
important point in the meantime
 
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:49.730 align:start position:0%
important point in the meantime
um

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
some really excellent conversations have
 
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.170 align:start position:0%
some really excellent conversations have
begun

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
begun
 
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.889 align:start position:0%
begun
um

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
we have learned things from Des that
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
gave us pause as sponsors we have
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
learned things from the New Hampshire
 
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association that gave us some
 
00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:09.050 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association that gave us some
pause

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
pause
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and we're they are both those
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
organizations are talking with the
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Power and Light and also with
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
the County Government
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
and we are making progress towards
 
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
finding a better solution perhaps even a
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solution but I wanted to
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
make it clear that this is progress not
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
final solution
 
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
final solution
so

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative stavis the prime sponsor
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
and myself
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
um we are requesting respectfully that
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
you retain this bill
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
so that we have time to continue those
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
discussions and hopefully find an
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
excellent solution for all the taxpayers
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
of Grafton County and as well as the
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%

municipal Association we agree that

retention is the best option at this
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
point in time and that's all I want to
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%

uh

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
is that Trace Tracy Tracy woods from New
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
hi Tracy wood I'm the administrator of
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater engineering Bureau at New
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des that resides in the Water
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
Division under rainy Pelletier we have
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
provided a letter of concern today if
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
this bill were to be moved forward you
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
would see our concerns we are happy that
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
the bill is being retained while the
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
parties are having discussions and we
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
have been a part of those discussions
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
and we hope that they will come up with
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
a mutually agreeable solution but we do
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
have concerns If This Were to move
 
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:57.380 align:start position:0%
forward and the biggest is that
 
00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:01.339 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities are
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
designed for a certain flow and loading
 
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
and if you make my major modifications
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
to the flows and loadings coming in that
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
changes the treatment process and so
 
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
there's concerns on that level that
 
00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
taking out a major contributor would
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
have a detrimental impact on the
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
operation of the wastewater treatment
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
facility and in addition when
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
a wastewater treatment facility is built
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
you're basing that on a certain number
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
of users that's the flows and loadings
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
and then that determines your rate
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
structure so
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
pulling out a big contributor changes
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
the rate structure and that puts the
 
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
rates out on the other users when that
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
entity pulls out so you'll see that as
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
some of our concerns in our letter so
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's it for today but thank you for
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
for listening
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions by members of
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
my question just I just want to confirm
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
you your agree with retaining this
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think that's the best path
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm glad that the parties
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
are having discussions and that we're
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
being a part of that thanks mm-hmm
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative harp
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question with the idea
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
of the rate in telling people that they
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
can or can't tie in that's my
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
understanding in Massachusetts where I
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
work that if a line is put in the street
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
and under Title Five they say if your
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
system fails you have to tie in but they
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
don't I believe mandate tying in if your
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
system is still
 
00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
system is still
um

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.110 align:start position:0%
um
passing

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
passing
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm just confused by why here you you
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
set the rate by everybody supposedly
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
tying in maybe at some point in 2050
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
everybody will be tied in but that
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
really impacts the design of the system
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
yes yes so grafting when they built the
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
original wastewater treatment facility
 
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:13.940 align:start position:0%
Grafton County was part of that design
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
now you're talking about adding new
 
00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
users in after the design of the plant
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
and each plant is built with a certain
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
amount of capacity for future growth you
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
have to look out when you're designing a
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
major wastewater treatment facility you
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
have to look out 20 years and what's the
 
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019 align:start position:0%
growth projected in that time period in
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
your particular situation
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
as far as people connecting in you are
 
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
correct so if a town has an existing
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
system and they're doing a sewer
 
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.750 align:start position:0%
system and they're doing a sewer
extension

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
not everyone is mandated to connect on
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
especially if they're extending out and
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
some people are in private systems they
 
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
do wait until they fail and then when
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
the system fails most municipalities
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
will ask that they connect in a lot of
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
times sewer extensions are being done in
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
areas where think about around a pond or
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
a lake and you have all these individual
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
septic systems and they've been in there
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
for quite some time and they're all
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
failing and in order to protect public
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
health and the environment and the water
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
quality and that water body
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing a sewer extension and
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
eliminate the private systems but in
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
that case usually everyone's on board
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
because everyone who lives around that
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
Ponder water body wants to protect it
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
right because they're using it for
 
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.970 align:start position:0%
right because they're using it for
recreation

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.050 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
finally uh Kate hergan
 
00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:53.899 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
counties that I've
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
did I pronounced that correctly pretty
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
darn close thank you Mr chairman my name
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
is Kate Horgan I represent the New
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties which
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
is all your elected and appointed
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
officials in County government in this
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
case we would ask that the committee
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
retain the bill as the parties continue
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
to work towards a non-legislative
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
seeing no one thank you very much thank
 
00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.570 align:start position:0%
seeing no one thank you very much thank
you

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
having no additional pink cards
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak if not I will
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
next bill is and we will not you have to
 
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.789 align:start position:0%
next bill is and we will not you have to
wait

00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
wait
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
let's do that
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
hospital that's a 10 205 is in 10 is 10
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
45 so
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
you can now go around and visit
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves
 
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:34.090 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves
up

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
like to call a hearing to order on House
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
Bill 205
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
relative to testing private Wells
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
I will call the
 
00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
first the sponsor for sponsor
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
allowing me to introduce HB 205 to your
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee this bill actually emerged as
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
part of the work of the Seacoast
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
Commission on long-term goals and
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
requirements for drinking water which is
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
a mouthful you have to drink a glass of
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
water actually after you say the whole
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
thing but one of the things that the
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
commission is charged with doing is
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
assessing threats to drinking water
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
supplies and also preparing
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
contingencies in case of droughts and
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
other types of emergency including
 
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:49.460 align:start position:0%
contamination emergencies
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
the commission also monitors the work of
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
different state agencies like the
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services we
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually have a member of of the
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
commission who is from Des and he briefs
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
us quite frequently on issues regarding
 
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
drought contamination and drinking water
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
supplies across the Seacoast
 
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
um part of the commission's work because
 
00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:17.099 align:start position:0%
so many people in New Hampshire have
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
private Wells has been trying to better
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
understand the level of contamination in
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
private uh well drinking water
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
um in uh in 2021 one of the things the
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
commission uh uh did was it applied for
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
and received some funding to pay for a
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
pilot program to test private wells in
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
Seacoast communities for traditional
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants as well as pfas
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
um while the results are are really just
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
sort of starting to flicker in uh from
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
from that effort
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that actually uh
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
surprised us and and to be honest with
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
you blew us away uh last summer was a
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
presentation uh that uh the Department
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services made to us uh
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
according to Des New Hampshire has about
 
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.390 align:start position:0%
according to Des New Hampshire has about
250

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
250
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
000 private Wells
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and so far out of the ten thousand
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
private Wells sampled 86 percent had
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
detectable levels of pfas and 30 percent
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
of all the wells tested that's 30
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
percent of the 10 000 plus Wells that
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
were tested had pfas levels exceeding
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
state standards for one of the four uh
 
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.060 align:start position:0%
regulated forms of pfas
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
that surprised us and it was one of the
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
reasons why the legislative members of
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
the the commission decided to to
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
basically take a look at a bill from
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
2020 HB 667 which passed in the house
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
and died because of covid
 
00:49:54.839 --> 00:49:55.550 align:start position:0%
and died because of covid
um

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
that um that would have required that
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
that basically would have required a
 
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
private well installers to test for
 
00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:07.700 align:start position:0%
certain contaminants
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
before and uh and and notify the uh the
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
homeowners of the presence of those
 
00:50:14.339 --> 00:50:15.849 align:start position:0%
homeowners of the presence of those
contaminants

00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:15.859 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest differences between
 
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.010 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest differences between
hb667

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:21.020 align:start position:0%
hb667
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
and the current bill that's in front of
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
you now is HB 667 did not include pfas
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals I'm not 100 sure why the
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
reason for that is but I think one of
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
the things that's become apparent over
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
the last uh several years and I know a
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
lot of this is especially had folks on
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
this committee pretty hard
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
um uh the level of knowledge that we
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
have about about these chemicals and the
 
00:50:50.049 --> 00:50:50.059 align:start position:0%
dangers that they present is really
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
increased a Quantum level since where we
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
were in in 2020 which is the reason that
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals are added to the bill
 
00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:01.700 align:start position:0%
listen uh before you today
 
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:06.059 align:start position:0%
what uh HP 205 would do would be to add
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
the four regulated compounds pfas
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
compounds uh that uh that New Hampshire
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
currently regulates
 
00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:16.940 align:start position:0%
um uh and it would also
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
add any additional it would also any
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
additional uh pfas compounds that uh
 
00:51:27.849 --> 00:51:27.859 align:start position:0%
that Des adds administratively
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
would actually be added to to
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and the other part of the
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill I wanted to call your attention to
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
is uh is a requirement that if
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
detectable levels of other pfas
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
compounds are actually found in that
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
Community then
 
00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:46.220 align:start position:0%
testing for those
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
compounds would also be required this is
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
how we get to things like Gen X in
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
Merrimack in Litchfield and Bedford and
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
other communities that have been
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
affected by Saint goban Gen X to this
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
point is not one of the regular related
 
00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:05.300 align:start position:0%
chemicals in in New Hampshire
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
but I think the evidence is becoming uh
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
clearer and clearer that these chemicals
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
are causing uh are causing harm uh and
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
what this bill would uh would do would
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
be to give homeowners who have new
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
private Wells installed uh
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
basically the the ability to know what
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with it doesn't require
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
them to actually remediate the
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
contamination so we're not requiring
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
that people install
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
filtration systems or anything of that
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
nature would it would it what it does do
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
is is it would force uh pump installers
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
to uh to secure testing to provide the
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
test results to the homeowner and it
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
would also require the homeowner if
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
there are contaminants that actually are
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
detected to notify anyone who purchases
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
the property in the future that there
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
are contaminants in those Wells
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
so so basically this bill is about
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
helping people understand what it is
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
that they're dealing with
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
um uh and I think one of the biggest
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
takeaways uh for for us was the extent
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
of the problem
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I think we were kind of laboring
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
under the illusion that well gee you
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
know we know pfas is an issue in our
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
public drinking water supplies in my
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
community of Portsmouth actually all of
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
our current water sources have some
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
detectable levels of pfas but for some
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
reason and it was in most likely
 
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.790 align:start position:0%
reason and it was in most likely
ignorance

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
ignorance
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
we just didn't think that the problem
 
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:51.980 align:start position:0%
extended to that level in private Wells
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
but hearing that 86 percent of the ten
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
thousand Wells that Des has tested also
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
have distractible levels of pfas and 30
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
percent have levels above the uh you
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
know the New Hampshire is actually very
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
very stringent
 
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.430 align:start position:0%
very stringent
requirements

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
for the four compounds that are
 
00:54:14.819 --> 00:54:16.030 align:start position:0%
for the four compounds that are
regulated

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's just a warning sign and
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're not in a position
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
where we can re regulate the
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of these chemicals they
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
still continue to go into the
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
environment there's a long legal process
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and lawmaking process involved to
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually stop it at the source
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that we can do is
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
a better job of helping people
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
understand what they're dealing with and
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I think at the that's really the
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
root of what this bill is all about
 
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:47.300 align:start position:0%
we're trying to inform
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
homeowners of the situation they
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
potentially face and then we leave it up
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
to them as to how they want to address
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
it one of the things that I did want to
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
add is the state of New Hampshire also
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
has a program right now that if if
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
detectable levels of pfas are detected
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
in a private will you can actually
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
receive a five thousand dollar rebate
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
um uh for uh installing uh filtration
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
equipment to help to help remove it
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
so we're currently trying to address
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
this problem at multiple levels but but
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
ten thousand Wells tested when we have a
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million wells in the state
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we have a lot of work
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
to do and there are a lot of people out
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
there who may not know that they're in
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
this situation so we want to make it
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
easier for them to do that
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
any questions members of the committee
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative wolf followed by
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
you have a quarter of a million wells in
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that exists
 
00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:01.250 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that exists
today

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
but you're only going after the new
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
wells that are being drilled
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be legislation
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
we've got a seller has to have a or a
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
buyer has to have a well tested I don't
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
know which side you want to put it on
 
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.530 align:start position:0%
know which side you want to put it on
but

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
it should be going after the 250 000
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
Wells as opposed to the very small
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
number that are being drilled this year
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
or next year or Etc
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
is would that be a good idea sure
 
00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:35.579 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things that we're
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
trying to do is we're trying to get a
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
start here and then depending on
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
where the severity of the the problem
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
goes I think we can ex it's extend it
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
from there and if the committee decides
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
that that's something that that that you
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
would like to do I think that would be
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
uh finding a way to you know to so more
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
people could actually benefit from
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
testing uh you know would be good I
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
think the situation is that we currently
 
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the best times to do
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
testing like this and and one of the
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
most necessary times is one is when
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
people do put in a new well that's when
 
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
you really want to know you're putting
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
in a you basically you're putting in an
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
entire system
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh this is essentially a good
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
idea for anybody to do and I think uh
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
anybody who owns a private well in New
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire given the level of natural
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
contaminants not just pfas but things
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
like Arsenic and copper and manganese
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
and some of the other things that some
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
of the other people testifying today
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
will will tell you about
 
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.690 align:start position:0%
will will tell you about
um

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:40.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
we have an illusion I think that that
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
our well water is pure because it comes
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
from inside the ground but there are a
 
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
lot there are a lot of things inside the
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
ground and arsenic is a big one that can
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
hurt us if we're not aware of them and
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
we keep drinking it so so I think one of
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the things we're hoping to do
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
is to raise awareness of the situation
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
through this bill of what our situation
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
is with private Wells
 
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things we were
 
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
very much aware of is trying not to to
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
bite off more than we can chew in a
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
first bite but if you would if the
 
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
committee would like to bite off a
 
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
no more questions thank you
 
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
my question so this bill seems to have
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
you know two parts to it right one is
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
the testing part and then one is the
 
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
notification part I actually have
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions about both but I'll start with
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
the second piece which is the
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
notification part
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
when I read it and I I believe I've
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
signed this kind of
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
um you know notification before in the
 
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
previous language but when I read it the
 
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:56.270 align:start position:0%
previous language but when I read it the
the

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
um it becomes the language used is much
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
more alarmist
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and the last Clause of the existing
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
RSA says that basically there's nothing
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
to require that this bill that this
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
Clause even be provided because there's
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
no you know there's no ramifications if
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's not and so I wonder by making the
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
language of this clause
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
I mean I I would use the word word
 
00:59:24.049 --> 00:59:24.059 align:start position:0%
alarmist a little bit if people might be
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
inclined to just omit it all together
 
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
since there is no lack and since there
 
00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure I'm not sure I get the
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
full uh so what I'm trying what I'm
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
referring to is in section you know if
 
00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:44.180 align:start position:0%
you look at 477
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
4a2 which is on line 24 of the last page
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
right this is nothing in this section
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to have an impact on
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
the legal validity uh the transfer or
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
place any liability on a seller or
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
seller's agent so basically it says if
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
you don't provide this at this
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
notification there's no there's no
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
recourse so it makes me wonder
 
01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:09.299 align:start position:0%
if by making the language you know
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
um more flagrant maybe that's too loud a
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
too strong a word that people just stop
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
including it at all if they're if
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
they're worried about it and if it was
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
toned down a little bit especially that
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
first paragraph and you just added this
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
section about pfas if it
 
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.210 align:start position:0%
section about pfas if it
if

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
um it might be more you know supported
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
by the broader you know real real to a
 
01:00:32.339 --> 01:00:35.150 align:start position:0%
by the broader you know real real to a
community

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that I saw
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
happen with uh just looking at the
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
history of HB 667 is that the committee
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
did make several attempts uh the last
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
time uh to adjust that language
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and I and I think
 
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I would expect uh that if the com in
 
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
the language that I actually pulled is
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
where we essentially wound up with uh
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
with HP 667 if you would like to make
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
that language uh a stronger less
 
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
that language uh a stronger less
intimidating

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
intimidating
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
um uh whatever you would like to do with
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
it that's fine I think the important
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
thing is that people are notified
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
um you know in you know in in a transfer
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
property that's just something uh that
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
you would want to know
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
um and I remember when I moved uh up to
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from my home in
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
Connecticut one of the things that I had
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
to do was disclose that there had been
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
an oil tank buried in my front yard I
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
to provide paperwork around the fact
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
that that oil tank had been removed and
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
that there was no trace of any petroleum
 
01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:45.059 align:start position:0%
products uh in the soil or anything like
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
that so these things are actually you
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
know pretty common in in Property
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
Transfers around the country
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
um and given the emerging threat uh from
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
from pfas I think this is something that
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
or for a follow-up thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
um that's not the way I read what this
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
is saying this is not a
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
um this is saying
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
um these are common substances and you
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
should test your well for it rather than
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
um these substances have been found
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way I read you know
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
lines 5 through 13 on the last page this
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
is not saying this is not a declaration
 
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
so you're referring to
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
um uh Roman Roman numeral two nothing in
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
this section
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
no I I what you just described was these
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
decorations well we're going back and
 
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
forth on a
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
one area
 
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
one area
uh

01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
let's why don't we try to see if you
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
can't wrap it up if we can't wrap it up
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
let's go on to something else because
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're you know we there is a lot of
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
folks to testify that uh information may
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
come out out of that
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
testimony and then we still have to be
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
able to there's we have to then work on
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
the bill and that could be part of that
 
01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:18.230 align:start position:0%
the bill and that could be part of that
discussion

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay maybe I'll just move on can I have
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
a follow-on for the first part of the
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill talks about
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know basically the well driller has
 
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
you know basically the well driller has
to

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
um to um you know to do this testing on
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
the owner's behalf have you considered
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
um per you know providing the materials
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
have um having the well driller provide
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
the materials so the homeowner could
 
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
the materials so the homeowner could
optionally

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
optionally
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
um do the do the drilling or do the
 
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.069 align:start position:0%
um do the do the drilling or do the
testing

01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
so that the whole I'm sorry so material
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
so having had gone through this process
 
01:03:58.079 --> 01:03:59.150 align:start position:0%
so having had gone through this process
myself

01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
I know that you can get the um the
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
materials to have the testing done by
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
the state and submit them yourself
 
01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:09.109 align:start position:0%
the state and submit them yourself
and

01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
um rather than having the contractor do
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
it on your behalf and then my question
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
is whether you have considered
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
um having the contractor provide you
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
know the sampling kit to the homeowner
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
so that they could submit it to the
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
state for the testing rather than
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
submitting it on their behalf and
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately charging for that
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
I I am not an expert in pfas testing but
 
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.170 align:start position:0%
I I am not an expert in pfas testing but
um

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:35.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
having dealt with some of those test
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
kits and things like that and other
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
things as a homeowner one of the things
 
01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:43.099 align:start position:0%
I would be concerned about
 
01:04:43.099 --> 01:04:44.630 align:start position:0%
I would be concerned about
is

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
um is the homeowner you know doing the
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
sampling from the right place is there a
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
particular way it has to be done
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I think ensuring that the that the
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
pump installer is responsible for doing
 
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:01.700 align:start position:0%
it would ensure that it's done
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
consistently and and most likely
 
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.109 align:start position:0%
consistently and and most likely
correctly

01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think any of us may have
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
have ever sampled water for pfest before
 
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's easier than I think it is
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
or less complicated but if if it if it
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
if it gets to a point where it's
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
something that that homeowners can do my
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
hope would be that more of those
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
20 you know 240 000 homeowners who
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
haven't had their Wells sampled yet uh
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
would start would start to do it
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh I mean these are the things
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
that that we're going to need to look at
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
because the scope of this of this
 
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.950 align:start position:0%
because the scope of this of this
problem

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
um looks you know potentially very very
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
large and this bill is actually a very
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
very small part of trying to get our our
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
arms around it
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
um you know beyond detection there's a
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
whole issue of of remediation there's
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of Health impacts when
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
we don't remediate in time
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
um uh you know that this is something
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
that we're starting to see in community
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
after community in New Hampshire
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
and uh in the legislature I think one of
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
the things we're able to do is we're
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
able to take a small piece uh and make
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
something good happen and I would kind
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
of put this bill in that category what's
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
a lot harder for us to do is to solve
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
the pfas problem
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
um in in one two or three bills and I
 
01:06:38.589 --> 01:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to get there but
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
I do think that there are small things
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
that we can do along the way that can
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
improve the situation
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
help reduce exposure for people who
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have been exposed and um
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I hope you uh agree to either give
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
the pet the bill or not to pass
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation or make a better bill out
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
of it and then give it a not to pass
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for a question
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
um online on page two on line 33 when
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're adding language relative to radon
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
you mention how it uh it can increase oh
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
actually I'm sorry it's on line 30. you
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned resulting in levels of radon
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
that increase the risk of lung cancer
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
and other diseases but in other areas of
 
01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:41.299 align:start position:0%
that section when you're
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
discussing pfas and lead and arsenic
 
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're not mentioning the health impacts
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
was there a deliberate reason for that
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
no I I think one of the things that I
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to do
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
um in the bill was to keep as much
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
similarity as I could with the original
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
language of
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
hb667 so these were changes that were
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
actually made to 667 before it was
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
passed in the house uh in in 2020 uh if
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
there is if you if if the committee
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
decided to put information uh about
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
additional health impact for some of
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
those other chemicals I think those
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
would be those would be good additions
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
especially for people who have those
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
chemicals detected in their Wells and it
 
01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:30.299 align:start position:0%
would have to be notified of them
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of information on the
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
internet but there's a lot of power and
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
a notice that can kind of get you
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
started in your search uh so the bottom
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
line is is that I think that would be a
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
good addition okay a lot follow-up or a
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay thank you Mr chair so um
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative would you be willing to
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
work with me on an amendment because I
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
would like to have stronger language
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
around lead just because of what we've
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
seen on the terrible impacts to children
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
in their cognitive development with even
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
very very small amounts to lead and
 
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
additionally with pfas EPA came out last
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
June with a health advisory essentially
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
saying it was parts per quadrillion
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
levels anything above that is unsafe and
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
has Health impacts so
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
um would so would you be willing to work
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
with me on an amendment to provide some
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
more informative language around the
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative harved and representative
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Vale
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
taking this question in your amendments
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm a real estate transactional attorney
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
would you have a problem or a
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation regarding the effective
 
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.370 align:start position:0%
recommendation regarding the effective
date

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
um being in the real estate industry
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
business I understand the seriousness of
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
all these issues but I'm just wondering
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
why the effective date wasn't asked for
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
January 1 2024.
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
again the the effective date is uh is a
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
leftover from uh from 667 and I can
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
understand why uh why uh uh 60 days uh
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
might not be adequate notice for the
 
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
real estate community so that would be
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that would definitely be something we
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
could look at in terms of an amendment
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vale for a
 
01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.189 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vale for a
question

01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing in this bill
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at on page two line 12
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
where it says Roman numeral six failure
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
to test a well or submit the laboratory
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
report resulting from such Test Section
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
shall be a violation
 
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I do don't have the um the
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
the numerals I have the bill in front of
 
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
me but I have the online version which
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't have my numbers uh so if you
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
could if you could just tell me the
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral section is um
 
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral six okay
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you approximately 12 lines down
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
all right from the top where it says um
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
so my question is about
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
um resulting from
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
such Test Section shall be a violation
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't see where the violation is
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise described either in the bill
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
or in law
 
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.070 align:start position:0%
or in law
existing

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
so this would be on the part of the
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
installer of the pump who did not
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps oh Phil who failed to test a
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:47.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
does it belong in there
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
not whether or not it belongs in there
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
it just says here that there is a
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
violation for the failure of the of the
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
person who we are asking this bill is
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
asking to be responsible for the testing
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
and so if that is a violation then what
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the subsequent actions that get taken
 
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
with that violation in order for the um
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill to be
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
um a reality for the homeowner
 
01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Representatives
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
heart a violation in um I know in
 
01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
criminal law is not not an offense that
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
actually appears on your criminal record
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
um only misdemeanors and felonies appear
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
on a criminal record and I believe
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh a violation would be a penalty of up
 
01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
what I am what I am what I am not 100
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
sure of is
 
01:12:45.719 --> 01:12:46.330 align:start position:0%
sure of is
um

01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:46.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement of that violation and and
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
I and I think that might be a good uh
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
question for uh uh for the folks from
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
Des if they are here
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
um uh to testify to uh but the I but
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
essentially the idea is that failure to
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
do the testing should have some sort of
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
a consequence
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
um and it's an effort uh
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
to put uh some teeth into the bill even
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
being no one from the no one else from
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%

representing the town of Merrimack I'm

01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 205 and act relative to testing
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
private Wells
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
this bill requires the installers of new
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
well pumps test the water for certain
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
contaminants and it also requires
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
property buyers to be notified of the
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
presence of these contaminants in the
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
water before the property can be sold
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
everything on the list on page two is
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
known to cause ill health to humans I'm
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to focus on items p q r s and t
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
which are the pfas chemicals in our
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
fairly new additions to water testing
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
when a similar bill was introduced in
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
2020 there was some skepticism about the
 
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
need for everyone in the state to test
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
for pfas
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
legislators knew that there was a
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
problem on the Seacoast and in Southern
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but they thought pfas
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
contamination was isolated to those
 
01:14:53.219 --> 01:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
contamination was isolated to those
areas

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
it is now three years later and we know
 
01:14:59.689 --> 01:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
that pfas is found virtually everywhere
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
it's near our landfills our corporations
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
near airports and fire stations it's in
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
our bio waste it's even been found in
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
our orange juice
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
what was thought to be an
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
over-exaggeration of Health impacts in
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
2020 has sadly proven to be prophetic
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
pfast in our water is not just quote an
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
inconvenience it is a killer responsible
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%

all of these conditions have been linked
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
to pfas exposure

knowing about their presence in the
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
water is a moral and unethical
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
to those who say this creates an undue
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
financial burden on the seller I assure
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
you the cost of chronic illness and
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
cancer is far greater
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
as long as we have pfests in our

environment as long as corporations
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
continue to spew pfas chemicals into our
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
water air and soil we will need to find
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
tools necessary to protect our and our

children's health
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill gives us some protection from
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
exposure to chemicals and substances in
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
our water that that are known to harm us
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge you to support
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 205 and to vote at OTP and
 
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
in order to get a certificate of
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
occupancy for a new home
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
a builder and the installer must provide
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
to the municipality a water test
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
showing a lot of the items that you
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
already have presented here
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
are the 10 000 Wells that were tested of
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
the 250 000 private Wells that's only a
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
four percent sample
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
and if you look at and if you sold
 
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
property either purchased or sold on
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
number five is water supply
 
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
and the and letter e water test has
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
water been tested yes or no date of the
 
01:18:06.179 --> 01:18:07.189 align:start position:0%
water been tested yes or no date of the
test

01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
if yes
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
make an attachment are you aware of the
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
test results of being unsatisfactory
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
with notations yes or no
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
our test results available and what
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
steps were taken to remediate the
 
01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.630 align:start position:0%
steps were taken to remediate the
problem

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
page one of any sales disclosure
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'm also a real estate broker an agent
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
for 35 years so I look at this from the
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
Builder's perspective and the Realtors
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
perspective and working for those buyers
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
what this does with the passage is it
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
places an undue financial burden upon
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
owners who don't already have a problem
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
you're asking 250 000 people to test
 
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
their Wells shouldn't it be the decision
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
of the homeowner
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
when does government come in and say we
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
know best you should do this
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
and it should do this versus shall do
 
01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.169 align:start position:0%
and it should do this versus shall do
this

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
the other question I have for you for
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
on page two rule number six I
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
contaminants common and well water
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
most private wells in New Hampshire
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
provide water containing harmful
 
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.189 align:start position:0%
provide water containing harmful
contaminants

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
so are you telling the 250 000
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire you're Well's
 
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.209 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire you're Well's
contaminated

01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
it's a statement by the state and by
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
policy makers that your water contains
 
01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.290 align:start position:0%
policy makers that your water contains
contaminants

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
you did a 10 000 sample of 250 000
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
that's pretty presumptuous
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
we already do this ladies and gentlemen
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief because you hear from a
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
lot of folks
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
but the New Hampshire Home Builders we
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
provide a water test for new wells we
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
can't get a certificate of occupancy
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
without it
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh don't go away
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to know
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
if we can get a copy of that
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um application that you sent and to the
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
committee members
um

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you you referenced that
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
we already do this this is already in
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
the law and if we could tell me where
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
that is in the law that I could it's not
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
law it's it's practic it's in order to
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
get a certificate of occupancy from a
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
municipality where a new home is being
 
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.110 align:start position:0%
municipality where a new home is being
built

01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
the developer must provide a water test
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
to the municipality in order to get that
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know the law ma'am and I
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
can certainly try to find it
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely Mr chairman approached the
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
chairman with the seller's disclosure
 
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.790 align:start position:0%
chairman with the seller's disclosure
sure

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
actually also if you maybe uh just if
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
you have a copy that you could email to
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the committee on the yeah that would be
 
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I noticed in section six again uh it
 
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
mentions that
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
on line 14 notification notification
 
01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
required well water containments rate uh
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
radon lead
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and they want to amend to add in
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh arsenic mpfest
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
is that an amendment that is not in the
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
existing RSA today do you know
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
I know it's not on the existing selfish
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
disclosure that an agent provides to
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
buyers and sellers to complete us
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
um specifically with those language of
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
pfas is not on there okay so the pfas
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
language I'm sorry just real quick the
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
pfas language is not add on the added on
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
to that specific form that you just
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
handed to the chair correct thank you
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative wrong or question thank
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:30.890 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that well water is
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
already tested before a certificate of
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy can be granted what are the
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
components of that test what what things
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
are tested in that
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
live is dictated by the municipality and
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
I can get that for you right away
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
representative for whatever I don't want
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
to forget one of them so I will get that
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
for you right away okay
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
um is the certificate a follow-up Mr
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you is the
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
um if things during that well testing
 
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
that well water testing
 
01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:08.219 align:start position:0%
um exceed some acceptable level
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
um what happens then to that but what
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
does the Builder do then they mitigate
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
it I'm sorry they would mitigate it okay
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay and can I have one more okay and
 
01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned that
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
um during the course of a property
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
transfer the the seller fills out a
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
disclosure form have there been any
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
instances where a seller misrepresents a
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
condition or states that oh the water's
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
fine it's been tested when it actually
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't been tested and if that's the
 
01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
case what's the process now that the
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
buyer owns the home and discovers that
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
the disclosure was
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
um was was faulty what how long does it
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
what did they have to do and how long
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
does it take to remedy that situation I
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
think that's why God created attorneys
 
01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.649 align:start position:0%
think that's why God created attorneys
oh

01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but what would happen representative
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
in practicality is if I'm representing a
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
buyer okay I've done this for 35 years
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
as if I'm representing the buyer we're
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
still going to get the water tested
 
01:24:08.699 --> 01:24:09.709 align:start position:0%
still going to get the water tested
anyway

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know no matter what says on paper
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
I as a buyer agent where Council my
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
clients get the water tested get the
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
septic tested get all the tests so you
 
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
because water shifts water changes you
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
know sometimes they may have done the
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
test 20 years ago and things have
 
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.010 align:start position:0%
test 20 years ago and things have
changed

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
so it's really you know
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
for professional real estate agents who
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
work on a seller's disclosure
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
we worked to protect those buyers and
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
the sellers it helps everyone but if if
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
a seller lies
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
then that's a whole other legal
 
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.390 align:start position:0%
then that's a whole other legal
situation

01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.199 --> 01:25:03.290 align:start position:0%
 
McGill

01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
McGill
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question so if you
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
do discover
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
um problems with those well tests and
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
you do mitigate them like you mentioned
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
to what standards do you mitigate them
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
say if you discover pfas if you were to
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
discover pfast of the water
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
it would be done within the regulations
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
employment uh Environmental Services Des
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
so whatever they put forward it was to
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
be mitigated to come within those
 
01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.530 align:start position:0%
be mitigated to come within those
standards

01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
for the question for a follow-up
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
so can you can you give an example of
 
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
how that mitigation
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
might be done like a walk us walk us
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
through what sort of things might be put
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
in place to correct a pfas problem if
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
you discovered it in a well if you were
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
required to mitigate pfas in a
 
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
residential well
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in that field I don't
 
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
work in that field so it'd be
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for me to answer because I
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
don't have all the facts and I want to
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
be correct when I talk with you okay the
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
next person up will be speaking to that
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
and it will be uh Mr Kernan so great
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you he can he can tell us all
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
about how to do stuff much better than
 
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:26.930 align:start position:0%
about how to do stuff much better than
me

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
um since you are a licensed uh realtor
 
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
as I understand it
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think you mentioned that this
 
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
this form that's described in you know
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
four or 477 4A is provided to the buyer
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
um and that's the language that's being
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
described here I'm trying to ask the
 
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
same question I asked earlier which is
 
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know section two of that says that
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
if the this statement is not provided
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
then there's no legal ramification
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
um can you describe are you aware of any
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
cases where the for this
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
um sort of notice was not provided and
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
if there's uh you could see any concern
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
where people might be less tempted to
 
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
um provide this notice if it were not uh
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
with the language that as it's laid out
 
01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:21.709 align:start position:0%
with the language that as it's laid out
here

01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
I think representative take another
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
Direction where I think you want to go
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
with him please correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
when you often bought a home through
 
01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
when you often bought a home through
foreclosure

01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
foreclosure
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
for instance ub-handed cellular
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
disclosure that says unknown unknown
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
unknown unknown they know nothing about
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
at that point in time the realtor would
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
say to their client we should get the
 
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
water tested
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
or say to the bank
 
01:27:50.689 --> 01:27:50.699 align:start position:0%
please test the water
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
so there have been times where those
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
things are not completed but they're not
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
filled in
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
so the consumer and to their agent
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
representing them
 
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.870 align:start position:0%
representing them
to

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
mitigate that exposure get the water
 
01:28:08.219 --> 01:28:10.910 align:start position:0%
mitigate that exposure get the water
tested

01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
so it it does come up sir
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
often in foreclosures or bank owned
 
01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.570 align:start position:0%
often in foreclosures or bank owned
properties

01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.830 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
hey

01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing no one
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you chairman
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members have a nice
 
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.629 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members have a nice
day

01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh call uh Brandon Kernan from Des I
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
apologize normally I yeah the the Des
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
person is right up after the uh uh these
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
the presenter of the of the bill that uh
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
I messed up the cards so
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
no problem thank you chairman I'm
 
01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
Brandon Kernan I'm the administrator of
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
the drinking water and groundwater
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau at the Department of
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and I'm here to
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 205 which would as
 
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
we've mentioned
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
um would require that when new wells are
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
constructed that Wells be tested for
 
01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
traditional contaminants and pfas and
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
then when there's real estate
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
transactions that there'd be some
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
foreign language provided to buyers
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
about concerns about water quality and
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
radon you know the department does very
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
much strongly support educating people
 
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.209 align:start position:0%
much strongly support educating people
about

01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:22.219 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
identifying and if necessary mitigating
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants in their air and water I
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's critical
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
um we recognize with this bill though
 
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
where test is required for new wells it
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
does have costs and already to construct
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
a new well and install a pump it costs
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
about 12 to 25 000 and the testing
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
requirements as proposed here could add
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
another four to eight hundred dollars if
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
you do both the traditional contaminants
 
01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
that people generally would look for and
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
then include pfast about two-thirds of
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
that 400 to 800 is associated with the
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
pfast testing it is quite expensive
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know this discussion about costs
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's really a policy question you know
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
we think it's important that people know
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
what they're drinking but you know
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
mandating the cost is something that I
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important to have a
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
discussion about and this very
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
discussion did occur back in 2020 and
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
the house did pass
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 667 after working really
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
hard on the bill with industry and
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
collaborating with various stakeholders
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
to get the language where almost
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
everyone can support it and so it passed
 
01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
the house but unfortunately covid
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
disrupted the legislative session and it
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
never was considered in the Senate and
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why 667 did not go forward
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know pfas is absolutely a serious
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
and difficult issue for New Hampshire
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
especially in the southern part of the
 
01:30:43.129 --> 01:30:43.139 align:start position:0%
state where hundreds of square miles of
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
surface water and groundwater is
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
contaminated due to air emissions it's
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
our population Center the state that's
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
contaminated essentially and they have
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe levels of pfoa above our state
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
standards at this point and the
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
statistics you heard from representative
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
Muse are accurate you know 30 percent
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
exceed our standard and 80 80 86 percent
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
are detectable
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
for that reason and still I believe
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
there's language on page three you know
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
starting at line five that talks about
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
the concern about pfas in the state with
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
an emphasis on Southern Hampshire
 
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
this statement on page three starting
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
line five is completely accurate and is
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
um but this time we don't have resources
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
from the people that made these
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals and caused our groundwater
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
surface water be contaminated to to pay
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
for private well testing I mean these
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
pfas shouldn't be there you know it's
 
01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
very unfair that residents are left with
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
having to deal with the cost of sampling
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
and treating for it but until such time
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
there's resources the sample every well
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
from responsible parties that's where
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
we're at at this point
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
the good news as representative as
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Muse pointed out that if
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
you do sample your well and you find
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
unsafe levels of pfas over our state
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
standards there is a state rebate
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
program to put in treatment for pfast or
 
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
to extend your water if there's an
 
01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
option nearby to a public water system
 
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
so there's a benefit if you do testing
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
there is a remedy in place and resources
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll just point out that if this
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
bill does pass you know as proposed it
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of the Safe
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Act if the testing for
 
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:26.900 align:start position:0%
new wells or this did not occur
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
that enforcement of that of the century
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
Commodore act falls under the Department
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and we could
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
enforce it but to be reactive we
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a Mecca mechanism in place
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
to make sure everyone is getting their
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
Wells tested when there's a new well
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
installed but if we had inquiries or
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
compliant and found that this was not
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
the case we would have finding Authority
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's not usually what we jump to you
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
usually work with an entity first to see
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
if they will make it right and do the
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
work that they well you educate them
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
about the law and then you work with
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
them to get them to complete the work
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
ultimately that doesn't happen there's a
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
range a pretty large range where fines
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
could be administered and you look at
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
things such as the severity of
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
infraction did they know about it ahead
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
of time what was the financial benefit
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
and there's sort of a process you go
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
through to come up Case by case what
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
that actual fine would be and if the
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
party wants to work out something
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
um you know a compromise um to make it
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
right so but it was a long process
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
before wherever we get to finding people
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
really try working with them first
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
um with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
I have first off
 
01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:37.139 align:start position:0%
do you have a a uh any uh documentation
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
any right uh any uh
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
anything to
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
other than the you know we did no
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony or Monday but uh yes okay yeah
 
01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
I know I I realized that usually usually
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
you do pass something out
 
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.830 align:start position:0%
you do pass something out
uh

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
Innovative from and then rep then
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
taking my questions Mr Karen no
 
01:34:03.179 --> 01:34:05.209 align:start position:0%
taking my questions Mr Karen no
currently

01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
um Des does have a I believe it's in
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
statute that they have to inform well
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
owners within a certain radius of a well
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's been found to exceed state pfas
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
mcls is that correct that is correct
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
so if a new well is being drilled and
 
01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.129 align:start position:0%
so if a new well is being drilled and
um

01:34:27.129 --> 01:34:27.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
Diaz would they get notice of that and
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
what happens if that new well that's
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
being drilled Falls within that 500 feet
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
radius of a contaminated well
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
we would not necessarily get that
 
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
information if there was an exceedance
 
01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
unless the homeowner or the pump
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
installer provided it to us the labs
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
don't automatically report exceedances
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
it's sort of private information at this
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
time the way it works someone samples
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
are well but it's provided to us it
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
would go into our our database our
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
online data viewer and that 500 foot
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
notification would kick in at that point
 
01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.510 align:start position:0%
notification would kick in at that point
okay

01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
so if if the well was already there and
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
shown to be contaminated
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
um or if the well was already there
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
within 500 feet DS would take action but
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
they you're saying that DS should not
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
take action on a well that hasn't
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually been drilled yet but is being
 
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
planned to being drilled
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
well ideally when people find elevated
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
levels of contaminants they would share
 
01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:34.139 align:start position:0%
that data with us and many times they do
 
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
and we do act on it but there's not a
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
legal requirement that is you as a
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
private owner sample your well if you
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
have a exceedance you do not have to
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily provide that to us unless
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
you're aware of a release of a chemical
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
or something on your property that was
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
illegal itself but you know spills and
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing are reportable but
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
the actual exceedance would not be
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
mandated to be reported to Des okay just
 
01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
one more final question Mr chair
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so what I understand from your
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
testimony early on you said that you
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
strongly support education and people's
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
awareness of these hazardous substances
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
that may be in a well but that you
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
um don't support the financial impact
 
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill would pose to people
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
because the testing would be
 
01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:24.169 align:start position:0%
because the testing would be
um

01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh four hundred to eight hundred dollars
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
per test do you know how that price
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
compares to someone having to get health
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
treatment for any of the diseases that
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
are caused by pfas or these other
 
01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.649 align:start position:0%
are caused by pfas or these other
elements

01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
elements
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
first of all I didn't mean to come
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
across as not supporting the testing
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
mandate I think the department
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that's a broader policy
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
decision than it should necessarily have
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
a definitive answer on we definitely
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
think all wells should be tested for
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring contaminants and
 
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
pfas the naturally contouring
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
contaminants are kind of all of our own
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility we live in New Hampshire
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
It's associated with your property
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately pfas it's unfair but right
 
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
now the only option really is is for the
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
homeowner to pay for that even though
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's not their fault that it's in the
 
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
water and we don't like that but that's
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
how it is
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that you it would be a
 
01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that you it would be a
reactive

01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
reactive
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
um that responding to the violation
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
would be reactive because you don't for
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
example know
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
um what the testing results would be but
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
um could this language in you know
 
01:37:36.719 --> 01:37:37.490 align:start position:0%
um could this language in you know
um

01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
section five on line six it says
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
provide the report to the property owner
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
could it also provide the report to Des
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
DS also I believe is notified of all
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
Wells that are drilled and then they
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
could correlate the tomb
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes that could be a requirement when a
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
well driller constructs a new well
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
they have to file a well-compression
 
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
report within 90 days so theoretically
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
this could be with that however the law
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
or the bill I'm sorry is proposing the
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
pump installer do the testing which is
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate because you can't test until
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
you have a pump and a pump might be
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
installed you know 120 days or 180 days
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
after the wells installed so you might
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
not be able to make the symbol at the
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
same time but yes you could submit it
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we could merge the two documents
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
together in our files in our database
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:33.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
um I want to follow up on something that
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
representative rung had raised
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and just to clarify for my own
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
knowledge so right now there wouldn't be
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
any grants available to do any of this
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
testing by the
 
01:39:02.410 --> 01:39:02.420 align:start position:0%
um pump installer
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
based in whether
 
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
there might be pfas or other chemicals
 
01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
in the water
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
at this time there's not a Statewide
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
program to test Wells for pfas or
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
traditional contaminants we are sampling
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
every day private Wells or P fast
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
responding to contamination events where
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
we see a private well has an exceedance
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
we draw the 500 Circle do notification
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
with that notification for pfas we're
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
offering the sample to well at no cost
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the homeowner and so that's where
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
it's focused right now and then as
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative Muse pointed out we have
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
a pilot project in the Seacoast where a
 
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
number of Seacoast towns are having
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
private well testing events that pfas is
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
being included where testing can occur
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
at no cost and the goal of that program
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
which was funded by the drinking water
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund is a look at as a
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
pilot program where we'll report back to
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature on how a Statewide
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
program could be stood up to test for
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
both pfas and traditional contaminants
 
01:40:07.090 --> 01:40:07.100 align:start position:0%
you know ideally
 
01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
something like that happened with MTB
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
could occur where eventually responsible
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
parties are brought to bear the costs of
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
the damage they did and pay for the cost
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
of sampling Wells and ideally that's
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we do to address this problem is
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't be in our groundwater
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative harp for our question
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
um prior speaker was asked Can you
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
comment on the methods of a remediation
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
if the well Test shows pfas for a
 
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.070 align:start position:0%
if the well Test shows pfas for a
homeowner

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
01:40:45.169 --> 01:40:45.179 align:start position:0%
yes there's
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
basically three approaches for treating
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
pfast and there'll be more as we go
 
01:40:51.169 --> 01:40:51.179 align:start position:0%
forward because there's a lot of focus
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
on it the most common method if you want
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
to treat all the water in your house so
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
from the well going into your house
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be granule activated carbon and
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
that can cost a few thousand to six
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to remove pfast and all
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the water and then of course you have to
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
maintain it and replace it over time
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
that only removes pfast though and it
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't address the natural contaminants
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
for the most part the metals go right
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
through the carbon
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
another option is just to treat water at
 
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
your kit in the kitchen so you put a
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
little device either in your basement
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
with little hoses that go up to your
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
countertops or underneath your sink and
 
01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
you can treat your kitchen faucet or the
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
refrigerator water and or the
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
refrigerator water with what we call
 
01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
point of view so most of the house
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't have treated water but where you
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
drink the water or use it for cooking is
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
treated and you could do carb in there
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
or reverse osmosis and reverse osmosis
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
only works at that small scale within
 
01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
the kitchen because you waste a lot of
 
01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
water to make clean water but that
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
actually takes care of most of the
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
natural contaminants in addition to
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
pfast so that's a really good choice and
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
that costs generally about a thousand
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
dollars if you pay somebody or if you do
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else oh by the way it's one
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative Darby Roberta first thank
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
you very briefly um so section T
 
01:42:24.169 --> 01:42:24.179 align:start position:0%
um on of the contaminants to be tested
 
01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:27.179 align:start position:0%
for says other per and poly basically
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
pfas that Des finds
 
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:33.260 align:start position:0%
um concerning in the future
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
is is there any concern that that might
 
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
be open-ended and lead to increases in
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
testing costs in the future
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I mean the way it works
 
01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
right now there's two standard methods
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
to test for pfas and depending on if you
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
use one or the other it's you know 25 to
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
say 37 compounds that can be looked for
 
01:42:56.689 --> 01:42:56.699 align:start position:0%
under the two methods and you can save a
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
little bit of money by asking the lab to
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
only report four of this of the whole
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
set but you don't save a lot the labs
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
are set up to run the whole method
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
because that's what and that's what
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're requiring and that's what water
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
systems are often doing so I I think as
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
we find out more about pfas and if we
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
adopt additional standards it'll just
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
work into the process as a matter of
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
adding another chemical standard into
 
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
the analytical process
 
01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
moving whoops
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
moving right along uh supporting the
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
bill Dan Grace from New Hampshire water
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
turn it on there it is uh Dan Grace
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm in the well industry I was active
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 667 when we first put it
 
01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.330 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 667 when we first put it
through

01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm here on behalf of the New
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water well Association which
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
is a membership of all of our peers in
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
the industry I've been an active
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
president for I think eight years so
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
I've gotten a lot of collective
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
information from other folks doing what
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
we do and I guess the whole idea of this
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill really is to just create a standard
 
01:44:22.199 --> 01:44:22.790 align:start position:0%
bill really is to just create a standard
um

01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
as it was talked about earlier that
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
towns municipalities do require water
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
testing but some of those requirements
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
are as low as a coliform uh E coli
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria test and what we've found is
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
many many customers
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
call us and say something's wrong with
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
my water and they don't notice until
 
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
they see aesthetic staining from a
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
secondary like iron or manganese and
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
they say but our water tests passed so
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
when when a lack of better return naive
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
homeowner buys a house and is told their
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
water passed they think it's safe to
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
drink we go in we look for the water
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
test none was collected other than a
 
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
standard bacteria test so we do a
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
complete comprehensive test the 14
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
parameter test that's recommended on
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
and find that there's elevated arsenic
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
uranium radon you know other carcinogens
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
but they were under the safety blanket
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
that their water was safe to drink
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
because it passed the water test that
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
required to see the co
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying around the corners
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
and protect health and and human safety
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
to get more people to test this this 14
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
parameter test the addition to pfas um
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
the association is not uh for at this
 
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.330 align:start position:0%
the association is not uh for at this
point

01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
um we don't feel that the testing is
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
fluent enough
 
01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.590 align:start position:0%
fluent enough
um

01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's a six to eight week lag and
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
getting those results back there's one
 
01:45:40.689 --> 01:45:40.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lab that does the testing
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of these samples are overnighted
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
um after collection to get to outsourced
 
01:45:46.619 --> 01:45:47.930 align:start position:0%
um after collection to get to outsourced
Labs

01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
Labs
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
um I I just think there needs to be a
 
01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
refined sense of of testing before we
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
get it locked into a bill so the
 
01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
association is in favor of of this bill
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
house 205 but actually removing the
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
pfaster requirement and just using that
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um map that Des has created online as a
 
01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:08.219 align:start position:0%
indicator to recommend to customers
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
where to test water now out of the 10
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
000 Wells that were tested and 87 came
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
back with pfasa I'm not sure where those
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
Wells were tested if they were all
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
tested in the contamination Zone
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
obviously you're going to have a skewed
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
number then if you did it brought across
 
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
the entire State now my office operates
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
from Canadian border all the way down to
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
the mass border we have three locations
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
we've tested a lot for pfas in in those
 
01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:32.900 align:start position:0%
areas and and have really come up with
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
very few indications of of pfas in the
 
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
walls that we've drilled so adding this
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
to every well that we drilled we just
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
saw is cumbersome for the homeowners
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
um it's expensive it's time consuming
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
and we don't know if the technology is
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
there yet we'd like to get this bill
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
through uh you know as as a 14 parameter
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
test just creating a standard for every
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
new well that's drilled in the state so
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
we have something to go on and something
 
01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:57.500 align:start position:0%
to start this off
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.850 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:10.850 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:15.179 align:start position:0%
is it Joanne McIntyre from New Hampshire
 
01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:23.990 align:start position:0%
is it Joanne McIntyre from New Hampshire
Realtors

01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.770 --> 01:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Joni McIntyre I work as
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
a real estate agent for Coldwell Banker
 
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
J Hampe Associates here in Concord and
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm president-elect of the New Hampshire
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors
 
01:47:39.129 --> 01:47:39.139 align:start position:0%
um in the legislation if the legislation
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
if the legislator chooses to move
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
forward with House Bill 205 then
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
Realtors would like to see some changes
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
to the language I'd like to say first of
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
all our goal as a realtor is to inform
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
our clients
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
and not frighten them
 
01:47:58.090 --> 01:47:58.100 align:start position:0%
um the first change on page two line 21
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
related to the changes to RSA 4774a
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
this reads most private Wells I mean
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
most private Wells contain harmful
 
01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.530 align:start position:0%
most private Wells contain harmful
contaminants

01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
Realtors would suggest that this
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
language is altered to private Wells may
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
contain harmful contaminants in our
 
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
discussion with Des as well as our
 
01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
general knowledge
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
with buyers and sellers it is not
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that most private Wells
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
contain harmful contaminants in it's
 
01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:29.699 align:start position:0%
important that we be precise with our
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
language to ensure that our buyers make
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
informed decisions
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
on page 3 line 21 through 23 we strongly
 
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
oppose this this provision
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
when personally when I receive
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
information that contains bold
 
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
capitalized text my understanding is
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
that this highlighted section is the
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
most important data that I've received
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the case in this case it implies that
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
radon lead arsenic's Arsenic and PFS and
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
pfaffs are the most important factors in
 
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the Realtors Supply buyers with ant
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
sellers with five pages of disclosures
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
which you just received and a five-page
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
pns which has currently the the
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
um radon lead arsenic
 
01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
um radon lead arsenic
description

01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
but it also contains language about
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
water sewer air quality
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
um Insurance flood insurance
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
easements covenants just a gazillion
 
01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:41.709 align:start position:0%
easements covenants just a gazillion
things

01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
all of these factors are important some
 
01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
of them are more important than others
 
01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:49.139 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to trivialize
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
trivialize the pfaffs but for some
 
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
people a buyer moving to Hopkinton who
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
has half a dozen chickens the pfas
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
information is important to them
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
but it's really important to them to be
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
in a neighborhood that does not have
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
covenants prohibiting chickens so we
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that there's nothing
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
that says this stuff is more important
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
um because for our buyers there's a
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
myriad of things that are really
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of new p-pass in terms of the
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
new pfas testing requirement in section
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
one of the bill as well as the new pfas
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
notification requirement inserted into
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 477a we will defer to your better
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
judgment however these tests are not
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and Realtors are keenly
 
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
aware of pfaff's contamination in and
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
around Merrimack this testing
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
requirement will be Statewide adding
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
several hundred dollars
 
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
to to a well drill is probably fine for
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
most of us
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
but you should know that it can be a
 
01:50:59.090 --> 01:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
prohibitive burden for some of the
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
residents you need to weigh mandating a
 
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
500 to 700 expense in areas where pfaps
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
may not have been a demonstrated problem
 
01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:10.970 align:start position:0%
may not have been a demonstrated problem
similarly

01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
we are certainly not opposed to new
 
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
pfaff's language in RSA 477a
 
01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:19.729 align:start position:0%
pfaff's language in RSA 477a
however

01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
we do think it's important to remind the
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
that the long longer the notification
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
section becomes the less likely buyers
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
are going to be to read it I don't know
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you've ever heard of tmtr my son sent
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
me that when I send them a long email
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
too much to read and that really does
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
happen I have occasions where where a
 
01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:43.580 align:start position:0%
buyer or even a seller will say to me
 
01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
Joni when is our closing date that is on
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
your that is on your pns and they
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
haven't really read it so we want to be
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
careful not to make those disclosures so
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
long that they don't read them
 
01:51:56.639 --> 01:51:59.290 align:start position:0%
long that they don't read them
um

01:51:59.290 --> 01:51:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
so again we leave it to you to best
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
judge if pfas chemicals pose a similar
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
threat statewise and finally
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
um we would ask that if this does pass
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
it does the it would take effect on 1 1
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
24. this will give us time to inform our
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
members about the change educate them
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
about the issue and incorporate it into
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
our into our forms
 
01:52:26.689 --> 01:52:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh do you have
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
copies of your suggestions uh
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot easier for members of
 
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
this committee to or or anyone to put in
 
01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:36.910 align:start position:0%
this committee to or or anyone to put in
a

01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
amendments if we if we didn't have to
 
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
complement write them all down listening
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
to you can I send them can I email them
 
01:52:48.169 --> 01:52:48.179 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah fine mail uh email it to
 
01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
the committee okay great thank you
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:55.070 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%

01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
that for or against yeah thank you Mr
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee I
 
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
received these comments from the
 
01:53:19.070 --> 01:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
American chemistry Council yesterday so
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit I don't have it all
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
polished for you yet but I will also
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
take that advice of putting this in
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
writing and sending it to the committee
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%

members here in New Hampshire but I will
 
01:53:36.649 --> 01:53:36.659 align:start position:0%
note not saying Cobain they are not a
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%

01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%

01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
we're not focused on the policy being
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
um included or being proposed in this in
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
this bill we're just really looking at
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
the Amendments we'd like to suggest
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
focus on the testing and Reporting on
 
01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:57.179 align:start position:0%
those pfas um for which Des already has
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
um you know through the EPA and through
 
01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
the administrative process that Des has
 
01:54:05.689 --> 01:54:05.699 align:start position:0%
pfas are a very large class of
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
substances with a wide variety of
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
physical and chemical properties and so
 
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
not all pfas are actually the ones that
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
are problematic like we've seen in the
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
various P foa pfas et cetera Etc so I
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
would just make two comments and I'll
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
put this in writing so that you'll have
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
it on page two
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
um line
 
01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:31.820 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a little little paragraph T
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
where the section talks about other per
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
and polyflorically fluorical substances
 
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
for which Des Services establish an MCL
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 45 an ambient groundwater
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
quality standard adopted Persona to 485c
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
we would stop the sentence there the
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
other language about detect and reported
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
to Des and other Wells within the same
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
Community we just want to make sure that
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
the testing and the reporting stays the
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
way that it currently does now through
 
01:55:03.649 --> 01:55:03.659 align:start position:0%
the department that would be our first
 
01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:07.139 align:start position:0%
suggestion our second suggestion would
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
be on page three
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
um line 12. starting with that last
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
sentence all per and polyflorical
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
substances associated with the with the
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
testing method should be reported we
 
01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:25.139 align:start position:0%
would suggest language such as levels of
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
pifoa pfos pfna
 
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
pfhxs and other pfas for which the
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
department has established mcl's
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 45 or ambient ground quarter
 
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standard percent of
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
45C should be reported so we were just
 
01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:42.179 align:start position:0%
kind of like to see the language on
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
testing and Reporting stay with what the
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
department has currently and those are
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
the only suggestions we would make again
 
01:55:49.450 --> 01:55:49.460 align:start position:0%
the policy is up to you
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to put this in
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
writing and send it to you so if you
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee you'll have that to
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
consider thank you is there any
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the uh
 
01:55:59.159 --> 01:56:00.410 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the uh
committee

01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
thank you see you none thank you and
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
good morning morning Sharon renzullo and
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee
 
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
I'm Nancy Murphy from Hillsboro 12. I
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack of a community of
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
about 28 000 people which has been
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
highly impacted by pfas we're currently
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
dealing with an exceedance of kidney
 
01:56:35.050 --> 01:56:35.060 align:start position:0%
cancer cases that are known to be
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
associated with pfas exposure so this
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill isn't particularly important to me
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of HB 205 that I see
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
much like both a consumer protection and
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
an informed consent bill
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
um an additional cost of four to eight
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to include pfas testing
 
01:56:55.970 --> 01:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
I would suggest is money very well spent
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
the cost to individuals and Society to
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
deal with the negative Health impacts
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
associated with these toxic chemicals
 
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
far exceeds that amount
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
I believe new homeowners should receive
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
full disclosure as to what contaminants
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
are present in the well water as
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge is power homeowners who are
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
informed about the levels of pfas in
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
their Wells that will provide their
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water will help protect
 
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families from the
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
health impacts known to be associated
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
with these toxic chemicals
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
three quarters of a small amount of of
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
private Wells tested thus far showed the
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
presence of pfas and about a third of
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
them have pfas levels that exceed
 
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
current state standards we must keep in
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
mind that current New Hampshire pfas
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
mcls far exceed that which would be
 
01:57:46.129 --> 01:57:46.139 align:start position:0%
reflective of the epa's recently
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
released recommendations regarding
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
levels that are considered quote safe
 
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
and that Health advisory level for at
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
least one of those chemicals is four
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
parts per quadrillion which is pretty
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
it's less far less than one I'm
 
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
supportive of any Amendment um that
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
would make be more specific to the
 
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
negative Health impacts of arsenic radon
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
and Lead as though I know in Merrimack
 
01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
we too have elevated lead levels in our
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
Public Schools whether that's through
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
faucets pipes or whatever it's important
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
for people to know because of the health
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
impacts of that as well
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to say that um no
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
pfas and we have no other at least 12
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
000 of them right now
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
um no pfest have been determined safe so
 
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
I think any suggestion that they are
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
safe or we only have to worry about some
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
um it would would be of great concern to
 
01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.030 align:start position:0%
um it would would be of great concern to
me

01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I would also suggest that we remember
 
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
that the American chemistry Council uh
 
01:58:49.129 --> 01:58:49.139 align:start position:0%
represents the manufacturers of pfest
 
01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
um Statewide assistance is available
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
right now for reimbursement to uh well
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
owners that meet the Criterion which is
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
the exceedance of of mcls and other
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
things so
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
um it's you know having a um that rebate
 
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
to help install filtration if you find
 
01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:09.659 align:start position:0%
that your uh your drinking water exceeds
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
the current mcls is certainly a benefit
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your time and attention
 
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
and I ever urge you to vote OTP on HB
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
205 thank you thank you any questions by
 
01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's it for the uh
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
or with pink cards
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
I will close the hearing on
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'll spill 205.
 
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing on House Bill 214.
 
01:59:47.209 --> 01:59:47.219 align:start position:0%
relative to limitations on the
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
designation of a portion of the
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I will be
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
submitting my my pink card for the
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
Rosemary rung from Hillsborough 12 which
 
02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
is the town of Merrimack
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
um last year I happened upon a work
 
02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
Committee of uh resources and learned
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
the of the need to
 
02:00:30.649 --> 02:00:30.659 align:start position:0%
amend or modify a current statute which
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
um presently puts a lot of restrictions
 
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
on water removal from the Merrimack
 
02:00:39.890 --> 02:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
river and when that statute was first
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
drafted it its intent was to protect the
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
water from unnecessary withdrawals and
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
just uh to you uh establish that as a
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
protection of the river but we've since
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
learned that those restrictions hamper
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
the flexibility of communities to
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
respond to water quality issues that
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
that they may encounter and I'll bring
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
up pfas as one example and the
 
02:01:10.689 --> 02:01:10.699 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
02:01:14.689 --> 02:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
asked for this this bill so that it
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
gives them more flexibility to respond
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
to water quality issues that may require
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from the river as you'll hear
 
02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:24.020 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
this bill will not affect and and will
 
02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
not create any risk or damage to the
 
02:01:32.209 --> 02:01:32.219 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River it's just to give the
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
department more flexibility in being
 
02:01:35.890 --> 02:01:35.900 align:start position:0%
able to address
 
02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
and be able to provide for any instances
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
that come up that will require
 
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawal to ensure the health and
 
02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:45.260 align:start position:0%
safety of the public
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
I am not going to accept any questions
 
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
on this because I know that Mr Ted deers
 
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
is here from Des and he's the expert on
 
02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
that so if you do have any questions if
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair committee
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ted dears I'm
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
the assistant director of The Water
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
Division at the New Hampshire Department
 
02:02:30.589 --> 02:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and uh it's a
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be here with you this
 
02:02:34.609 --> 02:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
morning still morning uh this afternoon
 
02:02:34.619 --> 02:02:36.770 align:start position:0%
morning still morning uh this afternoon
sorry

02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm uh I'm the one who's sitting
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch so I'm not going
 
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
to say a whole lot of words
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
um except to thank uh representative
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
wrong I think she uh
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
she introduced this bill perfectly uh it
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
leads us into where this bill is really
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
headed what I would like to do is to
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
spend just
 
02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
a couple seconds talking about the
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
rivers management and protection program
 
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
before I jump in
 
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh the rivers management Protection
 
02:03:05.290 --> 02:03:05.300 align:start position:0%
Program has been around since about 1998
 
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
1988 and it has
 
02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
um what it does is it sets up a local
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
process for people to nominate Rivers
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
for the special factors that that that
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
really make those uh the characteristics
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
that make those Rivers special
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
and so this has happened on 19 rivers
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
around the state and when that happens
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
they create a local advisory committee
 
02:03:35.089 --> 02:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
which serves as the eyes and ears for
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
Des in their communities
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
they are they're afforded a certain
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
number of new protections on those
 
02:03:45.169 --> 02:03:45.179 align:start position:0%
particular bodies of water
 
02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
and it opens up a dialogue between the
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
local folks who really care about these
 
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
rivers and the state uh both from a
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
resource perspective as well as from a
 
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
regulatory perspective
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
so it's been a great program it's been
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
very successful over the years
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I have uh that I'll pass out to you
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
here in a second some a little bit of a
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
little graphic that's sort of a by the
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
Numbers kind of graphic that I think it
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
illustrates well the success of this
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.649 --> 02:04:18.659 align:start position:0%
this language that you see in front of
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
you in House Bill 214
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
was the original language that
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
designated the Merrimack river which is
 
02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
one of the first five rivers into the
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
program uh the lower Merrimack river in
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
this case uh in 1990
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
at that time and and I started working
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
on in-stream Flow and River protection
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
issues not long after this time
 
02:04:47.089 --> 02:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
at that time there was concern about the
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
quantity of water in the Merrimack River
 
02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
there was an EPA initiative that was
 
02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:53.219 align:start position:0%
going on at the time that was really
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
looking at sort of this Bi-State river
 
02:04:57.609 --> 02:04:57.619 align:start position:0%
that we have it starts in New Hampshire
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
and and ends in Massachusetts
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of concern about
 
02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
water quantity and what was going to
 
02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
happen over time with increasing
 
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.229 align:start position:0%
happen over time with increasing
population

02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
the forecasts uh for growth the forecast
 
02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
for how much water would be consumed all
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
of that was pointing towards potential
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
problems in the future
 
02:05:22.129 --> 02:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
so when they initially went through and
 
02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
did this designation there was concern
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
about the the water withdrawals that
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
pennichuck was doing in the lower part
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
of the Merrimack that provide water to
 
02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:33.179 align:start position:0%
their service area which includes you
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
know areas around Nashville that that
 
02:05:34.679 --> 02:05:37.129 align:start position:0%
know areas around Nashville that that
part

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
so this language was put in and this was
 
02:05:43.129 --> 02:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
long before uh the state had figured out
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
kind of how are we going to address
 
02:05:47.330 --> 02:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
water withdrawals from surface waters
 
02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to do that in a way
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
that won't dewater rivers and and lets
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
us be able to have a sustainable system
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
over time our
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
program the river's protect Protection
 
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
Program the in-stream flow program the
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
water quality certification program all
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
of these are approaches at DES
 
02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:11.219 align:start position:0%
which allow us to have considerable more
 
02:06:14.570 --> 02:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
sophistication than we had in 1990 as to
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
how we look at Water withdrawals
 
02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
we now have adequate we believe that we
 
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
have adequate
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
process adequate ability for the public
 
02:06:28.609 --> 02:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
to have input and adequate science to be
 
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
able to dress issues wherever they form
 
02:06:34.850 --> 02:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative wrong also mentioned the
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
challenges with water supply in the
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
the challenges of mtbe and pfas just
 
02:06:46.129 --> 02:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
some towns have unfortunate geology they
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
just don't have the kind of water they
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
need to support their their population
 
02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
all of this points towards this
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
regionalization that's going on which is
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
tremendously exciting one of the most
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
exciting things that's happened in water
 
02:07:00.649 --> 02:07:00.659 align:start position:0%
in a long time here in New Hampshire
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to regionalize and to
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
be able to make sure that people have
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
the water where they need it clean water
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
so what we'd like this book really comes
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
out of a bill that happened in the last
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
session uh in which
 
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
um the bill did not go forward but
 
02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
this conversation came up and there
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't time in the last session to
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
address this issue but I think that
 
02:07:26.330 --> 02:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
there was consensus around the committee
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
that this was an important thing to do
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's the
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
flexibility to for the future to ensure
 
02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
that we have adequate water supply when
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
we need it and where we need it
 
02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to stop there and just see
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
if people have any questions and
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
um I have written testimony and
 
02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I left it on my printer
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
and my printer would not fit in my car
 
02:07:53.209 --> 02:07:53.219 align:start position:0%
so I was unable to bring it with me but
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
I will uh you've been it's been emailed
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
to you and I will bring over uh copies
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
for you to have next time you meet so
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
02:08:03.410 --> 02:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
might have
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions by members of
 
02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:08:12.649 --> 02:08:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh I'll I'll allow it because you
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
actually were just putting it in for him
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair normal conditions
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't okay thank you no I just want
 
02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:21.169 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't okay thank you no I just want
to

02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:22.609 --> 02:08:22.619 align:start position:0%
um bring to the attention of the
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
committee that I do believe that we did
 
02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
receive a letter from commissioner
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
Robert Scott supporting this bill
 
02:08:44.089 --> 02:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
or a question
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman brief super brief
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
question representative wrong mentioned
 
02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:54.109 align:start position:0%
question representative wrong mentioned
that

02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
um you know the the limit on the amount
 
02:08:59.810 --> 02:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
of water that could be withdrawn
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
um affected um how to respond to water
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
quality issues and I was wondering if
 
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
you could give us some examples of that
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think
 
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I'm sorry I can't I
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
can't I'm going to back up just a little
 
02:09:15.649 --> 02:09:15.659 align:start position:0%
bit and see if I can actually see you as
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm answering your question
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
I I think one of the again this sort of
 
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
I want to point towards the southern uh
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
the sort of Southern New Hampshire Water
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
Project that's brought water down from
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester down uh all the way into
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
Salem and and throughout that that lower
 
02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.709 align:start position:0%
Salem and and throughout that that lower
area

02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
the one of the reasons for that was the
 
02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
failure of wells and again some some
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
what I call unfortunate geology uh is
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of communities
 
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
that just don't have kind of good access
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
to good volumes of water
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
so so as we've looked at those
 
02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.070 align:start position:0%
so so as we've looked at those
opportunities

02:09:55.070 --> 02:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
02:09:57.649 --> 02:09:57.659 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of different ways in
 
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
which that can manifest itself as
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
different communities want to try to
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
improve their water supply join in on
 
02:10:08.089 --> 02:10:08.099 align:start position:0%
some of these Regional approaches
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
we all are familiar at this point with
 
02:10:15.649 --> 02:10:15.659 align:start position:0%
the challenges of of pfas in places like
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
Merrimack in places like Litchfield
 
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the southern part of
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
that Southern Tier
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
that could eventually it may become more
 
02:10:29.209 --> 02:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
cost effective to actually hook some of
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
those communities and smaller water
 
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
systems and individual uh you know
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
streets up to public water supplies for
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
places you just heard a bill on on
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
private Wells so you know that's a place
 
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
in which you if you had a whole bunch of
 
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
private wells in a certain area you
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
might want to try to plumb all that
 
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
in order to do that you would may need
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
additional water supply
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
so the way we kind of look at this is
 
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
that that may be an opportunity that you
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
might want to reach towards surface
 
02:11:03.169 --> 02:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
waters in order to provide some of that
 
02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:06.380 align:start position:0%
water supply to to those future
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
expansions of those systems that will
 
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
deal with things like pfas and other
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
problems in them so we can't imagine
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
today exactly what that looks like
 
02:11:21.770 --> 02:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
we know that the the pennichuck right
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
now is is withdrawing somewhere between
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know eight and and 15 or so million
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
gallons a day out of the Merrimack so
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
they don't even they're not bumping up
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
against this as a limit today
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
but there's no other legislation like
 
02:11:40.209 --> 02:11:40.219 align:start position:0%
this that I'm aware of in state law
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is is to remember
 
02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
that these aren't necessarily what we
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
call consumptive losses
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
so when you're taking water out of a
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
river you're using it you're treating it
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
you're putting it back in the river
 
02:11:57.890 --> 02:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
you're not consuming all of that water
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
are there losses sure some of those
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
losses are to groundwater which
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
eventually makes it back to the
 
02:12:04.609 --> 02:12:04.619 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River anyway
 
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
um even if it's going to septic systems
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's still making its way into the into
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
the whole Regional water system uh
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's bringing that water back to
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
whence it came
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
so this this idea that somehow you would
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
sort of put this arbitrary limit which
 
02:12:22.609 --> 02:12:22.619 align:start position:0%
is completely arbitrary
 
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
um on one particular water supply in one
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
particular location given what we know
 
02:12:27.599 --> 02:12:28.970 align:start position:0%
particular location given what we know
today

02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:29.810 align:start position:0%
today
um

02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
it seems odd
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
does that does did I get to the point of
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
your question I'm sorry if I wandered
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
around too much yeah that was perfect
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:43.550 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
you all very much have a good day I have
 
02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
no other pink cards uh no one wish to
 
02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
speak otherwise I will declare
 
02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing on how speed house bill
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
214 as a jerk has has ended and that's
 
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
it for lunch you know I'll have uh we'll
 
02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:09.669 align:start position:0%
it for lunch you know I'll have uh we'll
we'll

02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:13:14.209 --> 02:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
be meeting at one o'clock
 
02:13:17.089 --> 02:13:17.099 align:start position:0%
where we will resume
 
03:04:00.290 --> 03:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:02.269 --> 03:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you members
 
03:04:03.889 --> 03:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm happy to be with
 
03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
you all this afternoon and hope you had
 
03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
a great lunch
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Jessica Grill
 
03:04:11.570 --> 03:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm introducing this bill on behalf
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
of Kat McGee
 
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill was filed in response to a
 
03:04:18.290 --> 03:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
constituent's concern that New Hampshire
 
03:04:20.090 --> 03:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
was not paying attention to adequate
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
water supply in sight planning for new
 
03:04:24.830 --> 03:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
housing developments as a member of the
 
03:04:27.290 --> 03:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
Hollis Zoning Board of adjustments
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
um Kat McGee's concerns have been proven
 
03:04:33.349 --> 03:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
correct unfortunately and HB 310 seeks
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
to remedy this oversight
 
03:04:37.849 --> 03:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
water has long been a commodity that
 
03:04:39.769 --> 03:04:39.779 align:start position:0%
we've been able to take for granted and
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
sadly this is no longer the case in New
 
03:04:44.210 --> 03:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in many instances even in a
 
03:04:46.250 --> 03:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
state as rich as water as New Hampshire
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
we're seeing water tables evaporating
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
and great ponds with their first ever
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
algae blooms due to warming conditions
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
we were surprised to learn that there is
 
03:04:58.730 --> 03:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
no requirement on the state level for a
 
03:05:00.590 --> 03:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
certified hydrologist to be engaged in
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
confirming whether a site is capable of
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
providing adequate water to new homes
 
03:05:07.550 --> 03:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
yet this very essential characteristic
 
03:05:09.650 --> 03:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
of housing affects the sale and resale
 
03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
value of properties as well as the
 
03:05:13.790 --> 03:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
habitability of the property
 
03:05:15.290 --> 03:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
I believe you'll be hearing some
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
examples today as of how residents and
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
surrounding neighborhoods are also
 
03:05:22.250 --> 03:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
affected when insufficient planning is
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
done to address the water supply in a
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
given area
 
03:05:27.650 --> 03:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
our initial request
 
03:05:29.389 --> 03:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
um from this constituent took us through
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
a few twists and turns we were lucky to
 
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
receive Insight from Brandon Kernan of
 
03:05:36.530 --> 03:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:05:38.450 --> 03:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
Water Division
 
03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
um providing some information about the
 
03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
history of this topic in New Hampshire
 
03:05:45.290 --> 03:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
he is a professional hydrologist and has
 
03:05:48.290 --> 03:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
deep knowledge of Prior State efforts
 
03:05:50.330 --> 03:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
and had a great understanding of where
 
03:05:52.490 --> 03:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate remedies can be applied in
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
03:05:57.170 --> 03:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
for example OLS chose the conveyance of
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
Realty statute to make these requested
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
changes but the Department of
 
03:06:02.990 --> 03:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services says that a
 
03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
requirement to include water planning
 
03:06:06.889 --> 03:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
and a site plan would more likely be
 
03:06:08.389 --> 03:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
made under Public Safety and land use
 
03:06:08.399 --> 03:06:10.130 align:start position:0%
made under Public Safety and land use
regulations

03:06:10.130 --> 03:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
um with this being said
 
03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
um with this being said
um

03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:16.370 --> 03:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
this bill might need amending for that
 
03:06:20.090 --> 03:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
reason and we ask that the resources
 
03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
committee consider forming a working
 
03:06:24.050 --> 03:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
group to secure additional input from
 
03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:27.769 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
um

03:06:27.769 --> 03:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
to get an update on the books as
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
um how the need for housing stock
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
increases and developers seek to meet
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
that need
 
03:06:37.610 --> 03:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
we were unable to secure an amendment
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
prior to representative McGee going on
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
medical leave but we would also like to
 
03:06:44.210 --> 03:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
request that if the committee does
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
decide to advance the bill as is
 
03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:47.450 align:start position:0%
decide to advance the bill as is
um

03:06:47.450 --> 03:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
that it modified line four to read
 
03:06:52.010 --> 03:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
developers planning to build more than
 
03:06:53.929 --> 03:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
four houses shall include in their site
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
plan a water capacity plan for the area
 
03:06:58.730 --> 03:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
that takes into consideration
 
03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
the information from the analysis would
 
03:07:02.929 --> 03:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
still be in the hands of local planning
 
03:07:04.849 --> 03:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
boards to do with what they decide at
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
the local level so this does not impact
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
any of the municipal actions that would
 
03:07:12.290 --> 03:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
be taken however this bill requires that
 
03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
that information be secured so that it
 
03:07:15.710 --> 03:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
is available for review
 
03:07:18.889 --> 03:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.570 --> 03:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
questions by any members of the
 
03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:23.950 align:start position:0%
questions by any members of the
committee

03:07:23.950 --> 03:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:26.090 --> 03:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh chair recognizes
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh Robert Clegg representing the New
 
03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:07:49.969 --> 03:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Robert Clegg I'm
 
03:07:51.130 --> 03:07:51.140 align:start position:0%
not only
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
representing the home builders I'm also
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
a member
 
03:07:56.210 --> 03:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a developer
 
03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
and what I can say that first thoughts
 
03:07:59.809 --> 03:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
on this bill is
 
03:08:02.510 --> 03:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
if you pass this there'll be no more
 
03:08:04.849 --> 03:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing the cost of a
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
hydrologist and whether or not the
 
03:08:08.990 --> 03:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
information is correct
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
is far too much to ever be able to
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
develop and produce Workforce housing
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
we'll tell you that the other problem
 
03:08:19.610 --> 03:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
you would have is every developer would
 
03:08:20.690 --> 03:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
go in
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
chop up the Lots check aboard them so
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
03:08:28.250 --> 03:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
not have to deal with the four Lots if
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
you look up at what happened at the
 
03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
Lakes from Winnipesaukee Squam Lake
 
03:08:33.530 --> 03:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happened they check
 
03:08:34.849 --> 03:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
about it everything
 
03:08:36.410 --> 03:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
so you're not going to be able to do it
 
03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
because people want to be able to to
 
03:08:39.710 --> 03:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
afford a house
 
03:08:42.110 --> 03:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
Builders want to build them but if you
 
03:08:44.330 --> 03:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
put something like this in place
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
can't afford it it's gotten to the point
 
03:08:48.290 --> 03:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
where we can't really afford to do the
 
03:08:50.929 --> 03:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
houses an affordable house ended up
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
being five hundred thousand dollars
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
because of all the increases in fees
 
03:08:59.330 --> 03:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
in in in in materials
 
03:09:02.030 --> 03:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
and in things that the local towns asked
 
03:09:05.389 --> 03:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
you to do such as school roads and
 
03:09:07.309 --> 03:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
things that they never do
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that I know for a fact
 
03:09:12.170 --> 03:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
that the water level can be changed
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
simply by taking out a beaver dam
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
if the beaver dam is not on your
 
03:09:17.929 --> 03:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
property there's nothing you can do
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to do it
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
and within three years you will find
 
03:09:25.309 --> 03:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
what used to be wet is not
 
03:09:28.490 --> 03:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
I've also seen water flow change
 
03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
by the simple use of dynamite
 
03:09:32.929 --> 03:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
I've seen a well that was called the
 
03:09:34.250 --> 03:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
live well
 
03:09:36.650 --> 03:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
and the guy across the street blasted
 
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
for his foundation
 
03:09:41.210 --> 03:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
and that live wall now ended at his lot
 
03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
and that water never came across the
 
03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:44.510 align:start position:0%
and that water never came across the
street

03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
street
 
03:09:46.370 --> 03:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing a report can really
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
tell you and there's nothing a report
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
can show you that yes okay there's
 
03:09:52.130 --> 03:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
enough water for everybody and then
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
somebody puts in a garden
 
03:09:56.929 --> 03:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
and starts using an excessive amount of
 
03:09:56.939 --> 03:09:58.490 align:start position:0%
and starts using an excessive amount of
water

03:09:58.490 --> 03:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
so all of those things change
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
most of us see this as nothing more than
 
03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
a measure
 
03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
in towns that don't want a lot of
 
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing
 
03:10:10.130 --> 03:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's a way to keep it out because if
 
03:10:13.910 --> 03:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
this was in my town we wouldn't build
 
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
if it was in Hollis we wouldn't build
 
03:10:18.410 --> 03:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
I guarantee you Nash was not going to
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
adopt anything like this because Nashua
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
actually wants us
 
03:10:25.490 --> 03:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
to build housing that people can afford
 
03:10:28.490 --> 03:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
this will take that away
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
is as I said
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a developer and I've been doing
 
03:10:37.730 --> 03:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
building since I was 15. I'm 68.
 
03:10:39.530 --> 03:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
so I've been in it a long time and I can
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
tell you some things work some things
 
03:10:44.090 --> 03:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
don't this will never work nobody will
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
ever comply but people like me aren't
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
going to bother to try to subvert the
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
entire law by by only building three
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
lots and selling the next lots to my
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
kids and then building three more it
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
just it's not worth my time anymore but
 
03:11:01.010 --> 03:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
I know that if you want to start housing
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
the people that we need to fill the work
 
03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:04.010 align:start position:0%
the people that we need to fill the work
positions

03:11:04.010 --> 03:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
don't do this
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you questions by any members of
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative harp
 
03:11:16.730 --> 03:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
03:11:19.250 --> 03:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the cost would be too
 
03:11:21.650 --> 03:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
much what is the average cost for a
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
hydrologist test
 
03:11:25.309 --> 03:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
as far as we know we can't get anybody
 
03:11:27.050 --> 03:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
for less than fifteen thousand dollars
 
03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
to even look at the project
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's what our our
 
03:11:34.010 --> 03:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
initial search is set
 
03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
and they're not guaranteeing that it
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
would go it would depend on how much
 
03:11:39.050 --> 03:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
detail they would actually have to put
 
03:11:41.570 --> 03:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
and they also said that they'll offer no
 
03:11:44.809 --> 03:11:44.819 align:start position:0%
guarantees so if I take their report and
 
03:11:47.090 --> 03:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
I say here's what it is the question
 
03:11:48.650 --> 03:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
then becomes according to my insurance
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
agent are you responsible if the
 
03:11:56.269 --> 03:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:04.010 --> 03:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
seeing no one thank you very much
 
03:12:08.630 --> 03:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh chair calls uh Brandon Kernan
 
03:12:21.230 --> 03:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Brandon Kernan the
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
ministrator of the drinking water and
 
03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau at the Department of
 
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
um here's testify on House Bill 310
 
03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
which would require two things one that
 
03:12:34.730 --> 03:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
if you have a subdivision more than it's
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
gonna have more than four homes that you
 
03:12:38.570 --> 03:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
complete a hydrologic analysis ensure
 
03:12:40.849 --> 03:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
there's an adequate water supply and
 
03:12:42.650 --> 03:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
then two that you also assess for the
 
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
occurrence of pfas we just talked about
 
03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in House Bill 205
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
we department does have concerns with
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed but we do recognize
 
03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
that this topic is important and this is
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to sort of discuss and
 
03:12:59.809 --> 03:12:59.819 align:start position:0%
collaborate with stakeholders on how we
 
03:13:01.490 --> 03:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
can address concerns where there are
 
03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:02.510 align:start position:0%
can address concerns where there are
some

03:13:02.510 --> 03:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
our comments on the bill are on the back
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the testimony letter that I just
 
03:13:09.889 --> 03:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
passed out are
 
03:13:12.170 --> 03:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
before we got to this hearing we did
 
03:13:14.330 --> 03:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
engage with the sponsor and provided a
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
pretty detailed email on how we see the
 
03:13:20.570 --> 03:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
concern about new development and
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
adequate water supply could be addressed
 
03:13:25.969 --> 03:13:25.979 align:start position:0%
and so we have a very detailed email
 
03:13:29.090 --> 03:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
even with a model regulation that we
 
03:13:30.349 --> 03:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
were able to provide the sponsor it's
 
03:13:31.550 --> 03:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
not included but I'm happy to forward
 
03:13:33.469 --> 03:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
that email to anyone that's interested
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have so much work on
 
03:13:37.490 --> 03:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
this topic is about 12 years ago the
 
03:13:39.530 --> 03:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
legislative groundwater commission which
 
03:13:41.929 --> 03:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
was in place from about 2002 to 2010
 
03:13:44.210 --> 03:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at this like what's the
 
03:13:46.010 --> 03:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
what's the impact of lots of private
 
03:13:49.010 --> 03:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
Wells on the area water supply and what
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
can be done and what the commission
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
found back then not the es for the
 
03:13:54.530 --> 03:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
commission was that to a large degree
 
03:13:58.250 --> 03:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
existing local not State subdivision and
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
site plan review authorities would allow
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
municipality would enable them to
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
address concerns if they had them and
 
03:14:06.769 --> 03:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
then the commission went on to look at
 
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
the statute and how it could be tweaked
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
to even clarify that more and so that's
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
the nature of the email that I provided
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor a very detailed analysis of
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
those existing land use statutes and
 
03:14:20.090 --> 03:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
where tweaks could be made to clarify it
 
03:14:23.510 --> 03:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know we do agree that any effort to
 
03:14:25.250 --> 03:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
address this topic belongs under land
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
use planning or public health and some
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
towns are already doing that requiring
 
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
studies where they have concerns
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
in our experience Statewide and I've
 
03:14:35.690 --> 03:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
been with the state for 23 years I'm
 
03:14:37.370 --> 03:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
only aware of a few instances where
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a development in a very
 
03:14:41.570 --> 03:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
localized area town so not town-wide a
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
very localized area where you had a
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
clusters of homes that had a water
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
quality or quantity problem you know
 
03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
three to five times I can think about
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
that occurring and so it's important
 
03:14:53.150 --> 03:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
that you know towns being able to do
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
this but have a basis for doing it for
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
certain areas of town because as Senator
 
03:14:59.570 --> 03:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
cleggs mentioned
 
03:15:01.969 --> 03:15:01.979 align:start position:0%
it is a costly study and you would see
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that if you see the model regulation the
 
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
groundwater commission developed um
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
to do a meaningful hydrogeo study to see
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
if you have a valuable water supply you
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
actually have to go and drill Wells and
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
pump them and see how multiple Wells
 
03:15:15.610 --> 03:15:15.620 align:start position:0%
that you might use in the future
 
03:15:18.050 --> 03:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
interact with each other and what their
 
03:15:19.370 --> 03:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
yields are if they're sustainable
 
03:15:21.889 --> 03:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
there's no amount of desktop study that
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
could tell you you know if there's
 
03:15:25.849 --> 03:15:25.859 align:start position:0%
adequate water supply in a given area so
 
03:15:27.290 --> 03:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
it is important that this is able to be
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
done where needed but not State
 
03:15:29.279 --> 03:15:31.070 align:start position:0%
done where needed but not State
Statewide

03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
you know relative to pfas I think for
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
the most part I can reference my
 
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
testimony in hospital 205 to save time
 
03:15:40.730 --> 03:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's a serious issue it's an important
 
03:15:42.889 --> 03:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
issue for the state and some of the
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
education or possibly testing
 
03:15:46.730 --> 03:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
requirements depending which way the
 
03:15:48.410 --> 03:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
committee wants to go would be probably
 
03:15:50.210 --> 03:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
the way to address that versus require
 
03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
an upfront study
 
03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
for this bill I'd be happy to answer any
 
03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:57.730 align:start position:0%
for this bill I'd be happy to answer any
questions

03:15:57.730 --> 03:15:57.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:16:01.490 --> 03:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
any any questions by representative
 
03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:02.690 align:start position:0%
any any questions by representative

03:16:02.690 --> 03:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
Darby
 
03:16:04.190 --> 03:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um do you know if
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is a rule in place that allows
 
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities to require this um prior
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
to you know provide you know issuing a
 
03:16:17.050 --> 03:16:17.060 align:start position:0%
building permit
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're aware of
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
examples where towns have used their
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
subdivision Authority or site plan
 
03:16:25.250 --> 03:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
review regulations to build in
 
03:16:27.530 --> 03:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
requirements for water supply studies to
 
03:16:29.570 --> 03:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
make sure the proposed land use is
 
03:16:31.849 --> 03:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
compatible with the proposed development
 
03:16:33.650 --> 03:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
generally they have a basis for that
 
03:16:35.330 --> 03:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
regulation usually in their master plan
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
where they've identified an area that
 
03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
might warrant that it's just not a
 
03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
trivial thing that's required by
 
03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
everybody but if you have it's usually a
 
03:16:45.050 --> 03:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
hillside development one Hill that has
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
lots of homes on it that might have
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
untreatable water the iron so high or
 
03:16:52.010 --> 03:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
you may not have viable quantity but
 
03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
again those are very few circumstances
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
but those that's what I'm aware of at
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
this point and then again the email I
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
could send you which is a lot of
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
information shows the statutes
 
03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
highlights where we think the authority
 
03:17:06.110 --> 03:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
is but then also shows where you could
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
clarify it more if you wanted to do so
 
03:17:12.170 --> 03:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
I think that'd be great thank you
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
any uh any other questions by members of
 
03:17:17.750 --> 03:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:17:20.690 --> 03:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
oh oh bye hey
 
03:17:22.210 --> 03:17:22.220 align:start position:0%
I know you
 
03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative healing
 
03:17:26.510 --> 03:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
the only question I have is that it uh
 
03:17:28.010 --> 03:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
we found out it was very costly again
 
03:17:29.210 --> 03:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
you said you had to draw quite well
 
03:17:32.090 --> 03:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
what's the time frame on a study like
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
and you know I think I mean
 
03:17:39.170 --> 03:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
theoretically it could be done in a
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
month or practically speaking you're
 
03:17:42.590 --> 03:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
probably talking six to nine months to
 
03:17:46.190 --> 03:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
to line up contractors have site layouts
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
or where Wells would go drill the wells
 
03:17:51.230 --> 03:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
temporarily set them up with pumps do
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
the pumping work collect the data
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
process the data and write the report
 
03:17:57.410 --> 03:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
yeah those things tend to take over
 
03:17:58.910 --> 03:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
several months even though theoretically
 
03:18:00.050 --> 03:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
it could be done in a short period of
 
03:18:00.060 --> 03:18:01.690 align:start position:0%
it could be done in a short period of
time

03:18:01.690 --> 03:18:01.700 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
take any other questions from members of
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I have one uh
 
03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Clegg uh put uh mentioned a cost
 
03:18:15.769 --> 03:18:15.779 align:start position:0%
associated with doing uh
 
03:18:19.969 --> 03:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
with doing this kind of study is what he
 
03:18:21.309 --> 03:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
said is that
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
within the ballpark it says he said
 
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand or something like that
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
I actually think it could be quite a bit
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
higher especially because it could
 
03:18:31.969 --> 03:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
involve half in the drill the wells out
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
of time which might be costs that you
 
03:18:35.450 --> 03:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
spend later on if you go ahead with the
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
development but it would be cost that
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
would be sunk if you didn't okay 2012 be
 
03:18:42.530 --> 03:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
12 to 25 000 you'd maybe drill half the
 
03:18:45.190 --> 03:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
wells to test them and then
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists would probably build out
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
a hundred and fifty dollars an hour and
 
03:18:50.210 --> 03:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
then you'd have to have the temporary
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
pumps installed and people manning the
 
03:18:54.050 --> 03:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
pump test and measuring so I think it
 
03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
could be fifty hundred thousand dollars
 
03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:57.830 align:start position:0%
could be fifty hundred thousand dollars
potentially

03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
to do field work some towns have done a
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
desktop study where you draw a circle
 
03:19:04.130 --> 03:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
and say this is how much rain you get
 
03:19:05.450 --> 03:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
this is how much water is going to be
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
taken and here's the water budget but
 
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't tell you how the
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
water occurs underground and if the
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
wells will be viable and interact in a
 
03:19:16.370 --> 03:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
in a contentious way with one another
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:26.650 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
a

03:19:26.650 --> 03:19:26.660 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:19:29.570 --> 03:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
representing a representative
 
03:19:31.610 --> 03:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand you correctly in
 
03:19:35.389 --> 03:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
your view in the Department's view many
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the aspects in this bill are
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
addressed in other bills the pfas item
 
03:19:44.809 --> 03:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
the pfas item is certainly addressed in
 
03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
205 where it would you either require
 
03:19:50.330 --> 03:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
testing or at least educate about the
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
importance of testing that could address
 
03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
the occurrence part of it as far as
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
water quantity we think existing law
 
03:19:59.809 --> 03:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
largely gives towns sometimes have
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
acquired these kind of studies already
 
03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
with existing law and existing law could
 
03:20:06.230 --> 03:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
be tweaked if people wanted to clarify
 
03:20:08.809 --> 03:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
it even more so that these studies are
 
03:20:10.309 --> 03:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
needed but again it should only really
 
03:20:12.230 --> 03:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
be focused on areas where you have known
 
03:20:13.849 --> 03:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
problems this is something you wouldn't
 
03:20:15.410 --> 03:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
want to require of every development
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere because we a few and far
 
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
between examples versus kurd but where
 
03:20:21.290 --> 03:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
it has occurred it's a real people feel
 
03:20:23.929 --> 03:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
stranded they're earns 600 000 homes
 
03:20:27.050 --> 03:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
with no viable water supply
 
03:20:31.250 --> 03:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
follow up thanks Mr chairman so are are
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
there other other ways
 
03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
to address it like I've read about
 
03:20:38.650 --> 03:20:38.660 align:start position:0%
inline pumps and things like that other
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
ways to address those issues existing
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
problems or
 
03:20:44.460 --> 03:20:46.190 align:start position:0%
problems or
yeah

03:20:46.190 --> 03:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
right so this question is there a way to
 
03:20:50.450 --> 03:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
address existing homes that have no
 
03:20:52.250 --> 03:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
water right now or no
 
03:20:52.260 --> 03:20:53.330 align:start position:0%
water right now or no
um

03:20:53.330 --> 03:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
you know other than this than this
 
03:20:57.650 --> 03:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
specific legislation
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
you talked about people who are stranded
 
03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
in 600 000 homes with
 
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
lack of water supply
 
03:21:06.230 --> 03:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so were you talking about low water
 
03:21:07.730 --> 03:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
pressure or what were you where we were
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
what were you referring to both I'm
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
aware of developments where people
 
03:21:13.610 --> 03:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
drilled multiple thousand foot Wells
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
that don't produce viable water supply
 
03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
and then I'm aware of a couple instances
 
03:21:21.530 --> 03:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
where neighborhoods have exceedingly
 
03:21:24.230 --> 03:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
High irons of high levels of iron and
 
03:21:27.050 --> 03:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
manganese that essentially needs uh
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
public water system type treatment
 
03:21:30.889 --> 03:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
system and not a system that goes in
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
your basement that you typically have
 
03:21:34.849 --> 03:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
but again that's just a handful they and
 
03:21:36.290 --> 03:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's based on a couple decades of
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
experience in this area
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.050 --> 03:21:44.060 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm in receiptment
 
03:21:53.030 --> 03:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
that was drafted by
 
03:21:55.849 --> 03:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
um representative McWilliams and her
 
03:21:58.849 --> 03:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
change is uh would amend the
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph where it says
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
developers planning to build more than
 
03:22:06.230 --> 03:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
four houses in a subdivision she's
 
03:22:09.650 --> 03:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
including the words or site plan
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
um so does that inclusion
 
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
um how does that impact the Department's
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh position on this bill
 
03:22:20.520 --> 03:22:21.769 align:start position:0%
uh position on this bill
so

03:22:21.769 --> 03:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
the Department's position in this bill
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:22:27.889 --> 03:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
it's intent is well placed and what it's
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish is needed in a few
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
areas but it needs to be accomplished in
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
a whole nother statute that you can't
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
sweep the words here that needs to be in
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
public health or land use planning
 
03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:38.210 align:start position:0%
public health or land use planning
statutes

03:22:38.210 --> 03:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
03:22:40.370 --> 03:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
and both those statutes to a large
 
03:22:42.410 --> 03:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
degree we feel already enabling
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do the things this
 
03:22:45.469 --> 03:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
bill wants to do
 
03:22:47.809 --> 03:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
but we provided the sponsor additional
 
03:22:50.450 --> 03:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
once one we highlighted that those
 
03:22:52.010 --> 03:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
statutes and two we provide additional
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
language where it could fortify people's
 
03:22:55.550 --> 03:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that they have this
 
03:22:57.530 --> 03:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
Authority and then three we went as far
 
03:22:59.809 --> 03:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
as to provide a model regulation that
 
03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
the towns could Implement
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
um for those very localized areas we
 
03:23:06.349 --> 03:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
have known problems and again we have
 
03:23:08.210 --> 03:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
all these materials not because we did
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
it as an agency but the groundwater
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
commission from the legislature 12 years
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
ago asked us to do it so it's not
 
03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily Des product it's not our
 
03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
website it's a remnant of that
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
commission okay thank you
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
03:23:24.479 --> 03:23:26.690 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

03:23:26.690 --> 03:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.370 --> 03:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
mark

03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Mr Cushing floor is
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
yours Bart Cushing
 
03:23:58.610 --> 03:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
um I saw you all last week at this time
 
03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
um I represent New Hampshire water well
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
board that's appointed Board of
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
Contractors State people uh con and
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
citizen member that oversees the
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
industry I'm past president of New
 
03:24:14.210 --> 03:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water well drillers
 
03:24:16.250 --> 03:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
Association New England well drillers
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
Association yeah yeah but biggest thing
 
03:24:21.010 --> 03:24:21.020 align:start position:0%
is I'm here actually because of my kids
 
03:24:23.450 --> 03:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
and our industry
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
um my kids are we got two kids that are
 
03:24:26.570 --> 03:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
with me
 
03:24:29.330 --> 03:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
um we employ 23 people from New
 
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire local contractor we drove
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we're headquartered
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
in Keene but the reason I'm here is
 
03:24:39.889 --> 03:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
because of my kids quite frankly and
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
this this bill has concerns as the one
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
last week about the viability of our
 
03:24:48.110 --> 03:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
industry and about the viability of our
 
03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:49.370 align:start position:0%
industry and about the viability of our
trade

03:24:49.370 --> 03:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
trade
 
03:24:49.380 --> 03:24:50.450 align:start position:0%
trade
um

03:24:50.450 --> 03:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:52.849 --> 03:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
we Supply the wells and pumps and
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance to properties that this
 
03:24:56.450 --> 03:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
would apply to
 
03:24:56.460 --> 03:24:57.769 align:start position:0%
would apply to
um

03:24:57.769 --> 03:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:00.889 --> 03:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
the the few areas of the state that do
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
have water quantity problems don't
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
warrant this regulation
 
03:25:08.809 --> 03:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
now we do work on a lot of hydro
 
03:25:11.690 --> 03:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
geologic studies we drill the wells we
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
do the pump testing we do the monitoring
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
right now currently we just got done
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
doing a well for a town and it was a
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
year in the planning process small town
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
Enfield you're in the planning process
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
they've drilled the well they've still
 
03:25:28.490 --> 03:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
have not done the pump tests they will
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
have to do a hydrogeologic study
 
03:25:34.670 --> 03:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
extensive quantity in quality testing
 
03:25:36.650 --> 03:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
for experience for a long period of time
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
they'll be lucky if they hook that well
 
03:25:40.849 --> 03:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
up in the two-year and they're in a
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
emergency situation we have the same
 
03:25:46.370 --> 03:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
thing going on in Beau in a emergency
 
03:25:49.130 --> 03:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
situation we just did one in South where
 
03:25:52.490 --> 03:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
emergency situation from start to finish
 
03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
before they hook these up it's two years
 
03:25:58.969 --> 03:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
this requirement for just four lot
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
subdivision they want a hydrogeologic
 
03:26:04.849 --> 03:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
study they want water quantity and
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
quality testing it's easy to see two
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
years this testing that we're doing on
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
these other jobs one of the people
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
involved said well we just paid a
 
03:26:15.650 --> 03:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to
 
03:26:17.330 --> 03:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
drill a well we don't even know we can
 
03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
hook up well our part of it was about
 
03:26:21.710 --> 03:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
thirty five thousand but the other parts
 
03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
was fees testing engineering
 
03:26:28.010 --> 03:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
Etc so the cost that this would put on
 
03:26:30.290 --> 03:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
on just four Lots
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
and better is a good hundred grand easy
 
03:26:36.290 --> 03:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
to see if they want to drill the wells
 
03:26:38.330 --> 03:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
in that that they could use later on
 
03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
they have to have the septic systems all
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
done so in the site planning say where's
 
03:26:46.250 --> 03:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
the lot lines where's the septic I
 
03:26:47.929 --> 03:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
didn't notice in here where they said
 
03:26:50.570 --> 03:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
does this mean all lots of one acre or
 
03:26:53.809 --> 03:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
less two acres or less or like I'm on
 
03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
our local planning board we just
 
03:27:00.170 --> 03:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
approved a subdivision of four lots and
 
03:27:02.030 --> 03:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
each of the Lots at around seven and a
 
03:27:04.370 --> 03:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
half to eight Acres so there's no size
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of this realizing that the
 
03:27:10.010 --> 03:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
water in New Hampshire is localized and
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
it also when you use most of the water
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
it goes back into the ground it's not
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
like you pump the water out and it goes
 
03:27:18.530 --> 03:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
away like a large groundwater withdrawal
 
03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
for Poland Springs we're shipping it to
 
03:27:23.450 --> 03:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin or New York City Etc the water
 
03:27:26.330 --> 03:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
comes from the well goes in the Disposal
 
03:27:28.849 --> 03:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
system it percolates into the ground and
 
03:27:31.849 --> 03:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's replenished so applying this to the
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
whole state it's I think it's extremely
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
onerous and costly the data does not
 
03:27:39.769 --> 03:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
support this of the I think there's
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
around two to three thousand Wells
 
03:27:43.969 --> 03:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
drilled a year some years or a lot more
 
03:27:47.330 --> 03:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
some years or less the data does not not
 
03:27:51.530 --> 03:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
support this as Mr Kernan just said
 
03:27:51.540 --> 03:27:53.150 align:start position:0%
support this as Mr Kernan just said
um

03:27:53.150 --> 03:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:54.889 --> 03:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
maybe I think it should be a local
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
requirement as far as the PFA pfos I
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be addressed again
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
at our next hearing it's been addressed
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
this morning it's an emerging chemical
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
just like we had with Arsenic and radon
 
03:28:11.330 --> 03:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
the standards one month or one thing
 
03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
next month they're another thing and
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
then now with the with the PFA pfos they
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
started out with one contaminant one to
 
03:28:21.290 --> 03:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
four now it's six now they're telling us
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's 12 000. we have no
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for testing much like
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
when radon came the radon tests were
 
03:28:30.830 --> 03:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive you could only send
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
them to lab in Colorado it was very
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
onerous the standard went from ten
 
03:28:37.610 --> 03:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
thousand to two thousand to seventy five
 
03:28:39.769 --> 03:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
hundred to four thousand five thousand
 
03:28:41.809 --> 03:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
each of our abutting states are
 
03:28:41.819 --> 03:28:43.250 align:start position:0%
each of our abutting states are
different

03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:28:45.710 --> 03:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that one really needs to
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
go back in the percolator about the
 
03:28:52.130 --> 03:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
about the testing for PFA pfos but the
 
03:28:54.290 --> 03:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
bottom line I guess should say from our
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
vantage point and the future of my
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
children who are in this business and
 
03:29:01.450 --> 03:29:01.460 align:start position:0%
our industry and for the building
 
03:29:04.729 --> 03:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
affordable housing I don't see this as
 
03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
warranted at all four Lots it's a very
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
small threshold no lot size small
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
threshold and in our rural part of New
 
03:29:13.849 --> 03:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where I live I live over in
 
03:29:16.849 --> 03:29:16.859 align:start position:0%
the Monadnock region the only thing that
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
will do is really encourage any
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
development will be on long lines
 
03:29:23.389 --> 03:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
meaning from Municipal wall sources
 
03:29:26.330 --> 03:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
you know from conquered water bow water
 
03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:27.530 align:start position:0%
you know from conquered water bow water
Etc

03:29:27.530 --> 03:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
03:29:30.410 --> 03:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
that that's my comments and I I hope
 
03:29:32.330 --> 03:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
you'd you know I hope I've been helpful
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:37.490 --> 03:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
03:29:37.500 --> 03:29:42.769 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

03:29:42.769 --> 03:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:42.779 --> 03:29:45.769 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:29:45.769 --> 03:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
03:29:51.180 --> 03:29:51.830 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
um

03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
what do you think we could do to ensure
 
03:29:55.920 --> 03:29:57.410 align:start position:0%
what do you think we could do to ensure
that

03:29:57.410 --> 03:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:57.420 --> 03:29:58.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:29:58.190 --> 03:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
people aren't
 
03:30:01.610 --> 03:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
buying a property and there's no
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee you know there's no water I
 
03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
mean how often does that come up and
 
03:30:07.309 --> 03:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
what do you think we could do about that
 
03:30:10.910 --> 03:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
and in our area we have an area and I'll
 
03:30:12.650 --> 03:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
say Chesterfield
 
03:30:15.650 --> 03:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
um where we know that they have low
 
03:30:18.530 --> 03:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
yielding Wells places in Walpole every
 
03:30:21.530 --> 03:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
well contractor knows his local area so
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
much like requirement that's come forth
 
03:30:26.690 --> 03:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
when you go to buy a house that you will
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
have a water quality test a water
 
03:30:32.750 --> 03:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
quantity test would not be out of line
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
in requesting that and many lenders do
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
ask for it and the problem is in water
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
quantity much like testing the devils
 
03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
and the details now on average we know
 
03:30:46.729 --> 03:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
because we we run also water
 
03:30:48.830 --> 03:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
conditioning outfit we go and test
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
people's water we know how many gallons
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
per day they use and generally speaking
 
03:30:56.690 --> 03:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
a residential house we use easily less
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
than 300 gallons per day GPD
 
03:31:03.469 --> 03:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
remembering that one gallon per minute
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
when I go drill a well for you I said
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
great we got water I got one gallon a
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
minute and you look at me not very happy
 
03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
and you think I just put this gallon jug
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
on your table and said that's how much
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
water you got to deal with today
 
03:31:19.630 --> 03:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
well there's 1440 minutes in a day
 
03:31:22.929 --> 03:31:22.939 align:start position:0%
theoretically that well can generate
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
1440 gallons in a day does that meet the
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
300 gallon threshold yes it does easily
 
03:31:31.670 --> 03:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire under the water well
 
03:31:34.190 --> 03:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
board we've come up with fact sheets and
 
03:31:35.630 --> 03:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's nice because we work
 
03:31:37.729 --> 03:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the Des they said
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
well people ask us what's an adequate
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
volume of water so we've come up with
 
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
standards that says a Wells a certain
 
03:31:46.250 --> 03:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
number deep has X number gallons per
 
03:31:48.650 --> 03:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
minute but essentially it says if a well
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
can make 600 gallons per day that that
 
03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
is a adequate water supply
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
now does that cover I want to have a hot
 
03:31:57.239 --> 03:31:58.010 align:start position:0%
now does that cover I want to have a hot
tub

03:31:58.010 --> 03:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
tub
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
I like to drain it every time we use it
 
03:32:02.929 --> 03:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
I like to irrigate my lawn I got a big
 
03:32:05.690 --> 03:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
Garden got a couple cows out back and
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know I like ducks Etc does that
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
cover those things no but for a single
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
family residents we have standards it's
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
five gallons a minute for two hours any
 
03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day we have these standards
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
and they are very applicable to solve
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
this problem when we get asked about
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
that as a well contractor we have to
 
03:32:27.710 --> 03:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
fill out a report that says gallons per
 
03:32:30.050 --> 03:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
minute and flow rate and if they're low
 
03:32:32.330 --> 03:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
flow it's not uncommon for a customer to
 
03:32:35.630 --> 03:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
say geez you did this well in 1998 you
 
03:32:37.309 --> 03:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
show you had a gallon and three quarter
 
03:32:39.290 --> 03:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
a minute I'd like to have a pump test
 
03:32:39.300 --> 03:32:40.910 align:start position:0%
a minute I'd like to have a pump test
done

03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
does that answer that's a long way of
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.170 --> 03:32:51.180 align:start position:0%

03:32:51.180 --> 03:32:52.370 align:start position:0%

03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
I can't say your opposed sharing your
 
03:34:17.870 --> 03:34:17.880 align:start position:0%

people remember to get a letter I mean I
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
have people calling me asking if you
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
ever tested your well and I'll have an
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%

open the hearing and house bill 398.
 
03:50:02.809 --> 03:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
relative to notice of pfas and other
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination prior to the
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
sale of real property
 
03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:11.750 align:start position:0%

chair recognizes representative Wendy
Thomas

03:50:17.210 --> 03:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
03:50:29.150 --> 03:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here to introduce Bill 398
 
03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
which would require testing and
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
notification of pfas and other
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination in water that
 
03:50:39.969 --> 03:50:39.979 align:start position:0%
is connected with real estate property
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
this actually dovetails very nicely with
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
the bill that was heard this morning 205
 
03:50:48.050 --> 03:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
which is for new wells that are that are
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
tested and representative wolf asked the
 
03:50:54.889 --> 03:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
question what happens to existing Wells
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
so this bill would require that for any
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
sale of real estate property that the
 
03:51:05.210 --> 03:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
water be tested if it's if it's um
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
private well the water be tested and the
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
potential buyer being notified prior to
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the sale
 
03:51:13.920 --> 03:51:14.630 align:start position:0%
the sale
um

03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:16.729 --> 03:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
the addition that I would also like to
 
03:51:19.330 --> 03:51:19.340 align:start position:0%
include is that if there's if there's
 
03:51:22.130 --> 03:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
contamination in public water that that
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
also be
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
notified to the buyer that doesn't
 
03:51:28.969 --> 03:51:28.979 align:start position:0%
require testing that simply means going
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the uh the Water website because
 
03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
they're required to test it on a regular
 
03:51:34.739 --> 03:51:36.469 align:start position:0%
they're required to test it on a regular
basis

03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:51:40.130 --> 03:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
now why all the big fuss about pfas I
 
03:51:42.650 --> 03:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
live in Merrimack which is oh and by the
 
03:51:42.660 --> 03:51:43.250 align:start position:0%
live in Merrimack which is oh and by the
way

03:51:43.250 --> 03:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm Wendy Thomas and I represent the
 
03:51:47.929 --> 03:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
town of Merrimack sorry
 
03:51:49.849 --> 03:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
um I live in the town of Merrimack and
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
we have an industrial polluter that has
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
been contaminating our town for decades
 
03:51:59.929 --> 03:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
and I'll just share the personal story
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that I can put forward to show how
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
important this is
 
03:52:06.290 --> 03:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
when we first heard about the
 
03:52:08.929 --> 03:52:08.939 align:start position:0%
contamination in in our town the state
 
03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
told us that only the houses that were
 
03:52:13.490 --> 03:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
within a half mile radius of this
 
03:52:15.050 --> 03:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
Corporation needed to worry about
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
contamination to their Wells
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
it didn't take long for the state to
 
03:52:20.330 --> 03:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
realize that it was a bigger problem
 
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
than that and they expanded the area of
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
concern to a mile radius around this
 
03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:27.889 align:start position:0%
concern to a mile radius around this
Corporation

03:52:27.889 --> 03:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
my house is three miles from this
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation but I have six children
 
03:52:34.610 --> 03:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
they're adults now
 
03:52:37.370 --> 03:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
um so I went and had our private well
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
tested the results came back so high
 
03:52:41.809 --> 03:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
that we had to immediately shut our weld
 
03:52:41.819 --> 03:52:42.410 align:start position:0%
that we had to immediately shut our weld
down

03:52:42.410 --> 03:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:52:44.330 --> 03:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
when we installed a whole house
 
03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
filtration system with a reverse osmosis
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
in the kitchen
 
03:52:50.809 --> 03:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
um that's all that we that I would let
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
my kids drink from the reverse osmosis
 
03:52:57.050 --> 03:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
for years about three years ago this
 
03:52:57.060 --> 03:52:58.309 align:start position:0%
for years about three years ago this
Corporation

03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
03:53:01.190 --> 03:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
um realized that
 
03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:03.779 align:start position:0%
they potentially impacted our wells
 
03:53:04.969 --> 03:53:04.979 align:start position:0%
they've never really taken
 
03:53:07.550 --> 03:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility but um for the last three
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
years we've been supplied with bottled
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
water that's what we drink in our house
 
03:53:13.729 --> 03:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
we cannot drink our well water it's too
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
poisonous to drink
 
03:53:16.080 --> 03:53:16.670 align:start position:0%
poisonous to drink
um

03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
the results even even with filtration
 
03:53:21.490 --> 03:53:21.500 align:start position:0%
and everything the results of having
 
03:53:24.769 --> 03:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
exposure to pfas and my family for so
 
03:53:24.779 --> 03:53:26.090 align:start position:0%
exposure to pfas and my family for so
long

03:53:26.090 --> 03:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
long
 
03:53:28.010 --> 03:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I've recently put down
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
um my fourth dog due to cancer and I I
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
don't have the big dogs I've got the
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
little dogs the little bedroom slipper
 
03:53:37.550 --> 03:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
dogs these guys are the canaries in the
 
03:53:39.710 --> 03:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
coal mine if you talk to people in my
 
03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:40.910 align:start position:0%
coal mine if you talk to people in my
town

03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
um our cats and dogs are dying left and
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
right these they have little body weight
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.889 --> 03:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
um personally
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I thought it was safe we put in a
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
whole house filtration system with
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis been drinking water in
 
03:54:04.370 --> 03:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
May of 2022 I was diagnosed with cancer
 
03:54:06.170 --> 03:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
um at the advice of the environmental
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
working group I had my blood tested for
 
03:54:12.170 --> 03:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
pfas for 40 pfas chemicals I have 12
 
03:54:14.570 --> 03:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
chemicals in my body that are over the
 
03:54:17.450 --> 03:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
toxic limit that's allowed for humans my
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
total pfoa
 
03:54:21.290 --> 03:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are associated with
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
breast cancer I have more than 38 times
 
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
the toxic level that's allowed for
 
03:54:28.849 --> 03:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
humans my total pfos which are related
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
to ovarian and fallopian cancer as well
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
as some others I have more than 99
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
percent of Americans do in in my body
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
when I went public with my story in my
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
town dozens of people reached out to me
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
with their cancer stories we have a ton
 
03:54:49.250 --> 03:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
of cancer in our town not only do we
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
have cancer but we have autoimmune
 
03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:51.650 align:start position:0%
have cancer but we have autoimmune
disease

03:54:51.650 --> 03:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
disease
 
03:54:55.969 --> 03:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
we have a autistic symptoms we have
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
thyroid issues we have high cholesterol
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
we have high blood sugar and those
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
aren't just inconveniences those are
 
03:55:05.389 --> 03:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
killer diseases
 
03:55:08.570 --> 03:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we have found out that women who
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
drink pfasts water during their
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
pregnancies at the levels that we see in
 
03:55:15.769 --> 03:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
the town of Merrimack have a higher rate
 
03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
of giving birth to babies with autistic
 
03:55:21.290 --> 03:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
symptoms and learning disabilities
 
03:55:24.650 --> 03:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
so this is not just something that's
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
nice to do this is this is protecting
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
and giving them a chance to
 
03:55:35.330 --> 03:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
um protect themselves and their children
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
and their families
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that
 
03:55:41.210 --> 03:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
um we are stuck in our house we cannot
 
03:55:44.210 --> 03:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
sell our house right now I mentioned
 
03:55:46.250 --> 03:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
earlier I have six children six adult
 
03:55:48.530 --> 03:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
children only one is living at home we
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
have a very large house that we can't
 
03:55:53.090 --> 03:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
sell who is going to buy a house with a
 
03:55:54.910 --> 03:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
well that you cannot use the water
 
03:55:58.429 --> 03:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
eventually we're supposed to at the cost
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the cost of the corporation excuse
 
03:56:05.210 --> 03:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
me we are supposed to be hooked up to
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
public water the dates on that um vary
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
from two years from now to seven years
 
03:56:11.689 --> 03:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
from now
 
03:56:14.570 --> 03:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
so we have no idea
 
03:56:14.580 --> 03:56:15.170 align:start position:0%
so we have no idea
um

03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
if I knew our house had contaminated
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
water I would have never never purchased
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
it and I think that that's the fear of
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
some of the real estate agents but is
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
the price of selling a house and getting
 
03:56:32.809 --> 03:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
a profit worth potentially
 
03:56:35.570 --> 03:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh giving people lifelong illnesses and
 
03:56:35.580 --> 03:56:37.370 align:start position:0%
uh giving people lifelong illnesses and
cancer

03:56:37.370 --> 03:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
now once I've said that
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I believe that this bill could be
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
rolled into the one you heard earlier
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
this morning which was 205 and I
 
03:56:47.389 --> 03:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
understand that you're going to be
 
03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
working on an amendment for that one I'm
 
03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
not sure they need to be two separate
 
03:56:53.450 --> 03:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
bills I think they can be rolled into
 
03:56:57.769 --> 03:56:57.779 align:start position:0%
one real estate Bill where uh
 
03:56:59.809 --> 03:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
notification of water needs to be done
 
03:57:03.170 --> 03:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
before any transaction any real estate
 
03:57:05.809 --> 03:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
transaction takes place
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
03:57:12.600 --> 03:57:20.229 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.610 --> 03:57:22.620 align:start position:0%

I see notification which which basically
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
encourages buyers to test the water and
 
03:57:44.809 --> 03:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
I see
 
03:57:47.330 --> 03:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
um disclosure which says
 
03:57:47.340 --> 03:57:50.570 align:start position:0%
um disclosure which says

I withdraw my question sorry I'm reading

03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
let's see what what I'll come back to
 
03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
you and uh in that scriptable
 
03:58:10.380 --> 03:58:12.229 align:start position:0%
you and uh in that scriptable
representative

03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:14.450 --> 03:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for a question and
 
03:58:17.210 --> 03:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
I'll return to representative garby
 
03:58:19.250 --> 03:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:58:21.290 --> 03:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
this is a Statewide notification bill
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
that will be administered
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
or what is the penalty if somebody
 
03:58:34.450 --> 03:58:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:36.769 --> 03:58:36.779 align:start position:0%
just like this morning
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about penalties
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure
 
03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
I mean the penalty would be that I guess
 
03:58:47.150 --> 03:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't buy the property I mean
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
there there is no no penalty I
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see one but I'm not quite
 
03:58:55.309 --> 03:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
sure how you would go with that go ahead
 
03:58:56.450 --> 03:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
and do that
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and the reason also this is Statewide
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
is because pfas is it flows it flows in
 
03:59:04.130 --> 03:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
water it flows in air it's coming to a
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
town near you
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
if it's not already there
 
03:59:11.689 --> 03:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up follow-up thank you
 
03:59:11.699 --> 03:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up follow-up thank you
well

03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
03:59:19.790 --> 03:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
an appropriate remedy that the registry
 
03:59:21.769 --> 03:59:21.779 align:start position:0%
of deeds
 
03:59:26.110 --> 03:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
would not record a deed if that
 
03:59:28.969 --> 03:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment is not included in the
 
03:59:28.979 --> 03:59:29.870 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment is not included in the
deed

03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
deed
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
I hadn't thought of that but that would
 
03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
be a simple way to do it I agree with
 
03:59:38.040 --> 03:59:41.809 align:start position:0%
be a simple way to do it I agree with
you

03:59:41.809 --> 03:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:46.030 --> 03:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative Darby for a question
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I still need some
 
03:59:53.410 --> 03:59:53.420 align:start position:0%
explanation on
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
398. because what I read in the existing
 
04:00:01.490 --> 04:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
477 4A is that shall provide the
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
following notification and then the
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
language is added here you know starting
 
04:00:09.229 --> 04:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
on line 26 on page one is a notification
 
04:00:12.170 --> 04:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
about pfas including the buyers
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
encouraged to
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
um to test
 
04:00:17.450 --> 04:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
and then the second section I see that
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
they need to disclose if they've
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
received notification from Des about
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
pfas but I don't see
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
when you your testimony started by
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying that it requires the water to be
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
tested prior to sale but I don't see
 
04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
the the flow of this bill would need a
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of work
 
04:00:44.210 --> 04:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
um I think we all know that OLS was a
 
04:00:45.769 --> 04:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
little overwhelmed when they were doing
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
some of the bills and this was supposed
 
04:00:49.790 --> 04:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
to match some of the other bills that
 
04:00:51.769 --> 04:00:51.779 align:start position:0%
were out there but it doesn't I actually
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
think the wording of notification in 205
 
04:00:57.050 --> 04:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
is stronger than than this bill so
 
04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons I think I
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
think it could I think both of these
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
bills could be merged
 
04:01:05.090 --> 04:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
if not though if you want to have it as
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
a separate bill I'd be happy to to um to
 
04:01:10.010 --> 04:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
work on an amendment of it and push this
 
04:01:15.969 --> 04:01:15.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.410 --> 04:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative harbden
 
04:01:21.110 --> 04:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
and Denver representative Vale thank you
 
04:01:22.610 --> 04:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
I asked the question earlier to
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative Muse do you have a
 
04:01:28.130 --> 04:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
problem if the effective date of the
 
04:01:31.610 --> 04:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill is amended to uh January 1 2024.
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.170 --> 04:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative Vale question
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas for taking my
 
04:01:44.689 --> 04:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
question I'm just wondering if you can
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
walk us through on page two from line
 
04:01:50.689 --> 04:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
five to the um to nine where it says
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
disclosure required prior to the
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at this I'm I'm trying
 
04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
to buy a house
 
04:02:03.530 --> 04:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:06.650 --> 04:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
so you're you're the buyer I'm the buyer
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
so um the seller would have to provide
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
the the testing and the notification the
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
seller would have to provide testing
 
04:02:20.090 --> 04:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that Des
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
well actually
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
so so this bill says that Des would also
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
um have a have a statement but um that
 
04:02:34.130 --> 04:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
would come after after the fact I mean
 
04:02:36.290 --> 04:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
you can't hold up a house sale for Des
 
04:02:38.269 --> 04:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
to do the notification
 
04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
so this is primarily the testing
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.689 --> 04:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
04:02:47.699 --> 04:02:50.389 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.090 --> 04:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
oh do you have a question thank you Mr
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Thomas
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see this is a notification bill
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
from what I'm reading it I don't see
 
04:03:04.130 --> 04:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
where there's a requirement for testing
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how one could notify
 
04:03:19.610 --> 04:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:19.620 --> 04:03:23.689 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:03:23.689 --> 04:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
but you're right it doesn't exactly
 
04:03:29.689 --> 04:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative wolves for a question
 
04:03:40.490 --> 04:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you as I read this bill
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
up until you get to section two it's all
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
about making the buyer aware of
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
radon arsenic lead and pfas was added to
 
04:03:55.130 --> 04:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
an existing bill
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
so it's an acknowledgment that
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
that the buyer has been informed
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
that they have to that they are aware
 
04:04:07.729 --> 04:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
that testing is available
 
04:04:07.739 --> 04:04:09.170 align:start position:0%
that testing is available
period

04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
the next one is if they require if they
 
04:04:15.170 --> 04:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
have gotten a notice of a problem
 
04:04:18.170 --> 04:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
then it has to be disclosed to the buyer
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.450 --> 04:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
am I missing something
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of this bill is that
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
going forward in New Hampshire any real
 
04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
estate transaction must require water
 
04:04:34.680 --> 04:04:38.090 align:start position:0%
estate transaction must require water
testing

04:04:38.090 --> 04:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so Des has a has a water testing
 
04:04:44.640 --> 04:04:46.130 align:start position:0%
and so Des has a has a water testing
profile

04:04:46.130 --> 04:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
profile
 
04:04:46.140 --> 04:04:53.689 align:start position:0%
profile
standard

04:04:53.689 --> 04:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.490 --> 04:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
I don't see in this bill anything
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
that says that you have to have your
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.650 --> 04:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
um am I missing something
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
no I don't think you are which is why I
 
04:05:15.650 --> 04:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
think this should be rolled in with 205
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
um because I think the wording on that
 
04:05:19.490 --> 04:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
one is is stronger or again if we want
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
to make it um if this standalone so the
 
04:05:26.210 --> 04:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to
 
04:05:27.889 --> 04:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
as I said before any real estate
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
transaction in New Hampshire to have the
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
water tested and have the buyer be made
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require the seller to
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
remediate anything to put in a whole
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
house filtration system that's up to the
 
04:05:50.689 --> 04:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
buyer to decide whether or not
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
they want to do that or if they want to
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
continue with purchasing the property
 
04:05:57.410 --> 04:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
but we
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
as it was alluded to in 205 this morning
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
we all thought that our water in New
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was clean and safe
 
04:06:07.729 --> 04:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
in the case of pfas you can't smell it
 
04:06:11.450 --> 04:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
you can't taste it you can't see it
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
um it's it's come quite it's become an
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
issue and and certainly in Southern New
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's quite a shock to many
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
of us especially those of us with
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
private Wells that thought we were doing
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
the best things for our kids you know
 
04:06:25.729 --> 04:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
04:06:28.130 --> 04:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
water you know ice ice water from the
 
04:06:30.830 --> 04:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
glaciers in our wells that kind of thing
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
um it just it's it's a shock to many of
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
us that we have been drinking poisoned
 
04:06:38.929 --> 04:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
water for so long and we had no idea no
 
04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:46.729 --> 04:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
is that really cute
 
04:06:50.330 --> 04:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
I have trouble seeing it all I see is a
 
04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman light behind you
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas for
 
04:06:55.610 --> 04:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:06:59.570 --> 04:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.580 --> 04:07:01.429 align:start position:0%
 
specifically

04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
the part that refers to an area within
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
500 feet of the subject real estate
 
04:07:09.050 --> 04:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
could that require the seller
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
to research or have knowledge of
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
adjacent properties and how many
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
different adjacent properties would the
 
04:07:18.050 --> 04:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
seller have to have knowledge and
 
04:07:18.060 --> 04:07:19.490 align:start position:0%
seller have to have knowledge and
disclose

04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
disclose
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the notification of groundwater
 
04:07:21.000 --> 04:07:22.490 align:start position:0%
the notification of groundwater
contaminations

04:07:22.490 --> 04:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
contaminations
 
04:07:24.530 --> 04:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
so like numerous different properties
 
04:07:26.809 --> 04:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
and how long would that hold up the
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
sale it that's the the Department of
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is who keeps
 
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
track of the that their tested water
 
04:07:34.140 --> 04:07:36.530 align:start position:0%
track of the that their tested water
sites

04:07:36.530 --> 04:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
sites
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
um so to have
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
um so I guess they would have to check
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
that website to see where the
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
contaminated Wells are I do know that in
 
04:07:47.929 --> 04:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
my particular neighborhood which is an
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
older neighborhood with lots of Wells
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
um several households have gotten
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
letters whenever they test a well and
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's property within 500 feet of that
 
04:08:00.290 --> 04:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
they're automatically notified so I'm
 
04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's something the real
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
estate agent would have to do as opposed
 
04:08:07.010 --> 04:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Environmental
 
04:08:09.050 --> 04:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
Services because that's one of the
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
things they take care of
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
anyone else
yeah

04:08:21.189 --> 04:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:08:23.880 --> 04:08:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:27.050 --> 04:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
so Wendy it sounds like I'm sorry
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas sounds it's okay
 
04:08:35.630 --> 04:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like you would be open to
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
working with a subcommittee or working
 
04:08:39.769 --> 04:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
with one of us on an amendment that
 
04:08:39.779 --> 04:08:40.910 align:start position:0%
with one of us on an amendment that
would

04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm building off of Representative
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
Wolf's questions that would help the
 
04:08:45.000 --> 04:08:46.250 align:start position:0%
Wolf's questions that would help the
bill

04:08:46.250 --> 04:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:08:46.260 --> 04:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:49.610 --> 04:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
look like you want or do what you were
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
hoping it would do yes I would be very
 
04:08:54.050 --> 04:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
open to it and I and I actually like
 
04:08:56.929 --> 04:08:56.939 align:start position:0%
that suggestion of registry of deeds
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
um having some kind of authorization
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
over this
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
um again this was this is a bill that
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
was recommended by the 737 pfas
 
04:09:08.520 --> 04:09:10.189 align:start position:0%
was recommended by the 737 pfas
Commission

04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:09:10.199 --> 04:09:10.910 align:start position:0%
Commission
um

04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
wording issues I I think
 
04:09:16.020 --> 04:09:16.729 align:start position:0%
wording issues I I think
um

04:09:16.729 --> 04:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
04:09:20.090 --> 04:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
I think it needs an amendment that's
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to say
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
but yes I would be very open to it and
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
and again I I think it dovetails with
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
205. I I think there there could be a
 
04:09:31.250 --> 04:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
way that we could merge the two together
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
into one real estate bill but if you
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
want this to stand alone I would be more
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
than happy to work on them with with you
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
on an amendment on it
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.090 --> 04:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
um yes um representative Thomas
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
um you had said from the 737 pfas
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
commission is that the house bill 737
 
04:10:02.090 --> 04:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
statutory commission that we're talking
 
04:10:04.370 --> 04:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
about yes it is thank you so much thank
 
04:10:04.380 --> 04:10:08.210 align:start position:0%
about yes it is thank you so much thank
you

04:10:08.210 --> 04:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else for the question
 
04:10:13.969 --> 04:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:10:16.210 --> 04:10:16.220 align:start position:0%
will not look any further
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
Brandon Kernan
 
04:10:38.689 --> 04:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.729 --> 04:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you and Brandon Kernan
 
04:10:42.050 --> 04:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
administrator of drinking water and
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau here to testify on
 
04:10:47.330 --> 04:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 398 and our understanding of
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
the bill it does two things one requires
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
that information be provided to
 
04:10:53.530 --> 04:10:53.540 align:start position:0%
homeowners about the importance of
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
addressing pfas and testing it in about
 
04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
its possible occurrence
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then two the other part of the bill
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
which we haven't really talked about
 
04:11:03.769 --> 04:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
this today is if you are a current
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
homeowner and you're selling your
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
property and in the past you have
 
04:11:08.809 --> 04:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
received a letter from the Department
 
04:11:10.969 --> 04:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
saying that there's contamination and a
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
well within 500 feet of your property
 
04:11:14.929 --> 04:11:14.939 align:start position:0%
that you disclose that you got that
 
04:11:18.290 --> 04:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
letter when on a on a form to the
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
potential buyer of your home
 
04:11:23.210 --> 04:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
as far as my testimony I mean obviously
 
04:11:24.530 --> 04:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
the department thinks the education is
 
04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
really important for pfest and perhaps I
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
can just reference the conversation
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
earlier today for House Bill 205 rather
 
04:11:31.490 --> 04:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
than so we're rehashing that you know we
 
04:11:33.050 --> 04:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
obviously think informing people is
 
04:11:34.490 --> 04:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
really important
 
04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
so I'll spend more time addressing that
 
04:11:40.010 --> 04:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
just a disclosure requirement
 
04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
you know we support the intent and we
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
think people should know when they're
 
04:11:45.830 --> 04:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
buying a property if there are potential
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
concerns that they want to proactively
 
04:11:50.330 --> 04:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
address as part of that transaction
 
04:11:53.210 --> 04:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about this disclosure
 
04:11:55.490 --> 04:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
requirement we think it could provide a
 
04:11:58.729 --> 04:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
soft false sense of security and perhaps
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's a better ways to go about making
 
04:12:01.910 --> 04:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
sure potential buyers are aware of
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
contamination concerns
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'll just outline why let me back up a
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
little bit there is a statute passed
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s that says when
 
04:12:13.070 --> 04:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's a man-made contaminant over a
 
04:12:15.050 --> 04:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
state standard an MCL or an ambient
 
04:12:17.809 --> 04:12:17.819 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standard that Dess
 
04:12:20.450 --> 04:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
to notify all Property Owners within 500
 
04:12:23.809 --> 04:12:23.819 align:start position:0%
feet that that that that result was
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
found in groundwater
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so that happens generally
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
systematically whenever we have an
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
exceedance of just a man-made
 
04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
contaminant not naturally occurring
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
contaminants like arsenic or uranium
 
04:12:37.370 --> 04:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges though is that
 
04:12:39.889 --> 04:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
while we send these letters out we send
 
04:12:42.530 --> 04:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
them out one time and so
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
properties change hands frequently in
 
04:12:46.849 --> 04:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
some cases and it may be that even use
 
04:12:49.010 --> 04:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
pfast example we started sampling in
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
2016 because we sent letters in 2016 to
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
people that might have had a result
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
nearby above a standard that property
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
changed hands the current property owner
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
who may now be selling the home wouldn't
 
04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
have knowledge of that letter and so you
 
04:13:05.210 --> 04:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
would not be disclosing it and someone
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
would have no reason to believe it might
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
be a concern separate of the education
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
component that that we talked about
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
the other issue is that standards change
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
over time when we started sampling in
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
2016 we were notifying people if they
 
04:13:22.490 --> 04:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
exceeded PFO mpfast over 70 parts per
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
trillion and our standard is now 12
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion and so people would
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
not have received that 500 foot letter
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
in that transition period from our old
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
standard to the new standard so again
 
04:13:34.370 --> 04:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be disclosing anything and
 
04:13:36.889 --> 04:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
it might be a false sense of security
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know one other thing that happened
 
04:13:40.130 --> 04:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
in Southern New Hampshire which is
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
really unique you know the many square
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
mile contamination area is we did
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
something better than the 500 foot
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
notification we just offered to sample a
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of people's Wells
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
um and saying that there's generally
 
04:13:54.889 --> 04:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
contamination in the area and we weren't
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
playing around with 500 feet we were
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
picking large circles you know half
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
square miles out of our half mile
 
04:14:02.210 --> 04:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
radiuses at a time and kept expanding
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
out and so while people got letters it's
 
04:14:08.090 --> 04:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
not a 500 foot letter so to speak and so
 
04:14:10.729 --> 04:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
that might cause confusion
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
another thing that's important is that
 
04:14:14.450 --> 04:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before we only do
 
04:14:16.610 --> 04:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
notifications for man-made contaminants
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
it doesn't and so
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't address the possibility of
 
04:14:23.210 --> 04:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
arsenic being in the groundwater above
 
04:14:25.250 --> 04:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
standard which about 30 of homes how's
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
that challenge or uranium or manganese
 
04:14:30.410 --> 04:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
our radon being elevated and so again
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
someone might feel falsely secure by the
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
fact that there's no letter being
 
04:14:36.170 --> 04:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
disclosed to them
 
04:14:38.689 --> 04:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
and then another one this is funny to me
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm in the business I'm kind of a
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
water nerd but people don't remember
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
they get notified there's been I get a
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
lot of calls routed to me for private
 
04:14:48.170 --> 04:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
Wells I'm not the one administering it
 
04:14:49.370 --> 04:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
but I get a lot of calls around it to me
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
and I know how to answer them and where
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
to find information so I do
 
04:14:55.370 --> 04:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
but it's funny people ask why their well
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
was never sampled and we have a very
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
organized data structure that I can go
 
04:15:00.889 --> 04:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
to any Town any road any address and
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
quickly see what we have for them
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
letters or data and we'll have an email
 
04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
to that person in an email response for
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
the result and so people are asking why
 
04:15:11.150 --> 04:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
they weren't sampled and they were it's
 
04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
just life's chaotic lately and people
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
don't recall so people would not be
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
disclosing and you know forgetting that
 
04:15:20.450 --> 04:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
they forgot you know that they did have
 
04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
it done essentially so that's another
 
04:15:24.889 --> 04:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
issue and then the mechanism for
 
04:15:27.530 --> 04:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
enforcing this requirement is a question
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know first of all how would you do
 
04:15:32.330 --> 04:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
it and so how could you really prove
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
someone knowingly didn't disclose a
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
letter because again we have clear
 
04:15:37.969 --> 04:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
examples of people not remembering
 
04:15:39.530 --> 04:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
we think what we talked about earlier
 
04:15:41.689 --> 04:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
the education and Outreach is important
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
recommending testing when people are
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
buying homes is important and also
 
04:15:46.849 --> 04:15:46.859 align:start position:0%
letting people know they should contact
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
DES if they want to find out about water
 
04:15:51.889 --> 04:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
quality we might have for the address
 
04:15:54.170 --> 04:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
they're buying or nearby addresses and
 
04:15:56.689 --> 04:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
look at our data mapper we have a pfas
 
04:15:59.570 --> 04:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
mapper if we're focusing on pfas where
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
you can look at any neighborhood and see
 
04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
the general results you can't see
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
people's addresses we Grays out if you
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
go in too far because we're trying to
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
protect you know private private
 
04:16:10.610 --> 04:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
information but ultimately it is all
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
private information if you called us and
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
said there's a lot of red dots in the
 
04:16:16.130 --> 04:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
area you want to buy a home what what
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
are the results for this that and the
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
other address it's public information
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
public funds were used to buy it and
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's public information and we would get
 
04:16:24.410 --> 04:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
that to you
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
going back to the registry of deeds
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
concept that's a good concept and
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
historically that's how we notified
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
people that their property was
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
contaminated and it would transfer to a
 
04:16:36.650 --> 04:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
possible buyer
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
historically our waste sites were like a
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
gas station or a couple acre industrial
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
site and maybe a few homes nearby were
 
04:16:46.130 --> 04:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
impacted and so once you delineated the
 
04:16:47.809 --> 04:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
contamination we had what we call a
 
04:16:49.729 --> 04:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
groundwater management Zone in our rules
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
in that zone all the land in that zone
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
had to have the associated
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
um the land area with the registry of
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
deeds you know the Lots recorded that
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's an active groundwater management
 
04:17:06.290 --> 04:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
zone until it's cleaned up at which
 
04:17:07.969 --> 04:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
point the reference to the ground
 
04:17:09.889 --> 04:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
management Zone would be removed from
 
04:17:12.110 --> 04:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
that lot with the registry of deeds and
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
that was really effective and it was
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
manageable because again it would these
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
relatively small sites and just a few
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Lots we would have tens of thousands of
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
lots right now that we'd have to
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
register with the registry of deeds
 
04:17:26.689 --> 04:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
based on the air emissions in Southern
 
04:17:30.170 --> 04:17:30.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so while this hasn't
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
been put in place yet I know there's
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
discussions about coming up with some
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
sort of overlay identifying the area
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire that potentially
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
could have been impacted by these
 
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
Regional emissions and all alternative
 
04:17:44.809 --> 04:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
approach is being pursued because you
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
just can't go and put tens of thousands
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
of of recordings of the groundwater
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
management Zone on in the registry of
 
04:17:53.150 --> 04:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
deeds for what we have going on in
 
04:17:56.150 --> 04:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire at this point
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
any questions but representative wrong
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
04:18:07.849 --> 04:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
Kerner for taking my question
 
04:18:10.729 --> 04:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
um in the letter that you distributed
 
04:18:13.490 --> 04:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Scott on the second
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
page you note that homeowners that have
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
received a notification in the past may
 
04:18:21.290 --> 04:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
not relate the notification they
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
received to the proposed new disclosure
 
04:18:23.640 --> 04:18:25.429 align:start position:0%
received to the proposed new disclosure
requirement

04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:18:28.130 --> 04:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
so this brings up two questions of mine
 
04:18:32.330 --> 04:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
one is that disclosure or that that
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
um disclosure notification is that
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
addressed specifically to that homeowner
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
does it or does it just you know to whom
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
it may concern no it's specifically
 
04:18:44.570 --> 04:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
addressed to that homeowner we um
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
essentially have a Statewide tax map in
 
04:18:49.969 --> 04:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
GIS that has mailing addresses for all
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
the current property owners and so we
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
can plop a circle right on it and pull
 
04:18:55.490 --> 04:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
the names and mailing addresses and the
 
04:18:56.929 --> 04:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
letters go right out so I'm letting them
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
know within 500 feet you have this
 
04:19:01.010 --> 04:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
result so it's customized letter form
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
language for the most part but it's
 
04:19:05.830 --> 04:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
targeting by name and address
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
who's within 500 feet okay follow-up so
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing you say and from this
 
04:19:15.849 --> 04:19:15.859 align:start position:0%
letter is that homeowners may get that
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
personalized first class letter but just
 
04:19:22.130 --> 04:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
kind of disregard it they don't really
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
consider it seriously so that if they're
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
selling their home and they see that
 
04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
they have to disclose if they've
 
04:19:31.130 --> 04:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
received a letter it might Escape their
 
04:19:31.140 --> 04:19:32.090 align:start position:0%
received a letter it might Escape their
mind

04:19:32.090 --> 04:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
but I'm having a hard time reconciling
 
04:19:37.610 --> 04:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
reconciling that with the expectation
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
that a prospective buyer would know
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
enough to go to Des on their own and
 
04:19:45.769 --> 04:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
look up the map and everything to me the
 
04:19:49.370 --> 04:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
homeowner would retain the in would
 
04:19:51.769 --> 04:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
retain that notification of like oh wow
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
I got this letter
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
much more than a prospective buyer would
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
say oh I need to go to
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
des.nh.gov and look up their their
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
mapping so I I'm just having a hard time
 
04:20:08.150 --> 04:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you can help me reconcile that those
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
two approaches a buyer and then a seller
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
would have on addressing the need for
 
04:20:18.650 --> 04:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
becoming informed about potential pfas
 
04:20:21.410 --> 04:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
that might be in their well
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
so I definitely think a buyer
 
04:20:26.570 --> 04:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
could be prompted to do that work and
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
would do the work if they were given
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
information on how to do that work up
 
04:20:31.610 --> 04:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
front to look to see what information is
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
in that area it wouldn't cross their
 
04:20:35.150 --> 04:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
mind if that someone didn't suggest it
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
to them so perhaps
 
04:20:39.950 --> 04:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
through the work of 205 or this bill you
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
know something proactive saying we
 
04:20:43.250 --> 04:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at records of the
 
04:20:44.809 --> 04:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Service to
 
04:20:46.610 --> 04:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
see what's available for information in
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
the area and so that would prompt them
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
as far as the seller it's kind of lost
 
04:20:52.429 --> 04:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
on me how people forget these things but
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
again I think about water all the time
 
04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
but I get these calls all the time where
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
people ask why their Wells weren't
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
tested and we did test it and we have
 
04:21:03.530 --> 04:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
responses for them Thanking us they call
 
04:21:07.010 --> 04:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
they email us asking somebody I don't
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
know if it was a company or you guys
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
tested or well four years ago and I've
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
never got the result and I'm trying to
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
figure it out and we have the result we
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
have our correspondence to them
 
04:21:18.410 --> 04:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's gonna happen all the
 
04:21:19.729 --> 04:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
time but I'm saying it's a real issue
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah if yours goes on it's funny that
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
some people lose track of what happened
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the past relative to this issue okay
 
04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for a question I can
 
04:21:34.610 --> 04:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:21:39.170 --> 04:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
question does Des keep a database of all
 
04:21:41.090 --> 04:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
of these letters that they have sent out
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
I assume but I'm not confused assume do
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
they send them out certified and do they
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
keep a database
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
no we did not send them out certified as
 
04:21:53.570 --> 04:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
far as the database we have something
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
akin to the database it's very organized
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
file directory we have a directory for
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
every town and like on it on your on a
 
04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
network drive and then for every town we
 
04:22:07.010 --> 04:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
have a road every road is down and then
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
you have every subdirectory with the
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
street number and So within two minutes
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you say 10 Brown Hill Road and bow I
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
can tell you if we have something or Not
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
by just going to that directory like
 
04:22:18.000 --> 04:22:20.530 align:start position:0%
by just going to that directory like
that

04:22:20.530 --> 04:22:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so it would be relatively easy
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
for either a buyer or a seller
 
04:22:28.080 --> 04:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
for either a buyer or a seller
to

04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
contact DES and find out whether
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
um the notice has been sent out as in
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
section two
 
04:22:38.040 --> 04:22:40.429 align:start position:0%
section two
yes

04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:22:44.330 --> 04:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
so okay what would be difficult is
 
04:22:47.210 --> 04:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
if it became a full-time job for someone
 
04:22:49.490 --> 04:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
to answer those inquiry inquiries that
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
that could be done but our resources
 
04:22:52.910 --> 04:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
would be needed because we don't have a
 
04:22:55.610 --> 04:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
person available to answer real estate
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
calls all day long right now
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.150 --> 04:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
now uh
 
04:23:19.070 --> 04:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking my
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Chris Norwood I am
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
a commercial real estate broker uh owner
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
of a real estate firm in New Hampshire
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
with offices in Bedford and Portsmouth
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm also the 2022 chair 23 chair of the
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of Realtors
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
as written were opposed to the bill
 
04:23:55.969 --> 04:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
however we certainly it sounds like
 
04:23:58.610 --> 04:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
there is momentum to create some sort of
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
working group or study group on this and
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're happy to participate in that I
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
hope to clear up a couple questions that
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
have been raised earlier so first we see
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
two points in this bill on the first
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
page lines 26 through uh line two of the
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
following page is adding an additional
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
notification so representative I believe
 
04:24:24.110 --> 04:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
the question came up earlier the
 
04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
distinction between notification and
 
04:24:28.729 --> 04:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
disclosure and I'll try and be precise
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
with my language today when I go to
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
inform a seller or a buyer about the
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
difference in our state statute between
 
04:24:39.170 --> 04:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
notification and disclosure notification
 
04:24:42.530 --> 04:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
I take to mean these things radon
 
04:24:45.650 --> 04:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
arsenic lead and could potentially be
 
04:24:48.170 --> 04:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
pfas are things that exist in the state
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the subject property
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
may or may not have those contaminants
 
04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
but they exist somewhere in the state of
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so relative to the
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
notification piece in this bill the Bold
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
piece a language similar to this we
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
think could be appropriate I think we
 
04:25:07.849 --> 04:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
have some concerns when we introduce on
 
04:25:11.710 --> 04:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
line 26 words like common
 
04:25:14.330 --> 04:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
because there are parts of the state
 
04:25:16.330 --> 04:25:16.340 align:start position:0%
where it is not common
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
again okay inserting General language of
 
04:25:23.090 --> 04:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
notification I think the word smithing
 
04:25:26.450 --> 04:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
of exactly what goes into that should
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
should be looked into
 
04:25:30.650 --> 04:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
the second section of this bill where we
 
04:25:32.929 --> 04:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
view it on the second page line three
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
through line 10.
 
04:25:37.250 --> 04:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
is a disclosure
 
04:25:39.769 --> 04:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
when I talk to buyers and sellers I use
 
04:25:43.130 --> 04:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
the word disclosure to say a known
 
04:25:47.090 --> 04:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
defect as do you Mr Mrs seller know
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
about this defect in your property and
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
to give you a flavor of some of the
 
04:25:53.570 --> 04:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
disclosures that are required you have
 
04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
is your property an asbestos dump RSA
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
141 is your property a condo RSA 356
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
what type of water do you have RSA 477
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
what type of sewer do you have RSA 477
 
04:26:12.170 --> 04:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
and those disclosures contain an
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
obligation for the the seller to
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
participate in that disclosure they have
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
to say do I know this yes no unknown
 
04:26:23.450 --> 04:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
when was the last time I had my sewer
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
tested yes no unknown date of the sewer
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
test so the reason I raise that in this
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
second section is where we have some
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
struggle with I know that there's been
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
some testimony relative to would a
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
seller remember that they got the letter
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
in the mail did they even open it or did
 
04:26:44.570 --> 04:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
they end up in the waste basket and we
 
04:26:46.250 --> 04:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
concur with those
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
but the other piece as a practitioner
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
this disclosure is the only disclosure
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
that I can think of where you are
 
04:26:59.090 --> 04:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
disclosing a deficiency on an adjoining
 
04:27:01.490 --> 04:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
parcel or a parcel further down the
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
street so you're not disclosing
 
04:27:07.729 --> 04:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
something that is uh wrong or deficient
 
04:27:11.170 --> 04:27:11.180 align:start position:0%
in your subject property but rather
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
again a well that was tested 500 feet
 
04:27:16.969 --> 04:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
away and again that can just go through
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know asbestos dump is your property
 
04:27:20.689 --> 04:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
an asbestos dump is your property a
 
04:27:23.689 --> 04:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
condo what is the water or sewer at your
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
property so
 
04:27:27.410 --> 04:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
um that's the other piece that we're
 
04:27:29.090 --> 04:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
struggling and we're having an issue
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
with again as a whole I think that the
 
04:27:34.969 --> 04:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
the notification piece we're comfortable
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
with some sort of language to add I
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
think that that is appropriate and I
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
believe uh representative harb you
 
04:27:43.729 --> 04:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
mentioned making it effective uh January
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
1 that's good for us to train our
 
04:27:49.130 --> 04:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
practitioners get the two-year
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
accreditation for all of our
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
our instructors and so forth and the
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
forms to be updated that's would be very
 
04:27:59.570 --> 04:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
appreciated as well and I'll accept any
 
04:28:02.210 --> 04:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair
 
04:28:04.610 --> 04:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
any questions by any members of the
 
04:28:04.620 --> 04:28:08.689 align:start position:0%
any questions by any members of the
committee

04:28:08.689 --> 04:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lamontagne thank you Mr
 
04:28:13.130 --> 04:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:28:13.140 --> 04:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:28:16.849 --> 04:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
most of the discussion has been about
 
04:28:20.210 --> 04:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
testing and notification
 
04:28:20.220 --> 04:28:21.070 align:start position:0%
testing and notification
um

04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:24.050 --> 04:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
representing the Realtors do you think
 
04:28:26.210 --> 04:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
it should be common practice
 
04:28:29.809 --> 04:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
to put in real estate contracts that if
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
the water is found to be contaminated
 
04:28:34.610 --> 04:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
that would be a common or should we put
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
in contingency clauses
 
04:28:39.769 --> 04:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
that would allow someone to back out
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the purchase
 
04:28:44.769 --> 04:28:44.779 align:start position:0%
if the water is found to be contaminated
 
04:28:46.790 --> 04:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:28:46.800 --> 04:28:47.870 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:28:50.210 --> 04:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
I think that the
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
so most of my business is on the
 
04:28:54.290 --> 04:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
commercial front and in our world I
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
actually sold property that have had
 
04:28:59.630 --> 04:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
pfas contamination whereby it was
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
discovered but the buyer elected to go
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
ahead without any remediation because we
 
04:29:06.590 --> 04:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
were already on Municipal Water so the
 
04:29:08.210 --> 04:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
determination was it's a known
 
04:29:10.130 --> 04:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
contaminant it's in the ground water
 
04:29:12.110 --> 04:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're not going to drink from the
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
faucet excuse me you're not going to
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
drink from the groundwater because you
 
04:29:18.050 --> 04:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
have it from the municipality
 
04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
we elected not to get out of the deal we
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
elected to move ahead
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
most contracts have some sort of due
 
04:29:28.370 --> 04:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
diligence Clause whereby the buyer and
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
seller agree that the buyer can conduct
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
their diligence we all know in the last
 
04:29:37.370 --> 04:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
18 months uh the amount of diligence
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
being done is very thin because the
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
market is so hot but as we have more
 
04:29:42.000 --> 04:29:43.450 align:start position:0%
market is so hot but as we have more
inventory

04:29:43.450 --> 04:29:43.460 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
the buyers do elect to have a little bit
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
more power and they are performing those
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
diligence items in the same way that
 
04:29:51.250 --> 04:29:51.260 align:start position:0%
they would perform
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
other property inspections like a lead
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
paint test if they so choose
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:02.330 --> 04:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:30:04.010 --> 04:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
what a question
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
Senator Darby
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question all right so talking
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
about disclosures
 
04:30:15.290 --> 04:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
um we were passed out a disclosure in an
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
earlier bill
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
um which I happen to look at and and
 
04:30:20.570 --> 04:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
have a copy online and the disclosure
 
04:30:24.050 --> 04:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
has a statement now about has your water
 
04:30:25.790 --> 04:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
been tested and what were the results
 
04:30:27.969 --> 04:30:27.979 align:start position:0%
and were there any remediations
 
04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
um to uh to add specific questions into
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
that disclosure was attested for you
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
know pfas was it tested for Radon things
 
04:30:42.649 --> 04:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for having the
 
04:30:44.880 --> 04:30:45.889 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for having the
question

04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:30:49.370 --> 04:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that would be fair
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think about our
 
04:30:52.969 --> 04:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
specific disclosures and also the
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
notification these notifications also go
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
within our purchase and sales agreement
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
that the standard forms happy to share
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
those with the committee
 
04:31:03.370 --> 04:31:03.380 align:start position:0%
um relative to your specific question
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
what makes me more comfortable with that
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the language in the bill
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
is again it goes back to
 
04:31:10.439 --> 04:31:11.269 align:start position:0%
is again it goes back to
um

04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
knowledge of something that took place
 
04:31:16.610 --> 04:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
on a property that's not your own and
 
04:31:18.889 --> 04:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
that to me is where I'm wrestling with
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's that you received a letter in the
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
mail on a property that was down the
 
04:31:24.429 --> 04:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
road you may have not opened the letter
 
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
and and again I'm disclosing something
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
that's something that's outside of my
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
the four pillars of my meats and Bounds
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
does that answer the question
 
04:31:33.960 --> 04:31:35.570 align:start position:0%
does that answer the question

and if you would allow me I disability
 
04:33:30.769 --> 04:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
submitted on behalf of the honorable Mr
 
04:33:33.230 --> 04:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
Campbell and he is present this
 
04:33:34.970 --> 04:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
afternoon and can make a better
 
04:33:37.490 --> 04:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
presentation that I can if you
 
04:33:39.170 --> 04:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
will allow me
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
uh I will recognize then if you're
 
04:33:46.131 --> 04:33:46.141 align:start position:0%
finished I will recognize
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.209 --> 04:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
I Am The Honorable Mr Campbell I had the
 
04:33:55.010 --> 04:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve on resources
 
04:33:57.410 --> 04:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
Recreation and development and I hate to
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
say it it was over 20 years ago now
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
um I was a much uh younger man then and
 
04:34:05.449 --> 04:34:05.459 align:start position:0%
uh it's interesting to see that you're
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
stealing dealing with uh speed limits on
 
04:34:09.170 --> 04:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
the Lakes
 
04:34:12.170 --> 04:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
disclosures on water quality
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
and wetlands issues so my hope is to
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
sort of bring the perspective of of why
 
04:34:21.470 --> 04:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
did I file this bill and part of it was
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
partly because one of the bills I passed
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
when I was a representative on resources
 
04:34:28.250 --> 04:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
Recreation and development was a
 
04:34:30.289 --> 04:34:30.299 align:start position:0%
definition of a wetland
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
so prior to 2000 every municipality had
 
04:34:35.570 --> 04:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
their own definition of a wetland and it
 
04:34:37.970 --> 04:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
varied from town to town some would use
 
04:34:40.010 --> 04:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
hydric a soils some would use hydric
 
04:34:42.170 --> 04:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
bees and those areas that were
 
04:34:45.650 --> 04:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
considered a wetland vary greatly from
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
town to town so we what we did in a
 
04:34:51.170 --> 04:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way and I say it was
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisan because there was people on
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle that were for it
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
and there was people on both sides of
 
04:34:58.010 --> 04:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
the aisle that were against it so
 
04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
imagine today 20 years later if you
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have a consistent definition of a
 
04:35:03.000 --> 04:35:04.010 align:start position:0%
didn't have a consistent definition of a
wetland

04:35:04.010 --> 04:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree now that that
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
was a good decision 20 years ago and I
 
04:35:10.730 --> 04:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
can say that that legislation I passed
 
04:35:13.250 --> 04:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
20 years ago is still the law of the
 
04:35:15.609 --> 04:35:15.619 align:start position:0%
land so I think we did something right
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill is very similar except
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
that it deals with Uplands and what the
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
problem I'm seeing is because
 
04:35:25.369 --> 04:35:25.379 align:start position:0%
municipalities can't Define their
 
04:35:28.250 --> 04:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
Wetlands differently they Define the
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
area around their Wetlands differently
 
04:35:34.010 --> 04:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
now in the legislation that we passed we
 
04:35:36.529 --> 04:35:36.539 align:start position:0%
enabled municipalities to define unique
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
features we enabled them to do
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
additional setbacks from Prime wetlands
 
04:35:43.609 --> 04:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
the bill that I'm attempting to pass now
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect Lakes doesn't affect
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
surling protection make sure you read
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
the Des comments it changes no other
 
04:35:53.449 --> 04:35:53.459 align:start position:0%
state permits it doesn't affect any of
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
the Shoreland protection stuff any of
 
04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
the Great Lake stuff any of the Prime
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
Wetland stuff what we're really talking
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
about here is just your run-of-the-mill
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
basic you know
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
Wetland that's uh meets the criteria but
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
isn't considered a prime Wetland isn't a
 
04:36:13.609 --> 04:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
bog is in a kettle hole doesn't change
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
any of the New Hampshire Heritage
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
requirements for endangered species none
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
of that would be affected essentially
 
04:36:23.209 --> 04:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
the point of view that I'm coming from
 
04:36:26.209 --> 04:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
is that you can't in a lot of these
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
towns cut trees down in these buffers
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem for me because I'm
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
a solar power developer now so I build
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
solar trackers and obviously you need
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
access to the sunlight so oddly a lot of
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
towns have adopted ordinances to protect
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
the wetlands in the name of protecting
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
the wetlands and the water quality and
 
04:36:47.929 --> 04:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
the in the critters they've adopted a
 
04:36:51.230 --> 04:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
lot of buffer setbacks and these buffer
 
04:36:52.970 --> 04:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
setbacks in a lot of ways have become
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
green belts or they've even become in
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
some towns conservation easements across
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
the entire State across everyone's
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
property rights so how do you strike the
 
04:37:05.209 --> 04:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
balance between individual property
 
04:37:08.410 --> 04:37:08.420 align:start position:0%
rights and and the need for protecting
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
wetlands and I think the way you you
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
strike that balance is by respecting
 
04:37:15.230 --> 04:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
that you have to meet a minimum
 
04:37:19.131 --> 04:37:19.141 align:start position:0%
threshold of impact a minimum threshold
 
04:37:21.730 --> 04:37:21.740 align:start position:0%
of impact before you have additional
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
conditional overlay districts or
 
04:37:26.929 --> 04:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
conditional use permits so literally I
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
had to get a conditional use permit in
 
04:37:31.010 --> 04:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
one town be because an area where I was
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
mowing which was in within 50 feet of a
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
wetland you know caught in the grass
 
04:37:36.890 --> 04:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's a lawn area happened to be within
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
50 feet of a wetland we were going to
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
put a solar base in the Solar base was
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
literally less than 10 square feet of
 
04:37:43.080 --> 04:37:44.150 align:start position:0%
literally less than 10 square feet of
concrete

04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
04:37:46.250 --> 04:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollars and months and
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
months later in permitting to get a
 
04:37:51.051 --> 04:37:51.061 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit I felt was just a
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
little bit overburdism for what we were
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
doing given the common sense of there
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
was no measurable drainage impact there
 
04:38:01.250 --> 04:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
was no change in the lawn other than the
 
04:38:04.010 --> 04:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
very limited temporary eight by eight
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
disturbance that we were doing so it was
 
04:38:07.609 --> 04:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
just a little bit far-reaching in
 
04:38:09.890 --> 04:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
another town we were able to get a
 
04:38:12.410 --> 04:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
permit to do an intent to cut and we
 
04:38:14.570 --> 04:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
were able to file the appropriate
 
04:38:16.730 --> 04:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
permits to cut all the wetlands but then
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
there was a 25 foot buffer around the
 
04:38:22.131 --> 04:38:22.141 align:start position:0%
whole area of trees that would block our
 
04:38:24.410 --> 04:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
access to the Sun so we had to go
 
04:38:26.090 --> 04:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
through again a lengthy conditional use
 
04:38:28.490 --> 04:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
permit process and it was a process
 
04:38:29.570 --> 04:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
where they said you could have
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely no building within 25 feet of
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
a wetland
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
so this is in my opinion in a you know
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
something that's not enabled under the
 
04:38:41.330 --> 04:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
land use statutes that if you're trying
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
to protect the wetlands from doing
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
something that you're allowed to do in
 
04:38:46.910 --> 04:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
the wetlands I have letters here from
 
04:38:49.730 --> 04:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
Dave Price at DES essentially you can
 
04:38:52.609 --> 04:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
cut in wetlands and some of you might be
 
04:38:54.289 --> 04:38:54.299 align:start position:0%
shocked by that I can tell you I go to a
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
lot of conservation commissions and a
 
04:38:58.609 --> 04:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
lot of planning boards and I explain to
 
04:39:00.170 --> 04:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
them that I don't need a state permit to
 
04:39:02.090 --> 04:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
cut the trees in the wetlands I only
 
04:39:04.250 --> 04:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
need their conditional use permit to cut
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
the trees in the Uplands and they get
 
04:39:08.810 --> 04:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
very angry with me and they think I'm
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
lying I send them an email I tell the
 
04:39:14.209 --> 04:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
planner call Dave Price you know I
 
04:39:15.890 --> 04:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
follow all the state rules I sat on this
 
04:39:17.570 --> 04:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
committee I sat on oversight committees
 
04:39:19.490 --> 04:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
with Des I think I'm a relatively
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
informed guy although I'll admit I still
 
04:39:25.010 --> 04:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
have a lot to learn so I hope that you
 
04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
will understand that I'm not trying to
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
supersede any local control every local
 
04:39:32.449 --> 04:39:32.459 align:start position:0%
ordinance that's currently written can
 
04:39:34.490 --> 04:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
be written it probably doesn't need to
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
be changed the only thing that would
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
happen is you'd have to have three
 
04:39:40.490 --> 04:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet of impervious
 
04:39:40.500 --> 04:39:42.350 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet of impervious
impact

04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:39:43.850 --> 04:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
and so think of that as like a
 
04:39:46.250 --> 04:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
residential house within 50 feet of the
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
wetlands then you would follow all of
 
04:39:51.170 --> 04:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
those additional permitting stuff all of
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
the additional overlay districts you're
 
04:39:56.090 --> 04:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
not going to be exempt from local zoning
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
at all you'd still have to follow local
 
04:40:00.170 --> 04:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
zoning you just wouldn't have to say go
 
04:40:02.690 --> 04:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
to the Conservation Commission and say
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
may I do one thousand square feet of
 
04:40:08.690 --> 04:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
impact 50 feet away from a wetlands
 
04:40:11.930 --> 04:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
so it'd be a very limited threshold and
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
I would submit to you that this is a
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
very good idea because Des Wetlands
 
04:40:17.810 --> 04:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
permits use those same thresholds
 
04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
essentially your your lowest impact Des
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
Wetlands permit is three thousand square
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
feet to do work in a Wetlands so I
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
didn't pick 3 000 square feet in a
 
04:40:28.850 --> 04:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
vacuum I said well if I'm going to do
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
work in an Upland let's pick 3 000
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
square feet as the threshold to trigger
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
additional permitting so all that
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
additional local permitting can stay in
 
04:40:41.330 --> 04:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
place it just can't be triggered unless
 
04:40:43.130 --> 04:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
a homeowner is doing something that
 
04:40:45.170 --> 04:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
exceeds three thousand square feet I
 
04:40:47.570 --> 04:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
watched a neighbor of mine whose uncle
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
came over and popped a stump for him
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
because he had cut a tree down and then
 
04:40:53.330 --> 04:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
they found out it was 44 feet away from
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
the Wetland then they had to do an after
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
the fact conditional use permit they had
 
04:40:59.390 --> 04:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
to survey it they had to do all this
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
figure out a remediation plan to Simply
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
remove one stump
 
04:41:05.930 --> 04:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
and I would just submit to you that that
 
04:41:08.090 --> 04:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
had no impact on the wetlands was an
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable thing to do and I don't
 
04:41:12.770 --> 04:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
even think the town meant to be that
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
judicious about it it was just
 
04:41:16.368 --> 04:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
nonetheless that's the way their local
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
permit read so they had to do it when
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
they looked at it so what I'm asking is
 
04:41:24.470 --> 04:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
that there'd be a threshold before these
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
additional conditional use permits come
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
in and I'll speak a little bit to the
 
04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
planning board process when you go to
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
the planning board and you complete a
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
complete application you meet the
 
04:41:34.610 --> 04:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
threshold that the planning board can
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
make a decision so when we meet that
 
04:41:38.448 --> 04:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
threshold the planning board then says
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
oh we can accept the application as
 
04:41:42.530 --> 04:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
complete and by Statute they have 65
 
04:41:44.690 --> 04:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
days to give you an answer that whole
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
process is now out the window because a
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of these planning boards are
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
doing and say well sorry you need a
 
04:41:51.890 --> 04:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit we need you to go
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
to a third party volunteer board that's
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
not a legislative body that doesn't have
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
the power to vote doesn't have the power
 
04:42:00.650 --> 04:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
to notice people of a public hearing
 
04:42:03.170 --> 04:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary board and you can spend
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
three or four months in that voluntary
 
04:42:07.070 --> 04:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
board explaining that it's okay to cut
 
04:42:08.990 --> 04:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
trees down in a wetland and they don't
 
04:42:10.368 --> 04:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
want to let you cut it down in the
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
Uplands and of course you need to cut
 
04:42:14.990 --> 04:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
trees down for the solar the solar will
 
04:42:16.850 --> 04:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
more than generate the power to do that
 
04:42:19.368 --> 04:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
so this is a private property Rights
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
bill this is a bill that would like when
 
04:42:26.270 --> 04:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
we defined Wetlands bring a semblance at
 
04:42:28.610 --> 04:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
least a minimum threshold of what all
 
04:42:30.650 --> 04:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
the municipalities could do when it
 
04:42:32.330 --> 04:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
comes to these Wetland setbacks remember
 
04:42:34.850 --> 04:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
there is no Wetland setback at the state
 
04:42:34.860 --> 04:42:35.690 align:start position:0%
there is no Wetland setback at the state
level

04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
outside of Shoreland protection outside
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
of great ponds on a wetland there is no
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
State requirement for a setback
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
and you could get a Wetlands permit so
 
04:42:48.050 --> 04:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
on one project we couldn't build in the
 
04:42:50.208 --> 04:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
buffer so we had to kick three tractors
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
into the wetlands and get a Wetlands
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
permit because that was allowed and you
 
04:42:57.410 --> 04:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
could do that so obviously I would have
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
rather built them 10 12 feet into the
 
04:43:03.530 --> 04:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
Upland and not into the wetlands but
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
given that the local
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
body had no administrative remedy maybe
 
04:43:10.910 --> 04:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
a variance but there was no unique
 
04:43:12.770 --> 04:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
condition so they didn't really have to
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
give you a variance so these things are
 
04:43:17.930 --> 04:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
actually hurting wetlands and my number
 
04:43:20.208 --> 04:43:20.218 align:start position:0%
one not my number one but the thesis
 
04:43:21.770 --> 04:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
that a lot of Engineers say to me is
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
when they're doing a Wetlands permit
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
they try really hard to be under 3 000
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to build anywhere
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
near a wetlands and there's this magic
 
04:43:31.490 --> 04:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
number stay 50 feet away and you don't
 
04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
get any local permitting
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to stay 50
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
feet away I would submit everyone
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
because no one wants additional
 
04:43:39.000 --> 04:43:40.128 align:start position:0%
because no one wants additional
permitting

04:43:40.128 --> 04:43:40.138 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
04:43:41.810 --> 04:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I would submit if you had to do work
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
within 50 feet of a Wetlands you would
 
04:43:46.490 --> 04:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
try real hard not to impact more than 3
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
000 square feet
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
so I think this will do more to protect
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
the wetlands in the state of New
 
04:43:54.530 --> 04:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it'll protect property rights
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
by at least saying here's a level that
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know you can go and get a permit and
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
I think that makes it a bipartisan
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully bipartisan way and I don't
 
04:44:06.050 --> 04:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
mean necessarily bipartisan but a way to
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
look at how do we balance property
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
rights and conservation
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
I've done a lot of conservation over the
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
years I've given a lot of land of
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
Confrontation I've done a lot of
 
04:44:17.930 --> 04:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
conservation developments I believe in
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
conservation but I don't think local
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
towns should adopt ordinances that
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
impose a green belt or a conservation
 
04:44:28.010 --> 04:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
easement on your land near Wetlands I
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
think that is a taking of the land and I
 
04:44:32.270 --> 04:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
think that if you're going to have these
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional regulations you need to have
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
that minimum threshold I know that
 
04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's you know obviously opposition
 
04:44:41.448 --> 04:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
every bill and I I'm sure all the people
 
04:44:42.890 --> 04:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
with orange name tags are going to come
 
04:44:44.208 --> 04:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
up and tell you oh the municipal
 
04:44:45.890 --> 04:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
Association oppose the bill and I don't
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
even know if they do I'm just saying
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
that that you would get
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
um concerned about anybody who's going
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
to supersede local rights for local
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
control I'm a live for your guy kind of
 
04:44:59.090 --> 04:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
guy from a small town in Rochester I
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
believe in local control but local
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
control should not mean that you have by
 
04:45:06.770 --> 04:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
ordinance a green belt on your land and
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
local control should not mean thousands
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
and dollars and months and months of
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
additional permitting for minor impacts
 
04:45:16.850 --> 04:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
in an Upland not in a wetland in an
 
04:45:19.730 --> 04:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
Upland and I can go to Des and I can get
 
04:45:22.128 --> 04:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
a Wetlands permit but I can't go to my
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
local planning board or Conservation
 
04:45:28.368 --> 04:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
Commission and get a Uplands permit so
 
04:45:31.368 --> 04:45:31.378 align:start position:0%
that's a problem and I think that it
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense to strike a compromise at
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
the straight level and bring uniformity
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
across all planning boards and all
 
04:45:40.010 --> 04:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
zoning that just says there's a minimum
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
threshold and I'll leave with this I'm
 
04:45:44.208 --> 04:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
open to however you want to skin that
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
cat I picked 3 000 because it was
 
04:45:49.368 --> 04:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
consistent with what Wetlands permits do
 
04:45:51.050 --> 04:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
three thousand ten thousand twenty
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
thousand if you say in the Upland you
 
04:45:56.090 --> 04:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
want it to be 2 000 or a thousand I'm
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
not stuck on that number I just think
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
there has to be a minimum number and I
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
think three thousand is a reasonable
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
number because if it's less than three
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
thousand you don't have drainage issues
 
04:46:10.490 --> 04:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
you don't have you know fast runoff you
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't have the things that might impact
 
04:46:14.090 --> 04:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
a Wetlands because it's such a small
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
area so that's the other reason why I
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
picked the 3000 and I picked the 50-foot
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
setback because that seems to be a
 
04:46:22.970 --> 04:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
popular setback with towns most of them
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
do 50 feet but I will tell you that some
 
04:46:27.410 --> 04:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
towns have 150 foot overlay districts
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
from a regular Wetland and literally
 
04:46:31.970 --> 04:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
have told me I can't build within 150
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
feet so if you own a two acre lot in a
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
commercial Zone which I do and then I'm
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
told I can't build my additional storage
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
units or my additional solar that I got
 
04:46:43.128 --> 04:46:43.138 align:start position:0%
a variance to build and a non-conforming
 
04:46:45.410 --> 04:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
use because of an overlay District that
 
04:46:48.050 --> 04:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
takes away literally half of my lot I
 
04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that that's an
 
04:46:51.010 --> 04:46:51.020 align:start position:0%
economic taking in an economic hardship
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if you know in that site plan that I
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
have we don't have any impervious
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
surface within 50 feet and I've been
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
denied by the planning board and the in
 
04:47:02.750 --> 04:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
the in the local Conservation Commission
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that project there's
 
04:47:06.890 --> 04:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
no impact other than needing to cut
 
04:47:09.410 --> 04:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
trees down so the solar panels can look
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
out across the sky there's no
 
04:47:13.010 --> 04:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
improvement in service surface there's
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
no temporary disturbances other than
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
cutting the vegetation so that's a big
 
04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
motive invasion of why I'm here today is
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be able to develop that
 
04:47:23.448 --> 04:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
property and if you pass a state law
 
04:47:25.128 --> 04:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
that says you have to have a minimum
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
impact or a state law that says if you
 
04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
have no permanent impacts and I Define
 
04:47:31.610 --> 04:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
that in the bill what a permanent impact
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
is can read that if I don't have any of
 
04:47:35.330 --> 04:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
that then I should have a right to build
 
04:47:37.490 --> 04:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
up my property because I'm 50 feet away
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
from a wetland and oddly the same thing
 
04:47:42.770 --> 04:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
applies I could apply for a Wetlands
 
04:47:44.448 --> 04:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
permit to build a little finger of
 
04:47:46.250 --> 04:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
wetlands and it wouldn't be a thing they
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
could do about it because there's no
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit so obviously I
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to move I could actually move
 
04:47:54.050 --> 04:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
one of The Trackers into the Wetland and
 
04:47:55.850 --> 04:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
then make them happy and have a Tracker
 
04:47:58.250 --> 04:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
not in their buffer but that makes no
 
04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
sense to me I'm hopeful that this
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
committee will take the time please meet
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
with me in subcommittee if you want I
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
see you want to exec this on the 8th I'm
 
04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
happy to meet with you between now and
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
the 8th I'm happy to look at amendments
 
04:48:12.170 --> 04:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to address any of the concerns
 
04:48:13.970 --> 04:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
that other stakeholders rightfully might
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
bring up but I want to be clear doesn't
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
change any other state permits
 
04:48:20.570 --> 04:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent local zoning from being
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
in place it just sets a minimum
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
threshold to get it done thank you for
 
04:48:28.670 --> 04:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.288 --> 04:48:30.298 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
04:48:30.298 --> 04:48:33.170 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

04:48:33.170 --> 04:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
04:48:37.128 --> 04:48:37.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
there are some activities that you can
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
do within a Wetlands that you can't do
 
04:48:44.448 --> 04:48:44.458 align:start position:0%
in the buffer
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
I think you cite an example of cutting
 
04:48:49.010 --> 04:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
trees were there other activities Mr
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
Campbell yeah there's there's a lot of
 
04:48:53.690 --> 04:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
activities pretty much every
 
04:48:55.970 --> 04:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
I can do impervious surface in a wetland
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I can do trackers in a wetland I
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
mean you have to get a Wetlands permit
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
from Des which is a process and they do
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say no but in the
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
case of one of my projects I have seven
 
04:49:08.090 --> 04:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
acres of land about three acres of it is
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
Upland and then about four acres of it
 
04:49:12.410 --> 04:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
is wetland so I want to do about what
 
04:49:15.770 --> 04:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
amounts to less than 200 feet of impact
 
04:49:17.930 --> 04:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
in the Wetland in order to spread my
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
trackers out and get the Sun so I would
 
04:49:21.530 --> 04:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
submit that that's a very reasonable
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
thing to do so I can put the concrete
 
04:49:26.570 --> 04:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
base in the underground conduit in the
 
04:49:28.730 --> 04:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
Wetland but I can't put the concrete
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
base in the underground conduit in the
 
04:49:34.128 --> 04:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
Upland near the Wetland because of local
 
04:49:36.650 --> 04:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
zoning in at least three towns that I'm
 
04:49:38.448 --> 04:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
aware of and it sounds like there might
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
be more towns that I think inadvertently
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
have just gone a little too far and
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
because you can cut trees down without a
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
permit the basic justification is oh
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
we're protecting the wetlands you
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
shouldn't cut trees down
 
04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
but you can cut trees down in the
 
04:49:56.570 --> 04:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
Wetland so how is that an item that
 
04:49:59.570 --> 04:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
you're you know enabled to do and I I
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
hate to bring up lawsuits but I only had
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
one lawsuit in my Development Career and
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
it was related to not being able to cut
 
04:50:09.650 --> 04:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
down trees within 15 feet of a property
 
04:50:11.810 --> 04:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
line and the town was saying well we
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
want privacy and we want these trees we
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
went to court with Superior Court they
 
04:50:17.448 --> 04:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
said no that's not a unique feature it
 
04:50:18.890 --> 04:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
was right after we passed the wetlands
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
ordinance and they had to find trees
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
this unique feature and the judge said
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
no trees aren't a unique feature and we
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
live in a state where a lot of people do
 
04:50:28.010 --> 04:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
timber cutting and logging and it's a
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's an industry and to tell people that
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
they can't cut logs down on these wood
 
04:50:34.368 --> 04:50:34.378 align:start position:0%
Lots they would be able to cut the logs
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
in the wetlands on a woodlot but not the
 
04:50:39.530 --> 04:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
logs in a buffer and and so cutting is
 
04:50:40.850 --> 04:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
probably the main thing that you can't
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
do in most of these ordinances but any
 
04:50:44.990 --> 04:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
other construction activity that you can
 
04:50:47.390 --> 04:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
think of almost without exception with a
 
04:50:49.550 --> 04:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
Wetlands permit you can you can do it in
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
the wetlands
 
04:50:55.970 --> 04:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
to follow or follow-up okay thank you so
 
04:50:58.610 --> 04:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
um you're raising issues with towns
 
04:51:00.010 --> 04:51:00.020 align:start position:0%
having different
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
requirements for these buffer zones have
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
you had any
 
04:51:05.930 --> 04:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
um success or have you tried to
 
04:51:08.208 --> 04:51:08.218 align:start position:0%
influence those towns to change those
 
04:51:10.970 --> 04:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
requirements actually I've had a lot of
 
04:51:10.980 --> 04:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
requirements actually I've had a lot of
success

04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
success
 
04:51:12.000 --> 04:51:12.550 align:start position:0%
success
um

04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
Dover is in the process of updating
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
their solar ordinance I brought a solar
 
04:51:20.448 --> 04:51:20.458 align:start position:0%
ordinance that Rochester is the city of
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
Rochester is bringing online it's been
 
04:51:23.170 --> 04:51:23.180 align:start position:0%
about a one year process
 
04:51:25.368 --> 04:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
and they had a they had their first
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
public reading uh two days ago so
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I would submit to you that it's
 
04:51:32.208 --> 04:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
possible to influence those things at a
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
local level and I would also submit to
 
04:51:35.690 --> 04:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
you that I think most of those talents
 
04:51:37.490 --> 04:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
have been reasonable and sympathetic in
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester although I blatantly broke
 
04:51:43.250 --> 04:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
their their no cut buffer
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
um because I did it quite honestly as
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
part of a Timber Harvest and I had no
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
idea given that I had permits to cut in
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
the wetlands that I couldn't just cut
 
04:51:53.810 --> 04:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
the law we were doing a change of use
 
04:51:56.570 --> 04:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
the bazel law didn't apply and we cut it
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
and then a year later I go to the
 
04:51:59.208 --> 04:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
planning board and they're like what do
 
04:52:00.530 --> 04:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
you mean you cut all the trees I cut
 
04:52:02.510 --> 04:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
them a year ago like oh you can't do
 
04:52:04.490 --> 04:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
that I'm like are you serious so they
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
were very understanding because they
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
knew I wasn't trying to skirt their
 
04:52:11.090 --> 04:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
rules I just was like jumping into the
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
cold lake when someone told me that I
 
04:52:15.470 --> 04:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right to cut trees and
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
harvest Timber on my land and I'm not
 
04:52:19.128 --> 04:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
saying I'm a logger but over the years
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
I've I've made a little bit of money
 
04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
buying wood lots and cutting the wood
 
04:52:24.650 --> 04:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
lot and selling the wood and then
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
developing it later or selling it it
 
04:52:28.730 --> 04:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's a way a lot of people in New
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire make a living and I would
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
submit to you that if you have these
 
04:52:35.810 --> 04:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
Green Belt buffers even though they have
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
been accommodating for the most part
 
04:52:40.610 --> 04:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
that you should have a minimum threshold
 
04:52:43.128 --> 04:52:43.138 align:start position:0%
as Guidance just like we have a minimum
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
threshold of the three criteria for a
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
wetland it's the same the same
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
philosophy so I hope that you guys will
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
support that philosophy
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions members of
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:53:05.330 --> 04:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
of Representative LaMontagne uh thank
 
04:53:07.310 --> 04:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:53:07.320 --> 04:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:53:10.910 --> 04:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm having a little hard time following
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
04:53:13.080 --> 04:53:14.030 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
um

04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you can do just about
 
04:53:19.310 --> 04:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
anything in the wetlands but you still
 
04:53:21.288 --> 04:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
have to get a permit to do it it's not
 
04:53:24.288 --> 04:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
that you don't go through a process in
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
order to do those activities in the
 
04:53:28.970 --> 04:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
Wetland correct
 
04:53:28.980 --> 04:53:29.690 align:start position:0%
Wetland correct
um

04:53:29.690 --> 04:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
sort of if I was putting Concrete in a
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
wetland in a permanent and serious
 
04:53:34.850 --> 04:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
surface you would need at least a
 
04:53:37.850 --> 04:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
minimum impact permit but if I was just
 
04:53:40.190 --> 04:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
cutting trees in a wetland I would not
 
04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
need a permit in most Wetlands you can
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
cut I brought a copy of the
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules because I know some
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
people find that hard to believe and I'm
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
happy to share that with the committee
 
04:53:51.410 --> 04:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you need me to but I would hope that
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
you would trust me when I tell you that
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
yes you can cut trees in a wetland
 
04:53:56.930 --> 04:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
without a permit you just have to use
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
best management practices which means
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
dry soil conditions Frozen soil
 
04:54:04.368 --> 04:54:04.378 align:start position:0%
conditions when you cut in a wetland but
 
04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
you are absolutely allowed under New
 
04:54:09.890 --> 04:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law to cut trees in a
 
04:54:09.900 --> 04:54:11.448 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law to cut trees in a
wetland

04:54:11.448 --> 04:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
so you would not need a permit to answer
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
your question you would not need a
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
permit to cut trees in a wetland but you
 
04:54:20.208 --> 04:54:20.218 align:start position:0%
would need a conditional use permit to
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
cut trees in an Upland and some
 
04:54:24.650 --> 04:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
communities have chosen not to issue
 
04:54:26.930 --> 04:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
those conditional use permits literally
 
04:54:28.490 --> 04:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
on the grounds that we might hurt the
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
wetlands that we can cut so that's and
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's the Dilemma that I think we need
 
04:54:36.770 --> 04:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
to set a minimum standard and in the
 
04:54:39.288 --> 04:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
bill I do Define what a disturbance is
 
04:54:40.910 --> 04:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I Define what a temporary
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
disturbance is so in one town we looked
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
at a disturbance and it said basically
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know cut vegetation turn soil
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
um have a permanent impact so like
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
Wetlands I thought that meant Wetlands
 
04:55:00.288 --> 04:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
vegetation seasonal high water table and
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
soil type
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
thus is a wetland two is not
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
two of these is not
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
you need all three to be defined as a
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
Wetlands by a wetland scientists
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
I thought in order to be considered a
 
04:55:14.570 --> 04:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
disturbance in their buffer you needed
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
to do all three and and it wasn't clear
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
the ordinance wasn't clear the ordinance
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
allowed for Timber harvesting to happen
 
04:55:23.570 --> 04:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
in their buffer without a auto permit
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
um but essentially I got an
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
administrative decision that said no if
 
04:55:29.208 --> 04:55:29.218 align:start position:0%
you caught you need a conditional use
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
permit and that's where I think there's
 
04:55:34.610 --> 04:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
a major problem with the state not just
 
04:55:37.368 --> 04:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
setting down a basic guideline that I
 
04:55:39.948 --> 04:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
hope you can see as reasonable just like
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
we came together 20 years ago and said
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
that having a definition from a wetland
 
04:55:46.368 --> 04:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable thing so I think a
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
hopefully a a definition for a minimum
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
impact before you trigger this
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
additional local land use perming that
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
you can still do you just would need to
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
be impacting at least three thousand
 
04:55:59.930 --> 04:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
square feet before you got that
 
04:56:01.850 --> 04:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
additional permit just like in a
 
04:56:03.530 --> 04:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
Wetlands before you have to apply for a
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
permit you have to be doing more than
 
04:56:07.910 --> 04:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
just cutting trees
 
04:56:07.920 --> 04:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
just cutting trees
okay

04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:15.170 --> 04:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
that didn't answer your question
 
04:56:17.690 --> 04:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
yes okay thanks
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
then turn it off
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishes to ask a
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.560 --> 04:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:56:29.750 --> 04:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay I presume that's not a question
 
04:56:41.890 --> 04:56:41.900 align:start position:0%
she was just asking for me oh okay
 
04:56:44.330 --> 04:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
nobody asked me that's an important
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much thank you
 
04:56:52.270 --> 04:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
04:56:57.708 --> 04:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
I'll call uh
 
04:57:00.530 --> 04:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
Darlene Horst
 
04:57:14.090 --> 04:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.890 --> 04:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
Representatives thank you for allowing
 
04:57:17.690 --> 04:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity to speak today my name
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
is Darlene Forrest I am currently the
 
04:57:21.890 --> 04:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
administrator of the wetlands Bureau at
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:57:24.770 --> 04:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
04:57:27.650 --> 04:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
we did email a letter of testimony to
 
04:57:29.570 --> 04:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee hopefully it
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
was distributed already I will note
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
there is a typo in that email and it
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
cites Roman numeral
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
title Roman numeral
 
04:57:43.490 --> 04:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
X1 XIV it should be lxiv I do have
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
corrected copies if anyone feels like
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
that is a matter of great importance
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
that they want to
 
04:57:51.708 --> 04:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
have a corrected copy before I leave
 
04:57:51.718 --> 04:57:53.030 align:start position:0%
have a corrected copy before I leave
today

04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
that said
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
um what we would like to to state today
 
04:57:59.810 --> 04:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
is having listened to the gentleman's
 
04:58:01.730 --> 04:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
testimony just now
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
the language that we see in this bill
 
04:58:07.970 --> 04:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
might not do exactly what its intention
 
04:58:07.980 --> 04:58:09.288 align:start position:0%
might not do exactly what its intention
is

04:58:09.288 --> 04:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:58:11.930 --> 04:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
what we see in this bill is language
 
04:58:13.730 --> 04:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
not allow a town to regulate any project
 
04:58:19.368 --> 04:58:19.378 align:start position:0%
that has
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
any amount of impact provided there's
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
less than three thousand square feet of
 
04:58:26.570 --> 04:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
new impervious that happens within 50
 
04:58:28.368 --> 04:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
feet of a wetland
 
04:58:30.170 --> 04:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
frankly that is a matter of local
 
04:58:30.180 --> 04:58:31.070 align:start position:0%
frankly that is a matter of local
control

04:58:31.070 --> 04:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:58:33.530 --> 04:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with the impart

local control that is that is a very
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
passionate issue in the state of New
 
04:58:46.250 --> 04:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that many people would like to
 
04:58:48.890 --> 04:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
discuss we have enough to do
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
what we would like to ask is since this
 
04:58:53.570 --> 04:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
does not affect State permitting and it
 
04:58:55.010 --> 04:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
does not affect the way the state
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
approaches Wetlands it is a matter of
 
04:59:00.490 --> 04:59:00.500 align:start position:0%
local control it would seem far more
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
transparent if it was located in title
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
LX 1V whatever Roman numeral that
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
equates to which is Planning and Zoning
 
04:59:13.550 --> 04:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
where local municipalities will expect
 
04:59:14.810 --> 04:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
to find it
 
04:59:18.170 --> 04:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
where it can be properly you know
 
04:59:18.180 --> 04:59:19.850 align:start position:0%
where it can be properly you know
transparent

04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
04:59:19.860 --> 04:59:20.690 align:start position:0%
transparent
um

04:59:20.690 --> 04:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:23.090 --> 04:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
and discussed
 
04:59:25.610 --> 04:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
so that is our that's that's the the sum
 
04:59:28.090 --> 04:59:28.100 align:start position:0%
total of what we would like to say we do
 
04:59:30.288 --> 04:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
truly believe that
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
for clarity
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
this is not a Wetlands issue and does
 
04:59:36.170 --> 04:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
not belong in Wetland statute or at
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for uh
 
04:59:50.270 --> 04:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.610 --> 04:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative harp requested
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking this
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that in this
 
04:59:58.850 --> 04:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
proposed that talks about the 3000 feet
 
05:00:02.930 --> 05:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
of permanent impervious impact
 
05:00:04.730 --> 05:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
would it make a difference to you if it
 
05:00:14.448 --> 05:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
unto us and it's all about whether or
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
not a town has a right to require a
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
permit or put in an overlay
 
05:00:22.850 --> 05:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
so our position would again be this is a
 
05:00:24.410 --> 05:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
matter of local control and should be in
 
05:00:28.490 --> 05:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning statutes thank you
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
I I have a question in uh the buffer
 
05:00:38.090 --> 05:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
zones are
 
05:00:43.010 --> 05:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
buffer zones part of the uh part of the
 
05:00:46.610 --> 05:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
wetlands ordinances a Wetlands laws of
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
05:00:51.310 --> 05:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
under your jurisdiction
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
so there are two buffers that are
 
05:00:55.850 --> 05:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
allowed under specifically the Wetland
 
05:00:58.150 --> 05:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
statute one is for a period of time
 
05:01:00.890 --> 05:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
towns who designated Prime Wetlands had
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
the ability to adopt with that a 100
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
foot right Prime Wetland buffer there's
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
also the 100 foot tidal buffer zone
 
05:01:10.128 --> 05:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
those are the only two state level
 
05:01:10.138 --> 05:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
those are the only two state level
buffers

05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
buffers
 
05:01:13.970 --> 05:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
I will note this the reason that we do
 
05:01:15.170 --> 05:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
not require
 
05:01:17.628 --> 05:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
a permit to cut trees in Wetlands is
 
05:01:19.490 --> 05:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
because the legislature has not given us
 
05:01:21.770 --> 05:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
the authority to require a permit to cut
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
trees and wetlands we have we require
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
permits for construction excavation
 
05:01:27.360 --> 05:01:28.970 align:start position:0%
permits for construction excavation
dredge

05:01:28.970 --> 05:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
dredge
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
and fill sorry excavation removal and
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
fill none of those describe the cutting
 
05:01:36.770 --> 05:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
of trees so we leave that to the
 
05:01:38.690 --> 05:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural Resources we just
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulate fill for roads
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
um we're not asking for that right now
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
but the explanation for why that there's
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
a discrepancy there is we don't have
 
05:01:49.610 --> 05:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
that Authority
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh I will also note that I know of
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
nothing within wetland's statute which
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the town from adopting
 
05:01:58.610 --> 05:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
such Authority
 
05:01:58.620 --> 05:01:59.868 align:start position:0%
such Authority
okay

05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:02.830 --> 05:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.040 --> 05:02:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
Margaret burns from New Hampshire
 
05:02:35.208 --> 05:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Margaret burns the
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
executive director excuse me of the
 
05:02:40.610 --> 05:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and we are here
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
this afternoon in opposition to house
 
05:02:46.010 --> 05:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
bill 592. I guess I'd like to start by
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
echoing the prior testimony that the
 
05:02:50.510 --> 05:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
matter involved with this bill is a
 
05:02:52.850 --> 05:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
matter of local control and that is the
 
05:02:54.770 --> 05:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
main reason for our opposition to the
 
05:02:57.410 --> 05:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
bill I would also like to agree with
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
prior testimony that should a bill like
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
this pass it certainly does not belong
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
in RSA chapter 482 the authority of
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate zoning is
 
05:03:12.650 --> 05:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
found in RSA chapter 674 and 674 section
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
17 and 674 section 21 specifically give
 
05:03:20.090 --> 05:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities the authority to identify
 
05:03:22.730 --> 05:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
and create regulations that preserve
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
natural resources and that is part of
 
05:03:28.970 --> 05:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
most zoning ordinances as I said the
 
05:03:30.770 --> 05:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
main reason for our opposition is that
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
this would override local control
 
05:03:35.810 --> 05:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
I believe I heard some testimony earlier
 
05:03:37.850 --> 05:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
that I thought I understood to be that
 
05:03:40.610 --> 05:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
this would not require the rewriting or
 
05:03:43.490 --> 05:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
changing of local zoning ordinances but
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
there are many municipalities that have
 
05:03:48.288 --> 05:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
enacted local Wetlands buffer ordinances
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
that would be impacted by House Bill 592
 
05:03:53.690 --> 05:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
if it were to pass and would therefore
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
override their ability at the local
 
05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
level to make these decisions
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
many municipalities as I understand it
 
05:04:03.410 --> 05:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
do require additional permits for
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
impervious impact projects of less than
 
05:04:08.208 --> 05:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
100 square feet I understand that the
 
05:04:10.128 --> 05:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
rationale for these requirements is
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
concern over cumulative impacts of many
 
05:04:14.690 --> 05:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
different projects and what that can
 
05:04:16.490 --> 05:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
mean for the area and for the natural
 
05:04:19.550 --> 05:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
resources our municipalities have worked
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
hard to look at and identify natural
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
resources and to pass local ordinances
 
05:04:26.570 --> 05:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
to address these issues to preserve
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
water quality other natural resources
 
05:04:31.850 --> 05:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
wildlife and all the things that go
 
05:04:34.010 --> 05:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
along with Wetlands organ offenses and
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
wetlands buffer ordinances so we would
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee to see
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
this as a local issue as an issue
 
05:04:43.368 --> 05:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
already addressed in existing law giving
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
cities and towns the authority to
 
05:04:47.208 --> 05:04:47.218 align:start position:0%
regulate through zoning and to recommend
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
this bill as inexpedient to legislate I
 
05:04:52.128 --> 05:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
am happy to take any questions that the
 
05:04:53.930 --> 05:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
committee has but I would like to note
 
05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
that there are people sitting behind me
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
far more knowledgeable with respect to
 
05:05:01.128 --> 05:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
Wetlands ordinances and wetlands buffers
 
05:05:03.650 --> 05:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
who are probably better positioned to
 
05:05:05.690 --> 05:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
answer your specific questions if you
 
05:05:08.090 --> 05:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
have them and I have submitted written
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of the municipal
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
Association via email earlier today
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
05:05:17.700 --> 05:05:20.570 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

05:05:20.570 --> 05:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
see none

05:05:41.090 --> 05:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the ability to
 
05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
provide testimony on House Bill 592 my
 
05:05:46.128 --> 05:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
name is Barbara Richter I'm the
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
executive director at the New Hampshire

Association of conservation commissions
 
05:05:53.810 --> 05:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
nhacc is a non-profit organization that
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
serves 217 conservation commissions here
 
05:05:57.410 --> 05:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
many of our members as well as our board
 
05:06:04.670 --> 05:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
are opposed to house bill 592.
 
05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that this bill is
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
unclear it should not be part of RSA 482
 
05:06:14.690 --> 05:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
a and it also limits Municipal rights
 
05:06:16.610 --> 05:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
another concern we have is that the
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
lodge the language does not address the
 
05:06:21.530 --> 05:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
restoration or best management practices
 
05:06:23.930 --> 05:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
of those temporary impacts
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
just because a project is small does not
 
05:06:28.250 --> 05:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
mean that it doesn't cause erosion
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
siltation or compacted soils
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
often temporary can mean two or more
 
05:06:36.770 --> 05:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
years so there really can be some
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
significant impacts when you're looking
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
at some of these smaller projects so
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
please vote an expedient to legislate on
 
05:06:46.730 --> 05:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 592.
 
05:06:49.070 --> 05:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
towns should be able to use a
 
05:06:50.930 --> 05:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
science-based approach in their decision
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
making and this bill would limit that
 
05:06:53.280 --> 05:06:54.170 align:start position:0%
making and this bill would limit that
power

05:06:54.170 --> 05:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
power
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
loss of wetlands is an increasing threat
 
05:06:58.970 --> 05:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
to our health and our environment
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire loses approximately 90
 
05:07:04.850 --> 05:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
Acres of wetlands every year and with
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
that loss is a significant loss in our
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.160 --> 05:07:12.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:07:12.170 --> 05:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:14.810 --> 05:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
Wetlands provide groundwater recharge
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
for our drinking water
 
05:07:20.090 --> 05:07:20.100 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
ly and towns really understand this and
 
05:07:35.690 --> 05:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
they're trying very hard to protect
 
05:07:38.270 --> 05:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
these significant resources currently
 
05:07:40.610 --> 05:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
about 70 percent of New Hampshire towns
 
05:07:43.430 --> 05:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
have local Wetland regulations and the
 
05:07:46.128 --> 05:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
ones that I have read do allow for
 
05:07:48.770 --> 05:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
forestry and agriculture so they they do
 
05:07:51.050 --> 05:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
permit a lot of the uses that we're
 
05:07:53.448 --> 05:07:53.458 align:start position:0%
concerned about today
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
restricting local regulations will will
 
05:07:57.530 --> 05:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
come at a cost to New Hampshire
 
05:07:57.540 --> 05:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
come at a cost to New Hampshire
municipalities

05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:08:03.288 --> 05:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
right now House Bill 276 is asking for
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars to help address
 
05:08:05.878 --> 05:08:07.730 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars to help address
cyanobacteria

05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
and if we can't protect our Wetlands
 
05:08:11.810 --> 05:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
we'll just continue to see these
 
05:08:15.230 --> 05:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
increases in Need for funding to support
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
our health and well-being so please vote
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill 592. I'd be happy to
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
05:08:26.638 --> 05:08:31.190 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:08:36.288 --> 05:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
as I I'm a former conservation
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner as I see right now
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
seven towns have buffers of less than 50
 
05:08:47.400 --> 05:08:49.030 align:start position:0%
seven towns have buffers of less than 50
feet

05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
feet
 
05:08:52.970 --> 05:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
at least 27 so far that I see have child
 
05:08:57.288 --> 05:08:57.298 align:start position:0%
have buffers of zones of over 50 feet is
 
05:09:01.010 --> 05:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
my question is if my town only has a
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
buffer of 25 feet and this is put in
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
place just now my town have to have a
 
05:09:09.890 --> 05:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
buffer of 50 feet
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a very good question I'm
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
probably not able to answer that just by
 
05:09:17.330 --> 05:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
reading this um the language in this
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill so it's hard to clarify how that's
 
05:09:22.850 --> 05:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
going to impact those local regulations
 
05:09:26.090 --> 05:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have this concern thank
 
05:09:26.100 --> 05:09:28.730 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have this concern thank
you

05:09:28.730 --> 05:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:30.890 --> 05:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
 
05:09:30.900 --> 05:09:32.868 align:start position:0%
any other questions from members of the
committee

05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:09:35.868 --> 05:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
may I add one more
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
piece to to address
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I do understand that solar
 
05:09:43.490 --> 05:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
regulations could be an issue here
 
05:09:45.170 --> 05:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and I do don't know that a lot of
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
towns are working hard to update their
 
05:09:49.550 --> 05:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
solar regulations or even you know
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
create them many towns don't have a
 
05:09:52.200 --> 05:09:53.170 align:start position:0%
create them many towns don't have a
specific

05:09:53.170 --> 05:09:53.180 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:09:55.250 --> 05:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
zoning to
 
05:09:58.250 --> 05:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
deal with solar power and I can
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
understand how that could be a problem
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's the wetlands that
 
05:10:03.000 --> 05:10:04.190 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's the wetlands that
were

05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:10:06.770 --> 05:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
at issue here because
 
05:10:06.780 --> 05:10:07.550 align:start position:0%
at issue here because
um

05:10:07.550 --> 05:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
there there's you know there's
 
05:10:10.250 --> 05:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
definitely a need for updated
 
05:10:13.070 --> 05:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
regulations in a lot of communities and
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
again solar is one that they're trying
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
hard to kind of keep up to date with so
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
any any other questions the members of
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing none
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:10:38.330 --> 05:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair uh rentugo and
 
05:10:43.250 --> 05:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm here
 
05:10:46.730 --> 05:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
representing myself I have spent many
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
years on my Town's planning board and
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission which I'm both
 
05:10:54.650 --> 05:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
currently on and I am also a
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
professional Wetland scientist so I'd
 
05:10:58.128 --> 05:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
like to review
 
05:11:00.610 --> 05:11:00.620 align:start position:0%
um I did submit uh written
 
05:11:03.288 --> 05:11:03.298 align:start position:0%
testimony as well although it didn't go
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
through the first time but I'd like to
 
05:11:08.448 --> 05:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
um go through that and then I'd make
 
05:11:10.788 --> 05:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
some other points so I'm writing to
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
express my opposition to House Bill 592
 
05:11:15.530 --> 05:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
which seeks to significantly reduce the
 
05:11:17.750 --> 05:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
ability of municipalities to protect
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
local Wetland resources this bill
 
05:11:21.770 --> 05:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
undermines the protection of State
 
05:11:24.650 --> 05:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
Wetland and surface water resources upon
 
05:11:27.050 --> 05:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
which all of us depend on to live and
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
enjoy what New Hampshire has to offer
 
05:11:31.310 --> 05:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
direct impacts to New Hampshire's
 
05:11:32.930 --> 05:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
wetlands and surface waters have been
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
regulated under state law since 1967. in
 
05:11:38.448 --> 05:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
recognition of the significant role
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
Wetlands play in protecting water
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
quality and quantity mitigation
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
mitigating flood waters and providing
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat among other functions
 
05:11:49.910 --> 05:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
however Wetlands cannot perform these
 
05:11:52.250 --> 05:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
functions effectively without buffers
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Upland areas adjacent to Wetlands
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
are crucial to many of the functions and
 
05:12:00.770 --> 05:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
values of wetlands and surface waters
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
while the state's Wetland RSA 42a
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
regulates activities and buffers to some
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
resources as Ms Forrest mentioned RSA
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
674 colon 21 Roman numeral 1j authorizes
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
municipalities to enact environmental
 
05:12:19.970 --> 05:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
characteristic zoning to better protect
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
local wetlands and other resources
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
I'll address a couple of points about
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
the importance of buffers and the Not So
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
in insignificant issues with temporary
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
impacts in my letter there is a diagram
 
05:12:36.368 --> 05:12:36.378 align:start position:0%
from a Connecticut River joint
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
commission's publication that
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
illustrates the general distances at
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
which buffers protect certain functions
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
of wetlands and streams vegetated
 
05:12:48.890 --> 05:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
buffers intercept sediment nutrients
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
pesticides and other materials in
 
05:12:52.490 --> 05:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
surface runoff
 
05:12:55.368 --> 05:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
sediments carry phosphorus a fertilizer
 
05:12:57.650 --> 05:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
to our wetlands and surface waters when
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
there are inadequate buffers
 
05:13:01.850 --> 05:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
for nutrient removal and sediment
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
control functions to protect water
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
quality according to the diagram and a
 
05:13:09.770 --> 05:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
significant body of research the buffers
 
05:13:13.490 --> 05:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
needed range from 75 to 125 feet in
 
05:13:13.500 --> 05:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
needed range from 75 to 125 feet in
width

05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
width
 
05:13:17.470 --> 05:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has had increasing
 
05:13:21.948 --> 05:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms in 2021 Des issued
 
05:13:24.890 --> 05:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
32 Health advisories and over 40 alerts
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
which was at that time a record-breaking
 
05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
year for observed wombs such blooms are
 
05:13:31.730 --> 05:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
toxic to people and animals and can
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
create taste and odor issues in drinking
 
05:13:33.958 --> 05:13:34.788 align:start position:0%
create taste and odor issues in drinking
water

05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:13:37.310 --> 05:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
Research indicates that cyanobacteria
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
abundance increases as light nutrients
 
05:13:42.770 --> 05:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
increase if the ability to protect
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
Wetland buffers that assist in water
 
05:13:47.810 --> 05:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
quality protection our Wetlands lakes
 
05:13:49.490 --> 05:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
and streams and the real estate near
 
05:13:52.368 --> 05:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
them will be negatively affected
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 592's reference the temporary
 
05:13:57.530 --> 05:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
impacts is based on a presumption that
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
temporary impacts are just that however
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is not accurate temporary impacts
 
05:14:05.810 --> 05:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
can create long-term disturbances which
 
05:14:08.208 --> 05:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
provide an open invitation for invasive
 
05:14:10.970 --> 05:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
plants to move in even if the area has
 
05:14:13.610 --> 05:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
been revegetated invasive plants
 
05:14:15.650 --> 05:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
negatively affect wildlife and can
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
impair the use of our wetlands and other
 
05:14:20.570 --> 05:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
resources water resources so I hope the
 
05:14:22.730 --> 05:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
committee will consider House Bill 592
 
05:14:27.170 --> 05:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
as an expedient to legislate thank you I
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
if I may say one more thing before
 
05:14:33.170 --> 05:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
um uh there was a earlier testimony
 
05:14:35.868 --> 05:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned about tree cutting I do want
 
05:14:39.650 --> 05:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
to mention that in 2012 uh planning uh
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
changes to the 674 restricted planning
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
boards ability to regulate tree cutting
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
and they can only do that as part of
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision or site plan approval so
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
outright tree cutting is not
 
05:14:55.680 --> 05:14:56.350 align:start position:0%
outright tree cutting is not
um

05:14:56.350 --> 05:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:59.448 --> 05:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
restricted except under
 
05:14:59.458 --> 05:15:00.530 align:start position:0%
restricted except under
um

05:15:00.530 --> 05:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision and site plan approvals so
 
05:15:05.930 --> 05:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's where buffers can be in place and
 
05:15:05.940 --> 05:15:08.470 align:start position:0%
that's where buffers can be in place and
vegetation

05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
vegetation
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
non-disturbance can be required okay
 
05:15:13.550 --> 05:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:15.530 --> 05:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
05:15:15.540 --> 05:15:18.590 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

05:15:18.590 --> 05:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:20.810 --> 05:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:15:29.230 --> 05:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
05:15:36.780 --> 05:15:45.230 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Timberland Owners
Association

05:15:45.230 --> 05:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:48.170 --> 05:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon uh for the record
 
05:15:49.610 --> 05:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'm Jason stock I'm with the New
 
05:15:51.050 --> 05:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
I didn't plan to actually speak on this
 
05:15:53.638 --> 05:15:54.530 align:start position:0%
I didn't plan to actually speak on this
bill

05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
but the question of tree cutting has
 
05:15:59.390 --> 05:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
come up and buffers and and so forth and
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
as the prior speaker spoke the the the
 
05:16:07.690 --> 05:16:07.700 align:start position:0%
state statute was changed RSA 674 1
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
Roman 6 which is very clear it states
 
05:16:12.410 --> 05:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
that planning boards shall not have the
 
05:16:14.208 --> 05:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate Timber harvesting
 
05:16:16.970 --> 05:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
except in the case of projects subject
 
05:16:19.310 --> 05:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
site plan review it's or subdivision
 
05:16:24.650 --> 05:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me those are the two subdivision
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
or site plan review
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
this was a piece of legislation that we
 
05:16:30.288 --> 05:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
had worked on
 
05:16:32.810 --> 05:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um a lot of merchantable Timber does
 
05:16:35.090 --> 05:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
grow in what are technically Wetlands
 
05:16:36.890 --> 05:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
when you look at the three criteria and
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
you look at certain tree species red
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
Maples a great example of a tree species
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
that can infect and does grow in in
 
05:16:46.850 --> 05:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
soils that are that would that could be
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
considered Wetlands so
 
05:16:53.810 --> 05:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
um and right now to harvest Timber you
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
can harvest in a wetland legally you can
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
harvest in the Upland as well if you're
 
05:17:02.330 --> 05:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
going to harvest in the Wetland though
 
05:17:04.850 --> 05:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
the laws and rules are very clear you
 
05:17:07.128 --> 05:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
have to do it under Frozen or dry
 
05:17:07.138 --> 05:17:09.010 align:start position:0%
have to do it under Frozen or dry
conditions

05:17:09.010 --> 05:17:09.020 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:17:12.890 --> 05:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
and if there is a channel if there's a
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
defined Channel you're obligated to get
 
05:17:18.128 --> 05:17:18.138 align:start position:0%
a Wetlands permit to cross that channel
 
05:17:21.770 --> 05:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
to access the other side so if you think
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
of a forest you think of a brook you got
 
05:17:26.930 --> 05:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
a defined Channel you either Bridge it
 
05:17:29.628 --> 05:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
or you put in a Ford of some type to
 
05:17:31.730 --> 05:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
cross that there's a wetland permitting
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
process Des regulates that we also have
 
05:17:37.490 --> 05:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
forest rangers across the state that
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
also have regulatory Authority so Timber
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
harvesting has and does occur in in
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
Wetlands it is not uncommon like I said
 
05:17:51.050 --> 05:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
many tree species red maple Spruce fur
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
particularly up north you get up north
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of what what are
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
considered technically Wetlands it's
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
merchantable Timber it's been managed
 
05:18:00.410 --> 05:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
for Generations
 
05:18:03.050 --> 05:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to provide that that Clarity
 
05:18:06.170 --> 05:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll mention is that this
 
05:18:08.330 --> 05:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
question about Wetlands Authority was
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
tested in court in Rockingham Superior
 
05:18:11.280 --> 05:18:12.288 align:start position:0%
tested in court in Rockingham Superior
Court

05:18:12.288 --> 05:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
Court
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
um Justice Delker made a decision I
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
think it was the town of North
 
05:18:18.770 --> 05:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
I get my Hamptons confused I think it
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
was Northampton there was a town with a
 
05:18:24.650 --> 05:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
Wetlands ordinance had buffers they went
 
05:18:26.810 --> 05:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
to do a Timber Just a standard Timber
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
sale their Forester
 
05:18:31.550 --> 05:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh ran into the the town came in and
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
issued a cease and desist
 
05:18:36.770 --> 05:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
the landowner
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
in this case Ron and Nancy bottom
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
um took the decided to challenge the
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
ordinance it went to the Rockingham
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and Justice Delker was I
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
couldn't be any couldn't be any clearer
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
he actually issued he said that the
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
ordinance did not have standing as
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this to 674 and in fact he
 
05:19:03.770 --> 05:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
issued a writ of mandamus in this case
 
05:19:06.050 --> 05:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
for the town to sign the intent to cut
 
05:19:08.930 --> 05:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
so that they could begin harvesting so
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
which is a writ of mandamus is usually a
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
pretty intense order for a judge to
 
05:19:18.288 --> 05:19:18.298 align:start position:0%
actually sit and tell a town order them
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
05:19:23.208 --> 05:19:23.218 align:start position:0%
so this this law is on the books and it
 
05:19:25.010 --> 05:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
has been tested
 
05:19:26.990 --> 05:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
um Timber harvesting it's an ephemeral
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
activity it comes it goes the trees grow
 
05:19:32.090 --> 05:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
back and we actually have landowners
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
that will manage land in for in Wetlands
 
05:19:38.570 --> 05:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
for wildlife to create new growth for
 
05:19:40.190 --> 05:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
yes we do have members that want to
 
05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
attract beavers to their property and
 
05:19:43.610 --> 05:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
they want to get saplings up because
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's what beavers like to eat so with
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude my testimony and I'll
 
05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
05:19:54.010 --> 05:19:54.020 align:start position:0%
any uh any questions from the rep
 
05:19:56.690 --> 05:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
05:20:00.650 --> 05:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
you're cutting in these Wetlands you
 
05:20:02.270 --> 05:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
have to cross these buffers to get to
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
the wetlands true so how do you work
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
with the local towns to get permission
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
to cross the buffers
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
great question the buffers are
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
considered Uplands and so those are
 
05:20:17.570 --> 05:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
those the buffer areas and and this is
 
05:20:18.890 --> 05:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
where I think some of the confusions
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
coming in the buffers deal with projects
 
05:20:24.288 --> 05:20:24.298 align:start position:0%
that are typically associated with site
 
05:20:25.730 --> 05:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
plan review
 
05:20:29.448 --> 05:20:29.458 align:start position:0%
or subdivision forestry and as you heard
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
in some of the prior speakers on these
 
05:20:34.490 --> 05:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
Wetlands overlay districts towns across
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
the state are crystal clear traditional
 
05:20:39.170 --> 05:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
uses such as Ag and Forestry you're
 
05:20:41.570 --> 05:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
